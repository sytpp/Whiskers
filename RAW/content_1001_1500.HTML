<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise in emissions from burning coal, oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels was one of the steepest on record in the last 25 years, according to the Energy Information Administration's Monthly Energy Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in carbon pollution is a setback for Obama, who has been heavily promoting his progres s in cutting America's greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told 120 world leaders at the United Nations climate summit last month that America had done more under his watch to fight climate&nbsp;change than any other country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the EIA figures show that America's greenhouse gas emissions are now rising again after several years of decline during the recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chill Arctic temperatures of last year's polar vortex can shoulder much of the blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EIA said the rise in emissions was largely due to home heating because of the cold weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data also showed a 4.8% increase in the use of energy from coal, and a 10% fall in energy from natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissions were still 10% below 2005 levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest figures deepen doubts about whether America will meet its existing commitments for a 17% cut in emissions by 2020 without additional actions, or make the cuts required in the coming decades even deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last year, America was on track to meeting that goal, with emissions falling by more than 13% from 2005 to 2012. But that has shrunk to just 10% over the last year or so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the pressure is on to do more. World leaders have agreed they need to keep global average temperature from rising two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to prevent the worst consequences of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appetite for more ethical, sustainable investment seems to be on the rise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs should follow in the footsteps of the Rockeller family, Glasgow University and churches around the world by pulling their pension fund investments out of fossil fuels, according to Caroline Lucas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green party MP says the &pound;487m Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund should join the movement of hundreds of institutions worldwide who have already divested $50bn (&pound;31bn) from gas, coal and oil investments as a way of tackling climate&nbsp;change. A University of Oxford study says the campaign has grown faster than any previous divestment movements, including those on apartheid and tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas has written to Brian Donohoe, the chairman of the fund's trustees board, telling him that she is particularly concerned that the fund is contributing to global warming and of the economic risk to such assets if governments put in place &quot;effective climate regulation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MPs, parliament, should be demonstrating a positive way forward, it's incumbent to make sure our house is in order. It's not helpful if parliament is setting an example whereby we're not shifting our pension funds to sustainable sources and inadvertently potentially accelerating climate&nbsp;change,&quot; Lucas told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Glasgow became the first university in Europe to vote to pull its endowment out of fossil fuels. Students across the UK are lobbying universities to follow suit, including King's College London where campaigners met the vice-principal last week and the School of Oriental and African Studies where a decision is expected later this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas said the divestment campaign had benefited from comments by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who said earlier this month that the &quot;vast majority of reserves are unburnable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a strong economic reason [to divest]... That these pension funds might not be performing as well as they might appear, once you factor in the fact that the investment in fossil fuels could well be unrealisable if we take seriously the fact we need to be weaning ourselves off fossil fuels and stay below 2C warming,&quot; Lucas said, adding that she expected the call to attract cross-party support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donohoe, a Labour MP for Central Ayrshire, said he did not think fossil fuels were an investment the fund should avoid, or pull out of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to balance what individuals like she [Lucas] will say about certain investments... [with] the good of the fund. Now that doesn't mean to say we go down an amoral road, with tobacco or whatever else, clearly we don't. But fossil fuels is something else completely. I just don't think that's an issue in itself that we would want to avoid any form of investment [in].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that his personal view was that Lucas was a lone voice on the issue. &quot;I don't know what she's talking about frankly. If she's talking about stopping taking coal out of the earth, that would have to be universally applied, there'd be a closure to all coal-fired power stations. That would have quite a significant impact on Soctland and perhaps elsewhere. I don't know where she's coming from on this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund does not disclose how much of its value is invested in fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That review recommended closing the large-scale RET to new entrants, effectively freezing new investment by bringing the current target of 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2020 to around 16,000GWh, or else linking any increase to a pick up in electricity demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after fierce resistance from industry and concerted criticism of that review, the federal cabinet has asked the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement about the future of the program that would allow continued investment without fear of continued policy change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another meeting is scheduled for this week between Hunt and Macfarlane and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, Labor's resources spokesman, Gary Gray, and its environment spokesman, Mark Butler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Labor has indicated it is prepared to support exempting the aluminium industry from the scheme, which would bring the 41,000 target down to around 39,000 gigawatt hours, but appears unwilling to move very far beyond that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the CCA said its review &quot;will have regard to the role of the electricity sector in cost-effectively meeting the national emissions reductions goals that are in Australia's interest, in the period to 2020 and beyond&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the government's successful abolition of the carbon tax it has not yet managed to legislate &quot;Direct Action&quot; - its proposed alternative policy to meet Australia's 2020 emissions reduction target - and it has not yet set a post-2020 target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review will also take into account the absence of other climate policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the authority's view, key considerations for reviewing the RET are the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (both now and in the longer term), and the critical role that a decarbonised electricity sector will play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the absence of alternative policies to decarbonise Australia's electricity supply, severely curtailing the RET would risk stalling Australia's progress, at a time when climate&nbsp;change science makes it clear that rapid reductions in emissions are required,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority has previously recommended Australia's 2020 target be trebled to 15%. It said its new review would draw on its previous work as well as the Warburton review. It is seeking submissions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is already increasing the intensity and severity of bushfires in New South Wales and extending bushfire season by months, a report by the Climate Council has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic cost of fires such as those that devastated the state's Blue Mountains one year ago will triple by mid-century and the number of professional firefighters will need to double, the commission said, urging that carbon emissions be cut &quot;rapidly and deeply&quot; in order to reduce the risk of conditions becoming even hotter and drier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that 2013 was Australia's hottest year on record and last summer was the driest Sydney had experienced in nearly three decades. &quot;These conditions are driving up the likelihood of very high fire danger weather in the state,&quot; the report said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 local councils in the state announced the beginning of bushfire season before its official start in October, some as early as August, a month in which about 90 bushfires burned simultaneously and several properties were lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO of the Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, said that recent years had seen the introduction of a new category of fire warning. &quot;We saw in Black Saturday [in Victoria in 2009] a new fire weather warning, of 'catastrophic conditions', and we've seen that spread to South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. These are new types of fires,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the longer fire seasons meant that crucial hazard-reduction measures sometimes couldn't be carried out. &quot;There's a narrowing of time in which there's safe conditions to conduct hazard reduction, such as backburning and fuel clearing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said bushfire risk is exacerbated by a &quot;long-term drying trend&quot; as a result of decreasing rainfall in southeast Australia since the mid-1990s. The Bureau of Meteorology has predicted that the next three months will be &quot;drier than normal&quot;, reducing soil moisture and leading to a buildup of logs and forest debris that can be easily ignited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council, which was defunded by the Abbott government last year and resurrected with crowdsourced funding, directly addressed the link between climate&nbsp;change and bushfires - which prime minister Tony Abbott has described as &quot;complete hogwash&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says climate&nbsp;change plays a &quot;relatively small&quot; role in actually igniting bushfires, which are more likely to be deliberately lit or sparked by lightning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very hot, dry and windy days create very high bushfire risk. The most direct link between bushfires and climate&nbsp;change therefore comes from the relationship between the long-term trend towards a warmer climate due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions... and the incidence of very hot days,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Put simply, climate&nbsp;change is increasing the frequency and severity of very hot days and is driving up the likelihood of very high fire danger weather.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It notes: &quot;Asking if a weather event is 'caused' by climate&nbsp;change is the wrong question. All extreme weather events are now being influenced by climate&nbsp;change because they are occurring in a climate system that is hotter and moister than it was 50 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Guardian Australia reported in June that the environment department's official advice on extreme weather had been altered to remove mention of the link between climate&nbsp;change and events such as bushfires and heatwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the changes, a passage reading, &quot;There is a growing and robust body of evidence that climate&nbsp;change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,&quot; had been removed in favour of a general explanation of what extreme weather is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, was ridiculed last October for citing a Wikipedia entry to dismiss the link between bushfires and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKenzie said that bushfires had always been a part of Australian life, &quot;but what's happening is that climate&nbsp;change is worsening bushfire conditions, so there's a clear link between them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest IPCC assessment, released in March, found with &quot;high confidence&quot; that higher temperatures and drier conditions would lead to &quot;increased damages to ecosystems and settlements, economic losses and risks to human life from wildfires in most of southern Australia and many parts of New Zealand&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAURENS, Iowa -- Pocahontas is running out of students. Public school enrollment in this corn-blanketed county in northern Iowa has plummeted 32 percent over the past decade as the population steadily shrinks. Schools have merged, classes have combined, and sports teams have consolidated, wiping out generations of tradition and rivalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Joe Kramer, a school superintendent in the county, sifted through the cruel math of his latest casualty (a girls' varsity basketball program), he wore the weary look of an overbooked funeral director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a struggle for a community to make decisions like this,'' he said. ''It's so much a part of our identity.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours south, Dallas County faces a very different problem: It is running out of schools. With the population swelling, in what used to be farmland ringing Des Moines, enrollment in its largest district has doubled over the same 10 years. As soon as a gleaming new high school is completed, construction on another begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard conversations here, said Dave J. Wilkerson, the local superintendent, are telling parents that their children's schools have become overcrowded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I apologize that we will have to send your children off to a new, state-of-the-art school,'' he said. ''I would rather be dealing with this challenge than with what Pocahontas has.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa, the quintessence of heartland America, is undergoing an economic transformation that is challenging its rural character -- and, inevitably, its political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Iowans prepare to elect a new United States senator for the first time in three decades, the scale at which people and power have shifted from its rural towns to its urban areas is emerging as a potent but unpredictable undercurrent in the excruciatingly close race, offering opportunity and risk for both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's once ubiquitous farms are supporting fewer workers, the towns built around them are hemorrhaging younger residents, and a way of life eroding for decades is approaching a denouement. Farm fields are yielding to the new headquarters of banks, insurance companies and health care providers, whose rapid expansion is luring waves of Iowans to cities and suburbs, and contributing to the state's enviable 4.5&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[0/00]percent unemployment rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In jarring and telling tableaus, new housing subdivisions, with names like Stone Prairie and Walnut Creek Estates, are rising up in the Republican precincts west of Des Moines and downtown office buildings in the Democratic-leaning state capital are being remade into loft-style apartments. When researchers at Iowa State University studied population trends between 2000 and 2013, they found that the state's metropolitan areas had grown by 13.3 percent. The population of communities outside those urban areas fell by 3.6 percent, a gap that far outstrips the rest of the Midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those changes have turned Iowa's older, Republican precincts even redder and its younger, Democratic districts even bluer, while giving rise to suburbs whose politics can be harder to categorize -- a mixture of millennial generation religious conservatives, baby boomer libertarians and Generation X liberals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such places ''are not red state or a blue state. There are a lot of pastels in there,'' said David A. Yepsen, the director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University and former political writer for The Des Moines Register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Senate nominee, Joni Ernst, who is trying to become Iowa's first woman elected to Congress, has appealed to conservative rural voters, portraying herself as a hog-castrating, gun-firing daughter of Iowa's agricultural roots. The Democrat, Bruce Braley, a fourth-term representative, has embraced a more urban-friendly agenda, speaking out forcefully on climate&nbsp;change, advocating a higher minimum wage and backing same-sex marriage, which the Iowa Supreme Court legalized in 2009. In the campaign's highest-profile blunder, Mr. Braley was caught on tape belittling Iowa's senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, a Republican who would become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if his party won the majority, as ''a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school.'' He later apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potency of that urban-rural divide was captured in a Des Moines Register poll in September. It showed that Ms. Ernst had built a nearly 4-to-1 advantage over Mr. Braley among rural voters, which Ms. Ernst underscored in a debate by questioning whether Mr. Braley had forsworn his rural roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Braley shot back: ''I have not forgotten my rural values.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what the outcome, it is clear that Iowa, eternally satirized for monochromatic, pitchfork simplicity in ''American Gothic,'' is a swing state grappling with changes that defy long-held assumptions. Its farmers are emerging as leaders in sustainable energy, its rural towns are becoming magnets for Latinos, and its cities laboratories for high-tech start-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Tom Harkin, the Democrat whose retirement sparked this year's race, said the election would turn on which candidate acknowledged the new landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is this ideal of Iowa,'' he said. Those who have left its farmlands ''aren't too far removed from those small towns.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added, ''they know they are not going back there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural Collapse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stumpf is not going back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A generation ago, Treasure Chest, the consignment business his grandmother operates on the forlorn retail strip in Laurens, in western Pocahontas County, would have passed unthinkingly into his hands. Now business is agonizingly slow, and Mr. Stumpf, a 21-year-old film major at the University of Iowa, said small-town living ill suited him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is nothing for me here,'' he said, sitting in the store's stockroom as his grandmother, Millie Burnham, nodded in reluctant agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An air of diminishment, of something slipping away, surrounds them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everything is closing,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''School will, eventually,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurens, which flirted with a population of 1,800 in the 1960s, was down to 1,476 in 2000, then 1,258 in 2010. The story is similar across Iowa: Once-vibrant communities have been shattered in two waves, first by the farm crisis of the 1980s, then by technological improvements that encouraged far bigger farms and required far fewer farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 2011, Pocahontas's farming industry employed 764 people, about half as many as in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who stay are largely Republican. Susie Mayou, a 55-year-old conservative, described herself as heartsick that Democrats had carried Iowa in six of the last seven presidential elections. ''If Iowa gave power based on land ownership, the state would swing 180 degrees,'' she said. ''The city people push the agenda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That now includes people like the city-bound Mr. Stumpf. Despite his grandmother's Republicanism, he plans to vote for Mr. Braley, quoting from his campaign commercial attacking Ms. Ernst for opposing a federal minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downtown Revival</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known as Silicon Sixth: a stretch of Sixth Avenue in downtown Des Moines that houses about two dozen technology start-ups. A few blocks over, the Des Moines Building, an old office building, is undergoing a makeover into a 136-unit apartment building, complete with a dog-walking terrace. Up the street, the downtown's first full-service supermarket is under development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once sleepy core of Des Moines, known for its commuter-friendly 9-to-5 hours and drab overhead skywalk system, is taking on cosmopolitan hues. The population downtown has doubled over the past decade, and 1,500 new units of housing are planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Des Moines's home, Polk County -- where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 20,000 and President Obama's margin of victory widened between 2008 and 2012 -- is growing even more influential in statewide politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickey Davis, a 23-year-old musician, was so confident he would leave Iowa after college that on his arm he tattooed the corporate emblem of Travelers Insurance Company, a mainstay of downtown Des Moines, to take a bit of the state with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is now the program manager at the Des Moines Social Club, a hive of cultural activity inside the Art Deco quarters of an erstwhile firehouse, which hosts operas, poetry readings, bands, art exhibits and yoga classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Des Moines,'' he said over lunch, ''is actually a happening place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanic Growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Pete Rodriguez navigated his white Toyota sedan down Main Street, jabbing his finger at the passing houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Hispanics live there,'' he said of a white ranch. ''That's a Hispanic house,'' he said of a beige Victorian. The phrase echoed like a soundtrack. Hispanic house. Hispanic house. Hispanic house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa, with its 92 percent white population, remains a place where diversity seems oxymoronic, ''so white that you almost need special glasses to pick the people out from the snow banks,'' Wade Rathke, the founder of Acorn, the social activist group, wrote in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the city of Denison, in far western Iowa, decades of stereotypes are falling away, revealing corners of the state where Latino immigrants are remaking the landscape. Here, where meatpacking plants crave low-wage workers, Hispanics make up 42 percent of the population, more than twice as much as a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These migrant towns now pepper the state: West Liberty, Storm Lake, Muscatine and Marshalltown. State data shows that the 168,000 Latinos in Iowa are now its largest minority, 6 percent of the population, and the figure is expected to surge because Latinos are significantly younger than their white neighbors and have far higher birthrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Denison school system is now recruiting Spanish-language teachers. The Walmart Supercenter has dedicated an aisle to ''Hispanic food.'' The City Council has its first Latino member, Mr. Rodriguez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for now, the power of the Latino vote is more potential than reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latinos of Denison have a dismal record of casting ballots. Not long ago, the mayor, Brad Bonner, cracked open a binder containing the city's voting rolls in search of Hispanic names. ''There were 12 of them,'' he said. ''They don't vote.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Ritchie, a community activist, chose a coffee shop in the city's quaint downtown to explain why. Inside, Denison's aging power brokers -- about 15 bankers, lawyers and farmers -- held their weekly breakfast meeting over slices of egg, sausage and Velveeta casserole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were all white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''See?'' asked Ms. Ritchie, a 41-year-old Hispanic and an Army veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics in Denison, she said, ''are afraid of the white power structure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have participated in the past have not always been heartened by the results. Vicenta Cardenas, 43, who crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico but is now a citizen, registered to vote in time for the 2008 general election, casting a ballot for Mr. Obama. She did the same in 2012. They were votes, she believed, to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty has not come. ''Personally, I feel Obama tricked Latinos,'' she said, sitting at her kitchen table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if she intended to vote this year, Ms. Cardenas shrugged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflicted Farmers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign commercial opens with a rural tableau of windmills and rows of soybeans. ''I grew up walking beans on our family farm,'' Ms. Ernst says. The ad concludes with an appeal to Iowa's of-the-land pride, suggesting the triumph of entrepreneurial farmers over the bureaucracy of Washington. ''I'll take our values there,'' she says of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Iowa's rural values, conflicted by farmers' deepening reliance on government and colored by a growing investment in the green economy, are no longer reflexively Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crosscurrents are on display at Campbell Grain Farms in Clinton County, near Iowa's eastern border. Its owner, Dennis Campbell, a sixth-generation soybean and corn farmer, acknowledges that he is a walking contradiction: both a victim of an overreaching federal government and a poster child for the benefits of federal intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He walked up to a gas tank on his property, a totem, he said, of federal rules run amok. To cut down on fuel deliveries -- reducing costs and carbon emissions -- he bought a 10,000-gallon behemoth. But for one that size, the government mandates a double-walled model, to prevent leaks. That cost him tens of thousands of dollars extra, an expense avoided by neighboring farmers who stick with tanks that are smaller, older and riskier. ''I'm being penalized by the government,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a few feet away, he showed off a wall of 256 solar panels on the roof of his shed that will generate enough electricity to power his farm. It is a money-saving technology whose economics, he conceded, work only because of some $80,000 worth of tax credits from the same federal government that insisted he buy the pricier gas tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am talking out of both sides of my mouth,'' said Mr. Campbell, who intends to support Ms. Ernst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa farmers received more than $1&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[0/00]billion in federal aid and subsidies in 2012, according to the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation.. It is no wonder that the most heated policy debate in the Senate race here is over a federal measure, coveted by farmers, that guarantees a market for corn-based ethanol by requiring energy companies to blend billions of gallons of the biofuel with gasoline for cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Ernst, a Tea Party favorite, declared herself philosophically opposed to rule, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard. That prompted a series of attacks from Mr. Braley, and ever-firmer assurances from Ms. Ernst that she would nonetheless fight to protect the fuel measure. The Iowa Corn Growers Association PAC was not satisfied: In a move that stung Ms. Ernst's campaign, it endorsed Mr. Braley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar dissonance has surrounded the issue of climate&nbsp;change. Ms. Ernst, skeptical about the role of human activity in global warming, is wary of any government mandates to cut carbon emissions. Mr. Braley is a proponent of government measures to curb climate&nbsp;change, such as strict fuel efficiency requirements for carmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the candidates debate the urgency of action, Iowa farmers have reached their own conclusion about sustainable energy: It is profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold and Virginia Olson, farmers in Calhoun County, have no computer in their home. But they do have a windmill on their farm. Gamesa, an energy company, pays them $6,000 a year for allowing the company to use the family's land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Seeking constructive dialogue on the merits and limits of clean, efficient lighting. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was quite a bit of pushback after The Times ran &quot;The Problem with Energy Efficiency,&quot; an Op-Ed article by Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger arguing that LED lighting, while deservedly resulting in a Nobel Prize for inventors of the underlying technology, was not an energy panacea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below I'm posting some more criticism, from four researchers focused on energy innovation and climate policy:&nbsp;In&ecirc;s Azevedo, an engineer and public policy analyst at Carnegie Mellon University, Kenneth Gillingham, an economist at Yale, David Rapson, an economist at the University of California, Davis, and Gernot Wagner, lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My goal is to find &quot;room for agreement&quot; on ways to make sure the world gets the most value out of this kind of bright idea with the fewest regrets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One issue, for me, is that an environment-focused debate centered on kilowatt-hours and greenhouse gas emissions misses the priceless societal value of wider access to cleaner, brighter lighting. My favorite part of the &quot;sustainable energy for all&quot; speech given periodically by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is his recollection of his youth studying by lamp or candle light:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I studied at night by a dim and smoky oil lamp.<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;&#8232;</SPAN> Only when I prepared for examinations was I allowed to use a candle. Candles were considered too expensive to use for ordinary homework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine how many future leaders now have their books illuminated by LED lights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarifying how much energy &quot;rebound&quot; (expanded energy demand) results from access to more efficient technologies is important, of course. David Owen, the New Yorker writer, dug in on this helpfully in &quot;The Conundrum.&quot; I see the Breakthrough Institute, founded by Shellenberger and Nordhaus after they wrote &quot;The Death of Environmentalism,&quot; as a helpful prod to conventional wisdom on many issues related to technology and the environment. But like many players in this fraught arena, they sometimes frame their positions in ways that create more heat than light (sorry).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd be surprised if Azevedo, Gillingham, Rapson and Wagner completely disagreed with what I see as the most important point in the Op-Ed, which is that the world will need more clean energy in coming decades with or without more efficiency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people in the world, still struggling to achieve modern living standards, need to consume more energy, not less. Cheap LED and other more efficient energy technologies will be overwhelmingly positive for people and economies all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But LED and other ultraefficient lighting technologies are unlikely to reduce global energy consumption or reduce carbon emissions. If we are to make a serious dent in carbon emissions, there is no escaping the need to shift to cleaner sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read on for their fresh critique or click here for the piece as a downloadable pdf file with a graphic and references. I encourage the authors and Shellenberger and Nordhaus to engage with each other and circle back with a set of points of agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is energy efficiency a good thing even with rebound?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By In&ecirc;s Azevedo, Kenneth Gillingham, David Rapson, and Gernot Wagner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lighting is critical to our livelihoods. Humans have used lighting technology since long before industrialization. For many centuries, this lighting was extremely inefficient, with over 95% of the energy consumed wasted as heat. Recently, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for their remarkable contributions towards highly efficient light emitting diode (LED) technology. A day later, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus reignited a long standing debate with an Op-Ed in The New York Times claiming that these developments are not likely to save energy and instead may backfire. (The Times has since corrected a crucial point of the article, and it has published three letters to the editor, including one by a subset of co-authors here.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence for these claims, Shellenberger and Nordhaus cite research that observes the vast improvements in the efficiency of lighting over the past two centuries having resulted in &quot;more and more of the planet [being] dotted with clusters of lights.&quot; They take this as evidence of how newer and ever more efficient lighting technologies have led to demand increases and, thus, have &quot;led to more overall energy consumption.&quot; Further, they refer to &quot;recent estimates and case studies&quot; that suggest &quot;energy-saving technologies may backfire, meaning that increased energy consumption associated with lower energy costs because of higher efficiency may in fact result in higher energy consumption than there would have been without those technologies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off, yes, it is likely that many efficiency improvements are associated with some rebound effect. It's been with us forever, and it's been known for over a century. More efficient lighting leads to people using more light. Key here is &quot;leads to.&quot; Causality matters. More on that in a minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, a quick look at the actual technology in question. It turns out the technology developments for LED lighting are, in fact, much greater than previous advances in lighting. Figure 1 [ see the pdf ] shows the dramatic pace of technology change in LED efficacy. The Nobel Prize was well-deserved: LEDs provide a major energy-saving innovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the claim that this efficiency improvement will only lead to more energy use? This claim is simply not justified. Noting that lighting dots the globe at night today when it did not in the 19th century may be confounding correlation with causation. The world is also much wealthier today and the service provided by light from electricity is very different than candlelight. Perhaps earlier lighting would have dotted the globe at night in 1850 too had we been as wealthy as today and had consistent lighting. We cannot say without looking at the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence we have is quite clear. Shellenberger and Nordhaus say &quot;The I.E.A. and I.P.C.C. estimate that the rebound could be over 50 percent globally,&quot; and they then proceed to talk about &quot;backfire,&quot; a rebound effect of over 100 percent. That's quite a jump from 50 to 100. What's missing here is that most studies, including the IEA's and their own(!), take 60% as an upper bound. The IPCC summarizes the evidence as thus:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A comprehensive review of 500 studies suggests that direct rebounds are likely to be over 10% and could be considerably higher (i.e., 10% less savings than the projected saving from engineering principles). Other reviews have shown larger ranges with Thomas and Azevedo (Thomas and Azevedo, 2013) suggesting between 0 and 60%. For household-efficiency measures, the majority of studies show rebounds in developed countries in the region of 20-45% (the sum of direct and indirect rebound effects), meaning that efficiency measures achieve 65-80% of their original purposes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have each performed our own detailed surveys of the literature (Azevedo 2014; Thomas &amp; Azevedo, 2013; Gillingham et al. 2013; Gillingham et al. 2014) and largely agree with these statements from the I.P.C.C. The bottom-line: the evidence for a &quot;backfire&quot; is weak. The rebound effect is clearly there, but first it's generally relatively small-especially in developed countries. Perhaps most importantly, where it does exist-and it does-it's good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy inefficiency can't be good. That doesn't yet mean that efficiency alone is sufficient. Every economist worth his or her degree would conclude that we need a price on carbon or a similar instrument. Bonus fact: there's no direct rebound effect with pricing mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Nobel Committee notes in its press release: &quot;The LED lamp holds great promise for increasing the quality of life for over 1.5 billion people around the world who lack access to electricity grids.&quot; In short, and as two of us say in a shorter letter to the editor, LEDs alone clearly won't solve global warming, nor will they solve global poverty. But they are a step in the right direction for both. Thank you, Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura, and to the Nobel Committee for recognizing their work.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of epidemiology has expanded dramatically over the past 150 years, from its origins seeking to understand the causes of epidemic diseases, through the role of specific risk factors in non-communicable diseases, to the big questions facing humanity, and in some cases threatening its very survival. Tony McMichael, who has died aged 71 after suffering from pneumonia, pioneered this third strand, showing how epidemiological techniques could be applied to global environmental change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, by the 1980s, he had long been concerned about what he termed &quot;planetary overload&quot; (later the title of one of his bestselling books), whereby the Earth is no longer able to sustain its expanding population with its increasing desire to consume natural resources and degrade the environment, it was not obvious how the debate could be shifted from speculation to empirical evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony developed conceptual models of the global ecosystem, refined the methods needed to understand it and analysed an array of data to quantify the effects on human health of climate&nbsp;change that many suspected but that could not be measured. These included the impact of changes in the seasonal variation of deaths among older people in temperate climates and the distribution of insect vectors of diseases, such as Ross River virus in his native Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this understanding of the complex links between global ecology and human health involved various academic institutions, Tony was the most senior health expert in the team and, by virtue of his personality, powers of persuasion and, especially, his status in epidemiology, he was able to legitimise this topic as a field of research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was an obvious choice to chair the committee assessing health risks for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change between 1993 and 1996, during which time he moved to the UK, becoming professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994. In 2001 he returned to Australia to take over as head of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University in Canberra. There, he added greatly to understanding of the interaction between climate and infectious disease, researching topics such as the association between the El Nino phenomenon and the pattern of dengue fever in Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This research informed the 2013 report of the World Health Organisation's tropical diseases research programme on the combined climatic, environmental, agricultural and nutritional influences on the emergence of infectious disease, which he chaired after stepping down as director of the centre in Canberra in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Tony's arguments were based on solid research, he also recognised that publications in peer-reviewed journals, of which he published more than 300, would not lead to action. He was on the board of several NGOs, was an advocate for action on climate and health and, just before his death, was a lead author of an open letter to the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, calling for climate&nbsp;change and health to be placed on the G20 agenda. Given the hostility to such a move among the few people who, for whatever reason, still refuse to accept the international consensus on the causes of climate&nbsp;change, he was amused when one accused him of being a scurrilous fascist, and another, a socialist lackey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of David McMichael, an architect, and Catherine Padman, Tony excelled at St Peter's college, an Anglican boys' school. Although there was no tradition of medicine in the family, he moved seamlessly to the medical school of the University of Adelaide. Even at that stage, his curiosity about the world was apparent and, in those days before low-cost international flights, he took slow boats to India - where his time in a leper colony exposed him to the unequal distribution of resources on this planet and the discrimination experienced by some of its most vulnerable inhabitants - and, later, to Papua New Guinea, where he met Judith Healy, whom he married in 1967, the year he graduated. He then took a year away from medicine to become president of the National Union of Australian University Students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a brief period in general practice, Tony enrolled as the first PhD student in epidemiology at Monash University, Melbourne, graduating in 1972. Correspondence with the microbiologist turned global health ecologist Rene Dubos led Tony to postdoctoral work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he demonstrated the importance of the &quot;healthy worker effect&quot;, whereby those who are exposed to hazards at work may, paradoxically, have better outcomes than the general population, either because they are selected for employment, or because they self-select into certain occupations, on account of their better initial health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both there, and after his return to Australia, at the division of human nutrition at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and later as the first holder of the foundation chair of occupational and environmental health at the University of Adelaide in 1986, Tony established his reputation as a first-class epidemiologist, generating knowledge on a diverse range of topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, the question of whether exposure to lead, then widespread in paints and water pipes, affected children's neurological development, remained unanswered. Tony led a study in Port Pirie, South Australia, home to the largest lead smelter in the southern hemisphere. He showed that exposure to lead varied greatly within the community, depending not only on the proximity of the child's home to the smelter but the concentration of lead in house dust and soil. The children were followed up with detailed developmental assessments until the age of 12. The results provided definitive evidence of the dangers of lead and were widely cited in the campaign to remove it from petrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony also chaired a working party for the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council that produced a crucial report on passive smoking, frequently cited in the campaign to ban smoking in public places. These achievements alone would have guaranteed him a place in the epidemiological hall of fame. However, it was his achievements from the late 1980s onwards for which he will be best remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony received many awards, among them appointment as an officer of the Order of Australia and election to the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the US National Academy of Sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is survived by Judith, a health policy researcher at the Australian National University, their two daughters, Anna and Celia, and his brothers, Philip and Robert. A sister, Alison, predeceased him.</SPAN></P>

These achievements alone would have guaranteed him a place in the epidemiological hall of fame. However, it was his achievements from the late 1980s onwards for which he will be best remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony received many awards, among them appointment as an officer of the Order of Australia and election to the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the US National Academy of Sciences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Tom Steyer and seven campaign advisers sat in a small conference room in Coral Gables, Fla., trying to figure out how to save the world. Steyer, who is 57, has a fortune of roughly $1.5 billion, and his advisers were among the most talented political operatives in the United States. Steyer is especially concerned about climate&nbsp;change, and his immediate goal, the object of discussion that day, was to replace the sitting governor of Florida, Rick Scott, a Republican who has questioned the very existence of anthropogenic climate&nbsp;change, with Charlie Crist, the previous governor, whose environmental views hew more closely to Steyer's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead Florida strategist, Nick Baldick, was running through the campaign numbers. ''There's a problem here,'' he said, brandishing a printout. Two bars, blue and red, were labeled ''Total Raised,'' and the red Republican bar was notably longer. ''It's just ugly,'' Baldick said, with a shake of his head: ''$74 million to Crist's $24 million. And they have $38 million cash on hand to his $15 million.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spring, when Crist was riding a double-digit lead, Florida looked like a safe bet, but then Scott unleashed an $18 million ad campaign against Crist, painting him as a hack careerist who loves Obamacare and lays off teachers. Not only had Crist's lead vanished, now he was losing in the key swing district of Tampa, winning by too little in Democrat-friendly West Palm and losing by too much in Republican-leaning Fort Myers. And as Baldick's numbers showed, neither the state Democratic Party nor Crist could match the barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldick is stocky and bald in the way that suggests he should always have a cigar jutting from his mouth. He is known in Democratic politics for his irascibility. It's part act -- political consultants make their trade in bad news -- but he was truly annoyed this morning, he told me, largely because I was present at the meeting. Steyer and his communications team had invited me into their inner sanctum partly to make a point, namely that Steyer was more transparent than his rival powers, the conservative billionaire Koch brothers. Baldick saw it as a needless risk. In his decades of experience (in the Clinton, Gore and Edwards presidential campaigns, to name a few), reporters were not invited into sensitive strategy sessions like this one. It wasn't done and shouldn't be done, he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer, though, saw visibility as part of the job. He made his money as the founder of a successful hedge fund called Farallon Capital Management and so had spent most of his adult life wading through prospectuses and annual reports. He seemed enthralled and energized by his new course of study in domestic politics, with its incongruent mix of idealism and cynicism. This was democracy in action, real people making real change, not just mysterious figures behind closed doors. Tall, with grayish blond hair and shaggy sideburns, Steyer was in constant motion: his arms waving, his hands slicing the air, his tie -- always the same stiff, scotch plaid -- swaying to and fro as he spoke. In talking about the political offshoots of his money, he sometimes had the air of a new father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer's long-term goal was to build an organization called NextGen Climate Action, which could mirror and oppose the rival private interests who devoted their own fortunes to blocking any action on climate&nbsp;change. Chief among those rivals were Charles and David Koch, the brothers who run Koch Industries. Steyer was especially interested in enacting a cap-and-trade system, which would allow companies to buy or sell emission rights under a strict state or federal limit. The Koch brothers, meanwhile, have worked hard to prevent, among many other government interventions, the adoption of a cap-and-trade system, which they view as the ultimate in reckless government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Steyer didn't step in as a counterweight, he reasoned, no one else would; after all, no one else had so far. Steyer pledged to spend at least $50 million of his own fortune this election season by way of NextGen on behalf of Democrats or, perhaps more accurate, against Republicans, in Florida and six other states: Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Most of the races were for the Senate, which Republicans are in a position to retake this fall. But the race that was closest to Steyer's heart was here, in the state ''most vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change,'' as he put it; a crucial swing state where the Koch brothers had already spent millions to establish a political presence. Charlie Crist himself journeyed to NextGen's San Francisco headquarters in June, to tell Steyer and many of these same strategists about sea-level rise in Miami, its troubling effects on drinking water and flood insurance and about the many ways in which he differed from Rick Scott. (''There couldn't be a clearer choice,'' Crist told me later. ''I'm, like, the opposite of this guy.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist had been a Republican for most of his long career in Florida politics -- as a state senator in 1992, as an education commissioner, as an attorney general -- but after a single term as governor, during which he later claimed to have become increasingly alienated from a party that he described as ''anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-minority, anti-gay, anti-education, anti-environment,'' he sought an independent U.S. Senate seat instead. He lost that bid to Marco Rubio, and in 2012 he announced (via Twitter) that he had registered as a Democrat. In November 2013 after an encouraging meeting with Steyer, he announced that he would seek the governor's seat again. In his last turn as governor, Crist took climate&nbsp;change seriously; he pushed through a law that authorized the state's Department of Environmental Protection to develop a cap-and-trade system. Scott and the Legislature dismantled the law, and Scott redirected the agency instead to ''ensure that Florida leads the nation in new partnerships between government and industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the cramped conference table, Baldick rattled off more news, both good and bad. A series of recent polls found that both candidates were extremely unlikable. (''Crist and Scott Could Make History by Being So Unpopular in Florida'' was the headline of one recent report at FiveThirtyEight.com.) Baldick said this could actually be a positive development. ''Both of them are not liked,'' he explained, but ''if you think people are going to show up because they hate, not love -- I do -- there's more people who hate Scott.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer leaned back in contemplation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You think that's what gets people to vote?'' he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Oh yeah, hate, fear --''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The negative emotions,'' Steyer said, radiating subtle disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldick gave him a look. ''You can go with love,'' he said, to which Steyer, playing along, quickly replied, ''We're from California, Nick.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were laughs all around. Baldick moved on to the results from a poll the team conducted of Hispanic voters, a demographic whose turnout on Election Day was a central element of the NextGen strategy. The good news was that environmental messaging did seem to make Hispanic voters turn away from Scott. The bad news was that this messaging made them no likelier to actually vote. The solution, Baldick informed Steyer, was to tie environmental issues to broader themes that are proven to bring voters to the polls, starting with the attack line -- a shopworn one, but one that worked well against Mitt Romney in 2012 -- that Scott is ''not for you.'' Baldick ticked off ways to bolster that pitch: ''He cut education to pay for corporate tax cuts, he let polluters pollute the Everglades. . . .''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll did contain some welcome news about another group vital to Crist's chances: Youth voters said they would respond directly to the climate issue by coming out to vote. ''Not only do they understand it, but it impacts them,'' Baldick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer lit up. ''Nick, if this really works, we should'' -- he waggled his hands above his ears in the universal gesture of going nuts -- ''as opposed to trying harder on something that's not working.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcomers to politics, especially baby boomers, are always excited about voters who are the same age as their children. Before the team could get into the nuances of motivating young people, an aide came in to say that Crist himself had just shown up for a scheduled session with Steyer. I imagined this meant our meeting was over; onetime governors are conditioned to expect that others will drop everything when they arrive. But Steyer wanted to hear more about the youth vote. Charlie Crist would have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the winter of 2000, just as John McCain and George W. Bush were entering a pivotal series of Republican primaries, a mysterious new campaign ad appeared on television stations in New York, Ohio and California. The ad showed McCain's disembodied head floating over belching smokestacks as a narrator intoned about votes McCain had made against solar and renewable-energy incentives -- policies that in reality he had supported. The ad was sponsored by a group called Republicans for Clean Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial backers behind Republicans for Clean Air were the Texas billionaires Charles and Sam Wyly. They had a history of supporting Bush, but they were also heavily invested in a company seeking government-induced increases in alternative-energy production. The revelation that a single Texas family could so easily insert itself into the political process set off a round of frenzied indignation, and after McCain's loss, it became crucial fodder for his effort to reform the national campaign-finance system. In 2002, along with a Democratic senator, Russell D. Feingold, he helped push a bill through Congress that ranked alongside some of the most sweeping efforts to contain ''special interest'' money in American history: the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned corporate contributions to candidates; the Smith-Connally Act of 1943, which prohibited union donations to candidates; and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which placed strict limits on what individuals could give to parties and campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before 2002, parties could accept unlimited donations from individuals or groups (corporations, labor unions, etc.) so long as they devoted the funds -- so-called ''soft money'' -- to the amorphous act of ''party building.'' The McCain-Feingold law, as it came to be known, banned soft-money contributions, and it also prohibited political groups that operate outside the regulated system and its donation limits -- like the Wylys and their Republicans for Clean Air -- from running ''issue ads'' that appear to help or hurt a candidate close to an election. It implemented tough fines and even prison terms for those who illegally coordinated with the official campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court effectively blew apart the McCain-Feingold restrictions on outside groups and their use of corporate and labor money in elections. That same year, a related ruling from a lower court made it easier for wealthy individuals to finance those groups to the bottom of their bank accounts if they so chose. What followed has been the most unbridled spending in elections since before Watergate. In 2000, outside groups spent $52 million on campaigns, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By 2012, that number had increased to $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was a massive power shift, from the party bosses to the rich individuals who ran the super PACs (as most of these new organizations came to be called). Almost overnight, traditional party functions -- running TV commercials, setting up field operations, maintaining voter databases, even recruiting candidates -- were being supplanted by outside groups. And the shift was partly because of one element of McCain-Feingold that remains: the ban on giving unlimited soft money to parties. In the party universe, rich players like the Wylys, Tom Steyer or the Kochs were but single planets among many. The party bosses had to balance their interests against those who brought just as much to the table in the form of money or votes. A party platform has to account for both the interests of the oil industry and those of the ethanol industry; those of the casino industry and those of the anti-gambling religious right; those of Wall Street and those of labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the advent of Citizens United, any players with the wherewithal, and there are surprisingly many of them, can start what are in essence their own political parties, built around pet causes or industries and backing politicians uniquely answerable to them. No longer do they have to buy into the system. Instead, they buy their own pieces of it outright, to use as they see fit. ''Suddenly, we privatized politics,'' says Trevor Potter, an election lawyer who helped draft the McCain-Feingold law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we have Michael Bloomberg, who has committed to spending $50 million to support gun-control legislation; his Independence USA PAC, meanwhile, is spending $25 million this fall to elect ''centrists.'' We have the TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his group Ending Spending, which has spent roughly $10 million so far this year to elect fiscal conservatives to Congress, an effort that has drawn support from the billionaire hedge-fund executive Paul E. Singer, who has also devoted tens of millions to Republican candidates who share his views on Israel. We have Mark Zuckerberg and his FWD.us, with a budget of about $50 million to push an immigration overhaul. In 2014, as of early October, when the campaigns had yet to do their big final pushes, overall spending was already more than $444 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Roughly $231 million was from the parties and their congressional committees, the rest from outside spending. The biggest chunk of that by far came from super PACs -- more than $196 million. Looking at those numbers, it's not hard to understand why Crist was willing to wait outside a conference room in Coral Gables for Steyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer, with his $50 million pledge, is one of the most deep-pocketed political arrivistes. But he has a long way to go to catch up with the Koch brothers, whose own group, Americans for Prosperity, already has political operations in every state that Steyer is contesting, along with 28 others. The group says it will spend at least $125 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of Americans for Prosperity is Tim Phillips. Tall and fit at 50, Phillips holds forth with evident delight, betraying the slight accent of his native South Carolina, on whatever topic is at hand. (A somewhat larger than usual breakfast, for instance, earns an emphatic ''I'm in awe of our country at this moment.'') After attending Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Phillips worked on several congressional races before starting a consulting firm with the Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed. The Kochs hired Phillips in 2005 to make Americans for Prosperity into a force that could defeat liberalism and elect true free-market conservatives -- ones who understood that when business gets hurt, people lose jobs and the country suffers -- and make them pay a price if they strayed. (David Koch is the chairman of the group's foundation, while Charles Koch has no formal role.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity started small, with an effort in Charles Koch's home state of Kansas to defeat a proposed tax increase; it then moved on to spearhead a quixotic fight against the teachers' union over pay in Wisconsin. As recently as 2008, the group's activities were negligible, and it had just $7 million in its operating budget, according to its Internal Revenue Service filing. But after Citizens United, donations poured in. In 2012, it raised $115 million. It is impossible to know the identities of the donors, though the group's annual closed-door conferences are regularly attended by many of the biggest conservative donors in the country, including the hedge-fund executive Foster Friess and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does the money go? Americans for Prosperity obviously spends a lot on television, but it also maintains offices in 35 states with 600 paid staff members. The group funds phone banks, big-ticket events and many other details like beer cozies and water bottles. Its biggest chapter is in Florida, where its 50 paid staff members work out of 10 offices and constitute a year-round organization that rivals that of the state Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The A.F.P. offices are in the same brick corporate campus in Arlington, Va., that housed George W. Bush's campaign in 2004. The narrow white hallways and gray cubicles would be somewhat grim if not for Phillips's insistence that each staff member place an image of something he or she holds dear on their nameplates (a pinup of the actress Jane Russell, the logo of the University of Virginia or, on Phillips's own door, a photo of the band U2, with his own head pasted atop Bono's body). A.F.P. operates at such a low hum that it would have been hard to guess, at the moment I was visiting, how many different operations its staff members were overseeing simultaneously. There was a $1 million ad buy criticizing the Democrat Mark Begich in Alaska, as well as a new ad campaign against Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado. There was a series of rallies attacking the Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley in Iowa and a door-knocking campaign for Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the balloon. Phillips pointed to a photograph on the wall, depicting a scene from an event Americans for Prosperity held in Bozeman, Mont., in 2009: a 70-foot balloon awaiting takeoff. ''We called it the 'Cost of Hot Air,' '' Phillips said. At the time, A.F.P. was trying to counter the movement to establish a cap-and-trade system. Many Republicans, including John McCain, supported such a system, and a bipartisan implementation of it seemed likely upon Obama's election. A.F.P.'s balloon was part of a national tour to block it. ''We put on the side of the balloon: 'Cap and trade means: higher taxes, lost jobs, less freedom' -- six words.'' It made dozens of trips, including one over Al Gore's house in Tennessee. All the while, Americans for Prosperity, joined by other conservative groups, directed ads and phone calls pressuring lawmakers to vote against the major cap-and-trade bill when it came up for a vote in 2009; Phillips helped to rebrand the bill more negatively as ''cap and tax.'' It died in the Senate, and support for cap-and-trade among Republican officeholders fell to a negligible level, where it remains today. ''I rode more hot-air balloons in that year-and-a-half period than I ever want to ride again,'' Phillips said. ''I do not like hot-air balloons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the group's efforts on behalf of Scott, Phillips says, the most important factor is the growth of the volunteer base of Americans for Prosperity, which it now numbers into the tens of thousands. The first lesson of party politics is that winning elections means getting out the vote, and getting out the vote means signing up volunteers. Phillips spends a lot of time thinking about what will keep them happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given their negatives, neither Scott nor Crist was going to win by sweeping new converts off their feet. Big spending on television was certainly threatening to make a difference for Scott. But if Crist could catch up on TV, with Steyer's help, the election was going to be decided by which side did a better job of identifying new sympathetic voters and then prodding them out to the polls. It required the hard work of knocking on doors, which can be especially brutal under the hot Florida sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement is independent of the party, which is the way Phillips wants it. When Rick Scott said he would support an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, Americans for Prosperity let him know about its displeasure through a deluge of phone calls and letters and even a protest at the State Capitol. Scott ultimately made no effort to push it through the Legislature, many of whose Republican members have been supported by the group as well. ''I think he started hearing from some other voices, A.F.P. and some of the other organizations,'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, had said, ''and I think they sort of superseded what was going on in his own staff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips said the group's volunteers would have it no other way. ''They have to feel like the organization is genuinely a principled outfit,'' he said. ''If they think you're just an appendage of the party, they can go to the party. Why do they need you?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in August, Kat Taylor, who has been married to Tom Steyer for 28 years, offered to show me around TomKat Ranch, the family's 1,800-acre spread on the central California coast, and talk about how the family had become involved in climate politics. Taylor, 56, is slight yet muscular, with short and wavy gray hair and a tattoo of a flowering vine around her impressive biceps. She spends part of her week overseeing the ranch, and its 130 head of grass-fed cattle, but most of her time is spent running the community bank that she and Steyer founded in 2007, when all four of their children were older and more independent. Taylor supported Steyer in his latest political mission, she said, even after he told her, ''This is going to give us a lot more visibility, and it won't all be positive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she was bothered by the questioning of his motives and the occasional charges of hypocrisy from the press and his political enemies. Yes, she patiently explained to me, Steyer's firm made many millions from investments in coal mines and coal-fired power plants in Asia and Australia, as it had in all sorts of other industries. But that was long before he came to believe that the fate of the planet depended upon curbing carbon emissions, and he has since divested his personal portfolio of any fossil-fuel-related investments. Taylor had also learned to deflect the inevitable questions about whether he was preparing his own run for office. (''I don't think he thinks that's the right priority right now,'' she said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer has been involved in politics for years. He was a major fund-raiser for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and in 2006 worked closely with Chris Lehane, a longtime Democratic strategist, to defeat a Republican effort to change California's electoral-college rules. (Lehane has been acting as Steyer's personal political strategist ever since.) In 2012, though, Steyer read an essay in Rolling Stone (''Global Warming's Terrifying New Math''), in which Bill McKibben, the writer and climate activist, suggested that fossil-fuel interests had too much money at stake to let the political system do anything about carbon emissions. The only alternative, McKibben wrote, was a mass movement, and the only way to start a mass movement was to articulate a consistent, fact-based moral argument for change. At that moment, Taylor said, ''Tom realized that the climate threat was near, present, imminent, massive -- and aggravates every other crisis, whether it's hunger or civil rights.'' He had to do something different. So a few months later he and Taylor invited McKibben to the ranch for a war council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were in the ranch's spartan barn house when Taylor recounted this. The council had been right there, beneath the reclaimed wood beams. Lehane was there, and so was John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff who would later join the Obama White House as an adviser. They all considered various ways to act. They agreed, finally, that Steyer should try a few experiments, but should come out with particular force against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would link oil-rich Canadian sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. In March 2013, Steyer sent a letter to Stephen Lynch, a Democratic congressman and pipeline supporter who was seeking the Senate seat left vacant by John Kerry when he became secretary of state. The letter demanded that Lynch renounce his support for Keystone by ''high noon Friday'' or face aggressive opposition. It was an obvious stunt, but it got attention. Lynch declared that ''billionaires won't shove me around''; Steyer responded by providing Lynch's primary opponent, Ed Markey, an anti-Keystone congressman, with nearly $700,000 in campaign support. Markey, who said he did not want Steyer's help, won handily. In Virginia that same year, Steyer bought $8 million in television ads and mailings to highlight the climate-change skepticism of the Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. The Democrat, Terry McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic Party, won by 2.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much credit Steyer can claim in either of these victories is debatable. But by early 2014, just about every Democrat considering a competitive run this year, including Charlie Crist, had made a pilgrimage to see Steyer in San Francisco. And in April, the State Department announced it would delay its decision on Keystone XL pending an analysis of expected legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a victory, but it did not necessarily echo the consistent, moral argument of McKibben's initial call. As we spoke, NextGen was spending about $100,000 to build and operate a wooden Noah's Ark on wheels that it would drive around the state, taunting Scott for his failure to address climate&nbsp;change. It was also spending $2 million on an ad campaign that blamed Scott for the failure of Duke Energy, a major Scott contributor, to upgrade one nuclear power plant and build another, for which it had to increase utility fees, despite the fact that Scott had no direct say over this decision. Even beyond the publicity stunts and elisions of fact, NextGen's campaign largess was itself a capitulation to the post-Citizens United world. Steyer was applying pressure to the political system in a way no average American could. It seemed undemocratic. But Steyer saw it as simple pragmatism; the other side was ''playing multiples,'' he said, and he had to operate ''in the real world the way the real world works.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our tour wound down in front of a long, waist-high granite pool filled with koi, the remains of an unsuccessful attempt at sustainable fish farming that now doubled as a huge outdoor dining table. As we stood beside it, Taylor told me about charts she had seen, apparently online, placing Steyer at the center of a web of liberal interests: a conservative answer to the many liberal diagrams of ''The Kochtopus.'' The connections were all real, or at least many of them were. That was the whole point of playing multiples. But the comparison seemed to bother her. ''There's a private empire and the Earth,'' she said. The Earth was there for all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And the private empire is?'' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Private.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it was true. But it was also undeniable that Steyer presided over an empire of his own that, for all his transparency, was not quite public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmental impact of the Koch family is not entirely an abstract question. Koch Industries is the second-largest private company in the country, and its holdings include oil refineries, oil-services companies and one of the nation's biggest fertilizer manufacturers. Another Koch property is the paper-goods producer Georgia-Pacific, whose plant in Palatka, Fla. -- at the end of the narrow Rice Creek tributary of the St. Johns River -- is seen by Scott opponents as an object lesson in how political donations can materially affect the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, I went to see the plant with Lisa Rinaman, who heads an environmental group called St. Johns Riverkeeper, and two of her local friends, Sam Carr and Robert Virnstein. Because the plant, a hulking pale green structure festooned with smokestacks and rusting steel drums, is closed to outsiders, we approached it by water, in Virnstein's pontoon boat. Georgia-Pacific employs 1,000 people at the plant, which produces Brawny paper towels and Angel Soft bathroom tissue. The plant also has a state permit to disperse certain amounts of wastewater into the creek. As such, Rinaman takes occasional boat trips to the plant, like this one, to keep a careful eye on the consequences. It's work that she does not trust the state to do under Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rinaman's view, the Kochs have reason to be bullish on Scott. More than a decade earlier, before Koch Industries owned it, Georgia-Pacific ran into trouble with state and federal regulators over the pollution from its mill on Rice Creek. The plant's salty, dioxin-tainted wastewater was creating a putrid odor -- ''It was horrendous,'' Carr said. ''Oh, God. You'd come over the bridge and the smell was just unbelievable'' -- and worse, it was leading to ''masculinization'' among the creek's native mosquito fish. The regulators settled on a solution that left environmentalists even more alarmed. Georgia-Pacific would need to take specific steps in an attempt to bring its pollution in the creek into compliance with clean-water standards. But if those steps failed, it was to then divert the wastewater to the much larger (and therefore more dilutive) St. Johns River, an ecological treasure. ''It was one of those slap-in-the-face rulings,'' Rinaman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch Industries bought the plant in 2005. Georgia-Pacific says that the $200 million in improvements that it completed were roughly twice the outlay that had been required by state and federal regulators. Even environmentalists saluted the effort. ''Now, this is one of my favorite fishing holes,'' Carr said as we sat on the creek. As if on cue, a giant alligator splashed in the water in front of us. ''That was a big one!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even though the creek was cleaner, the plant's pollutants were still above legal limits. So Georgia-Pacific, convinced it had done all it could and eager to move on, began making plans to build a $30 million pipeline to the St. Johns River. The Crist administration refused to grant it a permit to use the pipeline until it cleared a few more hurdles; these included a new kind of dioxin test that the state Department of Environmental Protection promoted as more sensitive than those commonly in use, but which was not validated under state rules. Georgia-Pacific, arguing that it should be required only to use formally sanctioned tests, managed to resist using the new method through the end of Crist's term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist had appointed two successive heads of the Department of Environmental Protection, both trained scientists with decades of experience in environmental policy. When Rick Scott took office, his choice for the post was Herschel Vinyard, an executive with a military contractor called BAE Systems Southeast Shipyards; previously, he had been a corporate lawyer specializing in regulatory issues. One of Crist's environmental appointees said the department would be primarily concerned with ''ensuring Florida's dynamic natural resources, state lands, waterbodies and beaches are protected''; Crist himself challenged the department to create ''a strategy to protect our state from the effects of climate&nbsp;change.'' The Scott administration, by contrast, described Vinyard's mission as ''protecting the natural resources of Florida, while creating the best possible mechanisms for job creation in the state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every initiative related to climate&nbsp;change was dropped. Vinyard laid off 58 employees and declared a ''time out'' on the state policy of purchasing ecologically sensitive land for protection. He also worked with the State Legislature to change the rules for environmental permits, shifting the burden of proof onto groups trying to block them. To the dismay of many editorial boards across the state, he instituted a bonus system that encouraged workers to expedite the process by which companies received permits of every kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One company to which Vinyard granted a permit was Georgia-Pacific -- the permit it had been seeking for many years under the Crist administration. The Department of Environmental Protection under Scott required some containment and monitoring measures that environmentalists had sought -- officials of the department say it was among the strictest permits they had ever issued -- but not the extra dioxin test. The Legislature also passed a provision banning the state from requiring any environmental test that was not on its officially recognized list. In Rinaman's view, this language seemed suspiciously designed to exclude the test that the Crist administration had been pushing on Georgia-Pacific. Scott signed the provision into law; he also instituted a freeze on any new regulations, and then shed existing regulations by the hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's deregulatory efforts did not go unnoticed. Americans for Prosperity invited Scott to speak at the group's Defending the Dream summit in 2013. ''Here we are, two and a half years into his term, and he's created more than 370,000 jobs in the state of Florida,'' Slade O'Brien, the Florida director of the group at the time, said by way of introduction. ''And one of the ways he did that was by eliminating over 1,000 burdensome regulations.'' When Scott spoke, he noted that the number had grown to 2,600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a NextGen fund-raiser in July, the host, Mitchell Berger, a prominent Florida lawyer, told a group of wealthy Democratic donors in Miami that the choice was stark: New ideas and new energy in direct combat with the old coal and gas barons -- ''Tom Steyer versus the Koch brothers, right?'' Steyer, in the speech that followed, offered a gentle corrective to this. It was not just about him, he said; he was hoping like-minded donors would join him. Right now, climate&nbsp;change is nowhere near the top of the list of items that motivate people to vote. He knew that he would never create the sense of a consensus for action if only one billionaire was behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of September, as the race was entering its final phase, Steyer met once again with his team, this time in a borrowed conference room on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa. NextGen data showed that in total, Crist and the local Democrats had raised $44.4 million; that was roughly half what Scott and the Republicans had raised, but still good news, considering how far down Crist had been just a few months before. The money was flowing. The Florida Democratic Party, still the big player, had spent $16.8 million thus far, and the Crist campaign was just behind, with $16.4 million. NextGen was in for $7 million so far, and about to commit to $5 million more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer got good value for his money. Crist now held a three-point lead in a head-to-head race; he and Scott were tied at 41 percent when the Libertarian candidate, Alfred Adrian Wyllie, was included. In the three markets where NextGen was advertising in August -- Tampa, Fort Myers and West Palm Beach -- Crist had moved into a lead of 2 percentage points from what two months earlier had been a deficit of 8. The Duke Energy ad, in particular, had been effective in dampening Scott's support in Tampa. Scott had just $4 million more in his cash reserves than Crist, and Baldick predicted that Scott, who had a large personal fortune, might eventually be forced to cut himself a check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I mean, the bottom line is that what we did worked and worked in a fairly significant way,'' his pollster, Geoff Garin, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Yeah,'' Steyer said, ''it feels good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, though, Steyer seemed tired. He had been traveling across the country, visiting his battleground states. He was also, as he would learn the following day, suffering from a kidney stone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign seemed to have pushed Scott to temper his image on environmental policy. Scott announced that he would reverse some of his earlier cuts to springs protection and the state's land-buying conservation program. He also said he would get tougher on polluters. He had even agreed to meet with a group of scientists who offered to explain to him why so many of them thought climate&nbsp;change was a genuine threat. (The scientists were disappointed by the meeting, though; during its 30-minute duration, the governor did not ask a single question about the climate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With six weeks left before Election Day, NextGen and Americans for Prosperity were each gearing up for aggressive get-out-the-vote efforts, befitting their strange new role as political parties in all but name. A.F.P. had spent the year visiting 280,000 households as part of a ''voter education'' program, knocking on doors and leaving door-handle placards: ''Thank you Gov. Scott for creating jobs.'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, said he expected to follow up with as many as 120,000 of them before Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tampa, Steyer and his team were tending to some details about their last-minute commercial blitz. The Crist campaign, Baldick said, had asked if they would extend their advertising in Fort Myers and Tampa; he suggested Steyer do Tampa, but skip Fort Myers. The additional $2 million for new television and online ads would come out of Steyer's own pocket. The big-money donors that he had hoped would join him had not yet materialized, at least as of mid-September, when federal and Florida election filings showed that Steyer had provided $31.6 million of the $35 million NextGen raised nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting, Steyer sat down with 10 student volunteers in the University of South Florida alumni hall. They told him about their interest in solar power and restoring sea grass, their hopes to reduce emissions in India and oil dependence in Trinidad. Steyer could not have been happier. ''The younger you are, the more you agree, the more urgent you think it is,'' he told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he stood up and took a few of them to a NextGen call center near campus, the exhaustion I'd seen in him earlier that day had dissipated. The swing was back in his arms, in his gait. He took his place beside the students to hit the phones. This was democracy at work. ''I know you're in the checkout line, but. . . .'' he said to one contact who picked up. Then, to another he said, ''If you can believe it, I'm the person who started NextGen Climate Action.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Tom Steyer and seven campaign advisers sat in a small conference room in Coral Gables, Fla., trying to figure out how to save the world. Steyer, who is 57, has a fortune of roughly $1.5 billion, and his advisers were among the most talented political operatives in the United States. Steyer is especially concerned about climate&nbsp;change, and his immediate goal, the object of discussion that day, was to replace the sitting governor of Florida, Rick Scott, a Republican who has questioned the very existence of anthropogenic climate&nbsp;change, with Charlie Crist, the previous governor, whose environmental views hew more closely to Steyer's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead Florida strategist, Nick Baldick, was running through the campaign numbers. ''There's a problem here,'' he said, brandishing a printout. Two bars, blue and red, were labeled ''Total Raised,'' and the red Republican bar was notably longer. ''It's just ugly,'' Baldick said, with a shake of his head: ''$74 million to Crist's $24 million. And they have $38 million cash on hand to his $15 million.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring, when Crist was riding a double-digit lead, Florida looked like a safe bet, but then Scott unleashed an $18 million ad campaign against Crist, painting him as a hack careerist who loves Obamacare and lays off teachers. Not only had Crist's lead vanished, now he was losing in the key swing district of Tampa, winning by too little in Democrat-friendly West Palm and losing by too much in Republican-leaning Fort Myers. And as Baldick's numbers showed, neither the state Democratic Party nor Crist could match the barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Baldick is stocky and bald in the way that suggests he should always have a cigar jutting from his mouth. He is known in Democratic politics for his irascibility. It's part act -- political consultants make their trade in bad news -- but he was truly annoyed this morning, he told me, largely because I was present at the meeting. Steyer and his communications team had invited me into their inner sanctum partly to make a point, namely that Steyer was more transparent than his rival powers, the conservative billionaire Koch brothers. Baldick saw it as a needless risk. In his decades of experience (in the Clinton, Gore and Edwards presidential campaigns, to name a few), reporters were not invited into sensitive strategy sessions like this one. It wasn't done and shouldn't be done, he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer, though, saw visibility as part of the job. He made his money as the founder of a successful hedge fund called Farallon Capital Management and so had spent most of his adult life wading through prospectuses and annual reports. He seemed enthralled and energized by his new course of study in domestic politics, with its incongruent mix of idealism and cynicism. This was democracy in action, real people making real change, not just mysterious figures behind closed doors. Tall, with grayish blond hair and shaggy sideburns, Steyer was in constant motion: his arms waving, his hands slicing the air, his tie -- always the same stiff, scotch plaid -- swaying to and fro as he spoke. In talking about the political offshoots of his money, he sometimes had the air of a new father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer's long-term goal was to build an organization called NextGen Climate Action, which could mirror and oppose the rival private interests who devoted their own fortunes to blocking any action on climate&nbsp;change. Chief among those rivals were Charles and David Koch, the brothers who run Koch Industries. Steyer was especially interested in enacting a cap-and-trade system, which would allow companies to buy or sell emission rights under a strict state or federal limit. The Koch brothers, meanwhile, have worked hard to prevent, among many other government interventions, the adoption of a cap-and-trade system, which they view as the ultimate in reckless government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Steyer didn't step in as a counterweight, he reasoned, no one else would; after all, no one else had so far. Steyer pledged to spend at least $50 million of his own fortune this election season by way of NextGen on behalf of Democrats or, perhaps more accurate, against Republicans, in Florida and six other states: Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Most of the races were for the Senate, which Republicans are in a position to retake this fall. But the race that was closest to Steyer's heart was here, in the state ''most vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change,'' as he put it; a crucial swing state where the Koch brothers had already spent millions to establish a political presence. Charlie Crist himself journeyed to NextGen's San Francisco headquarters in June, to tell Steyer and many of these same strategists about sea-level rise in Miami, its troubling effects on drinking water and flood insurance and about the many ways in which he differed from Rick Scott. (''There couldn't be a clearer choice,'' Crist told me later. ''I'm, like, the opposite of this guy.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crist had been a Republican for most of his long career in Florida politics -- as a state senator in 1992, as an education commissioner, as an attorney general -- but after a single term as governor, during which he later claimed to have become increasingly alienated from a party that he described as ''anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-minority, anti-gay, anti-education, anti-environment,'' he sought an independent U.S. Senate seat instead. He lost that bid to Marco Rubio, and in 2012 he announced (via Twitter) that he had registered as a Democrat. In November 2013 after an encouraging meeting with Steyer, he announced that he would seek the governor's seat again. In his last turn as governor, Crist took climate&nbsp;change seriously; he pushed through a law that authorized the state's Department of Environmental Protection to develop a cap-and-trade system. Scott and the Legislature dismantled the law, and Scott redirected the agency instead to ''ensure that Florida leads the nation in new partnerships between government and industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the cramped conference table, Baldick rattled off more news, both good and bad. A series of recent polls found that both candidates were extremely unlikable. (''Crist and Scott Could Make History by Being So Unpopular in Florida'' was the headline of one recent report at FiveThirtyEight.com.) Baldick said this could actually be a positive development. ''Both of them are not liked,'' he explained, but ''if you think people are going to show up because they hate, not love -- I do -- there's more people who hate Scott.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer leaned back in contemplation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You think that's what gets people to vote?'' he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh yeah, hate, fear --''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The negative emotions,'' Steyer said, radiating subtle disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Baldick gave him a look. ''You can go with love,'' he said, to which Steyer, playing along, quickly replied, ''We're from California, Nick.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were laughs all around. Baldick moved on to the results from a poll the team conducted of Hispanic voters, a demographic whose turnout on Election Day was a central element of the NextGen strategy. The good news was that environmental messaging did seem to make Hispanic voters turn away from Scott. The bad news was that this messaging made them no likelier to actually vote. The solution, Baldick informed Steyer, was to tie environmental issues to broader themes that are proven to bring voters to the polls, starting with the attack line -- a shopworn one, but one that worked well against Mitt Romney in 2012 -- that Scott is ''not for you.'' Baldick ticked off ways to bolster that pitch: ''He cut education to pay for corporate tax cuts, he let polluters pollute the Everglades. . . .''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The poll did contain some welcome news about another group vital to Crist's chances: Youth voters said they would respond directly to the climate issue by coming out to vote. ''Not only do they understand it, but it impacts them,'' Baldick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer lit up. ''Nick, if this really works, we should'' -- he waggled his hands above his ears in the universal gesture of going nuts -- ''as opposed to trying harder on something that's not working.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Newcomers to politics, especially baby boomers, are always excited about voters who are the same age as their children. Before the team could get into the nuances of motivating young people, an aide came in to say that Crist himself had just shown up for a scheduled session with Steyer. I imagined this meant our meeting was over; onetime governors are conditioned to expect that others will drop everything when they arrive. But Steyer wanted to hear more about the youth vote. Charlie Crist would have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the winter of 2000, just as John McCain and George W. Bush were entering a pivotal series of Republican primaries, a mysterious new campaign ad appeared on television stations in New York, Ohio and California. The ad showed McCain's disembodied head floating over belching smokestacks as a narrator intoned about votes McCain had made against solar and renewable-energy incentives -- policies that in reality he had supported. The ad was sponsored by a group called Republicans for Clean Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The financial backers behind Republicans for Clean Air were the Texas billionaires Charles and Sam Wyly. They had a history of supporting Bush, but they were also heavily invested in a company seeking government-induced increases in alternative-energy production. The revelation that a single Texas family could so easily insert itself into the political process set off a round of frenzied indignation, and after McCain's loss, it became crucial fodder for his effort to reform the national campaign-finance system. In 2002, along with a Democratic senator, Russell D. Feingold, he helped push a bill through Congress that ranked alongside some of the most sweeping efforts to contain ''special interest'' money in American history: the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned corporate contributions to candidates; the Smith-Connally Act of 1943, which prohibited union donations to candidates; and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which placed strict limits on what individuals could give to parties and campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before 2002, parties could accept unlimited donations from individuals or groups (corporations, labor unions, etc.) so long as they devoted the funds -- so-called ''soft money'' -- to the amorphous act of ''party building.'' The McCain-Feingold law, as it came to be known, banned soft-money contributions, and it also prohibited political groups that operate outside the regulated system and its donation limits -- like the Wylys and their Republicans for Clean Air -- from running ''issue ads'' that appear to help or hurt a candidate close to an election. It implemented tough fines and even prison terms for those who illegally coordinated with the official campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2010, the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court effectively blew apart the McCain-Feingold restrictions on outside groups and their use of corporate and labor money in elections. That same year, a related ruling from a lower court made it easier for wealthy individuals to finance those groups to the bottom of their bank accounts if they so chose. What followed has been the most unbridled spending in elections since before Watergate. In 2000, outside groups spent $52 million on campaigns, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By 2012, that number had increased to $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The result was a massive power shift, from the party bosses to the rich individuals who ran the super PACs (as most of these new organizations came to be called). Almost overnight, traditional party functions -- running TV commercials, setting up field operations, maintaining voter databases, even recruiting candidates -- were being supplanted by outside groups. And the shift was partly because of one element of McCain-Feingold that remains: the ban on giving unlimited soft money to parties. In the party universe, rich players like the Wylys, Tom Steyer or the Kochs were but single planets among many. The party bosses had to balance their interests against those who brought just as much to the table in the form of money or votes. A party platform has to account for both the interests of the oil industry and those of the ethanol industry; those of the casino industry and those of the anti-gambling religious right; those of Wall Street and those of labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the advent of Citizens United, any players with the wherewithal, and there are surprisingly many of them, can start what are in essence their own political parties, built around pet causes or industries and backing politicians uniquely answerable to them. No longer do they have to buy into the system. Instead, they buy their own pieces of it outright, to use as they see fit. ''Suddenly, we privatized politics,'' says Trevor Potter, an election lawyer who helped draft the McCain-Feingold law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we have Michael Bloomberg, who has committed to spending $50 million to support gun-control legislation; his Independence USA PAC, meanwhile, is spending $25 million this fall to elect ''centrists.'' We have the TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his group Ending Spending, which has spent roughly $10 million so far this year to elect fiscal conservatives to Congress, an effort that has drawn support from the billionaire hedge-fund executive Paul E. Singer, who has also devoted tens of millions to Republican candidates who share his views on Israel. We have Mark Zuckerberg and his FWD.us, with a budget of about $50 million to push an immigration overhaul. In 2014, as of early October, when the campaigns had yet to do their big final pushes, overall spending was already more than $444 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Roughly $231 million was from the parties and their congressional committees, the rest from outside spending. The biggest chunk of that by far came from super PACs -- more than $196 million. Looking at those numbers, it's not hard to understand why Crist was willing to wait outside a conference room in Coral Gables for Steyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer, with his $50 million pledge, is one of the most deep-pocketed political arrivistes. But he has a long way to go to catch up with the Koch brothers, whose own group, Americans for Prosperity, already has political operations in every state that Steyer is contesting, along with 28 others. The group says it will spend at least $125 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president of Americans for Prosperity is Tim Phillips. Tall and fit at 50, Phillips holds forth with evident delight, betraying the slight accent of his native South Carolina, on whatever topic is at hand. (A somewhat larger than usual breakfast, for instance, earns an emphatic ''I'm in awe of our country at this moment.'') After attending Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Phillips worked on several congressional races before starting a consulting firm with the Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed. The Kochs hired Phillips in 2005 to make Americans for Prosperity into a force that could defeat liberalism and elect true free-market conservatives -- ones who understood that when business gets hurt, people lose jobs and the country suffers -- and make them pay a price if they strayed. (David Koch is the chairman of the group's foundation, while Charles Koch has no formal role.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans for Prosperity started small, with an effort in Charles Koch's home state of Kansas to defeat a proposed tax increase; it then moved on to spearhead a quixotic fight against the teachers' union over pay in Wisconsin. As recently as 2008, the group's activities were negligible, and it had just $7 million in its operating budget, according to its Internal Revenue Service filing. But after Citizens United, donations poured in. In 2012, it raised $115 million. It is impossible to know the identities of the donors, though the group's annual closed-door conferences are regularly attended by many of the biggest conservative donors in the country, including the hedge-fund executive Foster Friess and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where does the money go? Americans for Prosperity obviously spends a lot on television, but it also maintains offices in 35 states with 600 paid staff members. The group funds phone banks, big-ticket events and many other details like beer cozies and water bottles. Its biggest chapter is in Florida, where its 50 paid staff members work out of 10 offices and constitute a year-round organization that rivals that of the state Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The A.F.P. offices are in the same brick corporate campus in Arlington, Va., that housed George W. Bush's campaign in 2004. The narrow white hallways and gray cubicles would be somewhat grim if not for Phillips's insistence that each staff member place an image of something he or she holds dear on their nameplates (a pinup of the actress Jane Russell, the logo of the University of Virginia or, on Phillips's own door, a photo of the band U2, with his own head pasted atop Bono's body). A.F.P. operates at such a low hum that it would have been hard to guess, at the moment I was visiting, how many different operations its staff members were overseeing simultaneously. There was a $1 million ad buy criticizing the Democrat Mark Begich in Alaska, as well as a new ad campaign against Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado. There was a series of rallies attacking the Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley in Iowa and a door-knocking campaign for Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there was the balloon. Phillips pointed to a photograph on the wall, depicting a scene from an event Americans for Prosperity held in Bozeman, Mont., in 2009: a 70-foot balloon awaiting takeoff. ''We called it the 'Cost of Hot Air,' '' Phillips said. At the time, A.F.P. was trying to counter the movement to establish a cap-and-trade system. Many Republicans, including John McCain, supported such a system, and a bipartisan implementation of it seemed likely upon Obama's election. A.F.P.'s balloon was part of a national tour to block it. ''We put on the side of the balloon: 'Cap and trade means: higher taxes, lost jobs, less freedom' -- six words.'' It made dozens of trips, including one over Al Gore's house in Tennessee. All the while, Americans for Prosperity, joined by other conservative groups, directed ads and phone calls pressuring lawmakers to vote against the major cap-and-trade bill when it came up for a vote in 2009; Phillips helped to rebrand the bill more negatively as ''cap and tax.'' It died in the Senate, and support for cap-and-trade among Republican officeholders fell to a negligible level, where it remains today. ''I rode more hot-air balloons in that year-and-a-half period than I ever want to ride again,'' Phillips said. ''I do not like hot-air balloons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the group's efforts on behalf of Scott, Phillips says, the most important factor is the growth of the volunteer base of Americans for Prosperity, which it now numbers into the tens of thousands. The first lesson of party politics is that winning elections means getting out the vote, and getting out the vote means signing up volunteers. Phillips spends a lot of time thinking about what will keep them happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given their negatives, neither Scott nor Crist was going to win by sweeping new converts off their feet. Big spending on television was certainly threatening to make a difference for Scott. But if Crist could catch up on TV, with Steyer's help, the election was going to be decided by which side did a better job of identifying new sympathetic voters and then prodding them out to the polls. It required the hard work of knocking on doors, which can be especially brutal under the hot Florida sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The movement is independent of the party, which is the way Phillips wants it. When Rick Scott said he would support an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, Americans for Prosperity let him know about its displeasure through a deluge of phone calls and letters and even a protest at the State Capitol. Scott ultimately made no effort to push it through the Legislature, many of whose Republican members have been supported by the group as well. ''I think he started hearing from some other voices, A.F.P. and some of the other organizations,'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, had said, ''and I think they sort of superseded what was going on in his own staff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phillips said the group's volunteers would have it no other way. ''They have to feel like the organization is genuinely a principled outfit,'' he said. ''If they think you're just an appendage of the party, they can go to the party. Why do they need you?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later in August, Kat Taylor, who has been married to Tom Steyer for 28 years, offered to show me around TomKat Ranch, the family's 1,800-acre spread on the central California coast, and talk about how the family had become involved in climate politics. Taylor, 56, is slight yet muscular, with short and wavy gray hair and a tattoo of a flowering vine around her impressive biceps. She spends part of her week overseeing the ranch, and its 130 head of grass-fed cattle, but most of her time is spent running the community bank that she and Steyer founded in 2007, when all four of their children were older and more independent. Taylor supported Steyer in his latest political mission, she said, even after he told her, ''This is going to give us a lot more visibility, and it won't all be positive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, she was bothered by the questioning of his motives and the occasional charges of hypocrisy from the press and his political enemies. Yes, she patiently explained to me, Steyer's firm made many millions from investments in coal mines and coal-fired power plants in Asia and Australia, as it had in all sorts of other industries. But that was long before he came to believe that the fate of the planet depended upon curbing carbon emissions, and he has since divested his personal portfolio of any fossil-fuel-related investments. Taylor had also learned to deflect the inevitable questions about whether he was preparing his own run for office. (''I don't think he thinks that's the right priority right now,'' she said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer has been involved in politics for years. He was a major fund-raiser for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and in 2006 worked closely with Chris Lehane, a longtime Democratic strategist, to defeat a Republican effort to change California's electoral-college rules. (Lehane has been acting as Steyer's personal political strategist ever since.) In 2012, though, Steyer read an essay in Rolling Stone (''Global Warming's Terrifying New Math''), in which Bill McKibben, the writer and climate activist, suggested that fossil-fuel interests had too much money at stake to let the political system do anything about carbon emissions. The only alternative, McKibben wrote, was a mass movement, and the only way to start a mass movement was to articulate a consistent, fact-based moral argument for change. At that moment, Taylor said, ''Tom realized that the climate threat was near, present, imminent, massive -- and aggravates every other crisis, whether it's hunger or civil rights.'' He had to do something different. So a few months later he and Taylor invited McKibben to the ranch for a war council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We were in the ranch's spartan barn house when Taylor recounted this. The council had been right there, beneath the reclaimed wood beams. Lehane was there, and so was John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff who would later join the Obama White House as an adviser. They all considered various ways to act. They agreed, finally, that Steyer should try a few experiments, but should come out with particular force against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would link oil-rich Canadian sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. In March 2013, Steyer sent a letter to Stephen Lynch, a Democratic congressman and pipeline supporter who was seeking the Senate seat left vacant by John Kerry when he became secretary of state. The letter demanded that Lynch renounce his support for Keystone by ''high noon Friday'' or face aggressive opposition. It was an obvious stunt, but it got attention. Lynch declared that ''billionaires won't shove me around''; Steyer responded by providing Lynch's primary opponent, Ed Markey, an anti-Keystone congressman, with nearly $700,000 in campaign support. Markey, who said he did not want Steyer's help, won handily. In Virginia that same year, Steyer bought $8 million in television ads and mailings to highlight the climate-change skepticism of the Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. The Democrat, Terry McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic Party, won by 2.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much credit Steyer can claim in either of these victories is debatable. But by early 2014, just about every Democrat considering a competitive run this year, including Charlie Crist, had made a pilgrimage to see Steyer in San Francisco. And in April, the State Department announced it would delay its decision on Keystone XL pending an analysis of expected legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a victory, but it did not necessarily echo the consistent, moral argument of McKibben's initial call. As we spoke, NextGen was spending about $100,000 to build and operate a wooden Noah's Ark on wheels that it would drive around the state, taunting Scott for his failure to address climate&nbsp;change. It was also spending $2 million on an ad campaign that blamed Scott for the failure of Duke Energy, a major Scott contributor, to upgrade one nuclear power plant and build another, for which it had to increase utility fees, despite the fact that Scott had no direct say over this decision. Even beyond the publicity stunts and elisions of fact, NextGen's campaign largess was itself a capitulation to the post-Citizens United world. Steyer was applying pressure to the political system in a way no average American could. It seemed undemocratic. But Steyer saw it as simple pragmatism; the other side was ''playing multiples,'' he said, and he had to operate ''in the real world the way the real world works.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our tour wound down in front of a long, waist-high granite pool filled with koi, the remains of an unsuccessful attempt at sustainable fish farming that now doubled as a huge outdoor dining table. As we stood beside it, Taylor told me about charts she had seen, apparently online, placing Steyer at the center of a web of liberal interests: a conservative answer to the many liberal diagrams of ''The Kochtopus.'' The connections were all real, or at least many of them were. That was the whole point of playing multiples. But the comparison seemed to bother her. ''There's a private empire and the Earth,'' she said. The Earth was there for all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And the private empire is?'' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Private.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it was true. But it was also undeniable that Steyer presided over an empire of his own that, for all his transparency, was not quite public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The environmental impact of the Koch family is not entirely an abstract question. Koch Industries is the second-largest private company in the country, and its holdings include oil refineries, oil-services companies and one of the nation's biggest fertilizer manufacturers. Another Koch property is the paper-goods producer Georgia-Pacific, whose plant in Palatka, Fla. -- at the end of the narrow Rice Creek tributary of the St. Johns River -- is seen by Scott opponents as an object lesson in how political donations can materially affect the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July, I went to see the plant with Lisa Rinaman, who heads an environmental group called St. Johns Riverkeeper, and two of her local friends, Sam Carr and Robert Virnstein. Because the plant, a hulking pale green structure festooned with smokestacks and rusting steel drums, is closed to outsiders, we approached it by water, in Virnstein's pontoon boat. Georgia-Pacific employs 1,000 people at the plant, which produces Brawny paper towels and Angel Soft bathroom tissue. The plant also has a state permit to disperse certain amounts of wastewater into the creek. As such, Rinaman takes occasional boat trips to the plant, like this one, to keep a careful eye on the consequences. It's work that she does not trust the state to do under Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Rinaman's view, the Kochs have reason to be bullish on Scott. More than a decade earlier, before Koch Industries owned it, Georgia-Pacific ran into trouble with state and federal regulators over the pollution from its mill on Rice Creek. The plant's salty, dioxin-tainted wastewater was creating a putrid odor -- ''It was horrendous,'' Carr said. ''Oh, God. You'd come over the bridge and the smell was just unbelievable'' -- and worse, it was leading to ''masculinization'' among the creek's native mosquito fish. The regulators settled on a solution that left environmentalists even more alarmed. Georgia-Pacific would need to take specific steps in an attempt to bring its pollution in the creek into compliance with clean-water standards. But if those steps failed, it was to then divert the wastewater to the much larger (and therefore more dilutive) St. Johns River, an ecological treasure. ''It was one of those slap-in-the-face rulings,'' Rinaman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Koch Industries bought the plant in 2005. Georgia-Pacific says that the $200 million in improvements that it completed were roughly twice the outlay that had been required by state and federal regulators. Even environmentalists saluted the effort. ''Now, this is one of my favorite fishing holes,'' Carr said as we sat on the creek. As if on cue, a giant alligator splashed in the water in front of us. ''That was a big one!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even though the creek was cleaner, the plant's pollutants were still above legal limits. So Georgia-Pacific, convinced it had done all it could and eager to move on, began making plans to build a $30 million pipeline to the St. Johns River. The Crist administration refused to grant it a permit to use the pipeline until it cleared a few more hurdles; these included a new kind of dioxin test that the state Department of Environmental Protection promoted as more sensitive than those commonly in use, but which was not validated under state rules. Georgia-Pacific, arguing that it should be required only to use formally sanctioned tests, managed to resist using the new method through the end of Crist's term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crist had appointed two successive heads of the Department of Environmental Protection, both trained scientists with decades of experience in environmental policy. When Rick Scott took office, his choice for the post was Herschel Vinyard, an executive with a military contractor called BAE Systems Southeast Shipyards; previously, he had been a corporate lawyer specializing in regulatory issues. One of Crist's environmental appointees said the department would be primarily concerned with ''ensuring Florida's dynamic natural resources, state lands, waterbodies and beaches are protected''; Crist himself challenged the department to create ''a strategy to protect our state from the effects of climate&nbsp;change.'' The Scott administration, by contrast, described Vinyard's mission as ''protecting the natural resources of Florida, while creating the best possible mechanisms for job creation in the state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly every initiative related to climate&nbsp;change was dropped. Vinyard laid off 58 employees and declared a ''time out'' on the state policy of purchasing ecologically sensitive land for protection. He also worked with the State Legislature to change the rules for environmental permits, shifting the burden of proof onto groups trying to block them. To the dismay of many editorial boards across the state, he instituted a bonus system that encouraged workers to expedite the process by which companies received permits of every kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One company to which Vinyard granted a permit was Georgia-Pacific -- the permit it had been seeking for many years under the Crist administration. The Department of Environmental Protection under Scott required some containment and monitoring measures that environmentalists had sought -- officials of the department say it was among the strictest permits they had ever issued -- but not the extra dioxin test. The Legislature also passed a provision banning the state from requiring any environmental test that was not on its officially recognized list. In Rinaman's view, this language seemed suspiciously designed to exclude the test that the Crist administration had been pushing on Georgia-Pacific. Scott signed the provision into law; he also instituted a freeze on any new regulations, and then shed existing regulations by the hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scott's deregulatory efforts did not go unnoticed. Americans for Prosperity invited Scott to speak at the group's Defending the Dream summit in 2013. ''Here we are, two and a half years into his term, and he's created more than 370,000 jobs in the state of Florida,'' Slade O'Brien, the Florida director of the group at the time, said by way of introduction. ''And one of the ways he did that was by eliminating over 1,000 burdensome regulations.'' When Scott spoke, he noted that the number had grown to 2,600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a NextGen fund-raiser in July, the host, Mitchell Berger, a prominent Florida lawyer, told a group of wealthy Democratic donors in Miami that the choice was stark: New ideas and new energy in direct combat with the old coal and gas barons -- ''Tom Steyer versus the Koch brothers, right?'' Steyer, in the speech that followed, offered a gentle corrective to this. It was not just about him, he said; he was hoping like-minded donors would join him. Right now, climate&nbsp;change is nowhere near the top of the list of items that motivate people to vote. He knew that he would never create the sense of a consensus for action if only one billionaire was behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Near the end of September, as the race was entering its final phase, Steyer met once again with his team, this time in a borrowed conference room on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa. NextGen data showed that in total, Crist and the local Democrats had raised $44.4 million; that was roughly half what Scott and the Republicans had raised, but still good news, considering how far down Crist had been just a few months before. The money was flowing. The Florida Democratic Party, still the big player, had spent $16.8 million thus far, and the Crist campaign was just behind, with $16.4 million. NextGen was in for $7 million so far, and about to commit to $5 million more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer got good value for his money. Crist now held a three-point lead in a head-to-head race; he and Scott were tied at 41 percent when the Libertarian candidate, Alfred Adrian Wyllie, was included. In the three markets where NextGen was advertising in August -- Tampa, Fort Myers and West Palm Beach -- Crist had moved into a lead of 2 percentage points from what two months earlier had been a deficit of 8. The Duke Energy ad, in particular, had been effective in dampening Scott's support in Tampa. Scott had just $4 million more in his cash reserves than Crist, and Baldick predicted that Scott, who had a large personal fortune, might eventually be forced to cut himself a check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I mean, the bottom line is that what we did worked and worked in a fairly significant way,'' his pollster, Geoff Garin, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yeah,'' Steyer said, ''it feels good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, though, Steyer seemed tired. He had been traveling across the country, visiting his battleground states. He was also, as he would learn the following day, suffering from a kidney stone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The campaign seemed to have pushed Scott to temper his image on environmental policy. Scott announced that he would reverse some of his earlier cuts to springs protection and the state's land-buying conservation program. He also said he would get tougher on polluters. He had even agreed to meet with a group of scientists who offered to explain to him why so many of them thought climate&nbsp;change was a genuine threat. (The scientists were disappointed by the meeting, though; during its 30-minute duration, the governor did not ask a single question about the climate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With six weeks left before Election Day, NextGen and Americans for Prosperity were each gearing up for aggressive get-out-the-vote efforts, befitting their strange new role as political parties in all but name. A.F.P. had spent the year visiting 280,000 households as part of a ''voter education'' program, knocking on doors and leaving door-handle placards: ''Thank you Gov. Scott for creating jobs.'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, said he expected to follow up with as many as 120,000 of them before Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Tampa, Steyer and his team were tending to some details about their last-minute commercial blitz. The Crist campaign, Baldick said, had asked if they would extend their advertising in Fort Myers and Tampa; he suggested Steyer do Tampa, but skip Fort Myers. The additional $2 million for new television and online ads would come out of Steyer's own pocket. The big-money donors that he had hoped would join him had not yet materialized, at least as of mid-September, when federal and Florida election filings showed that Steyer had provided $31.6 million of the $35 million NextGen raised nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the meeting, Steyer sat down with 10 student volunteers in the University of South Florida alumni hall. They told him about their interest in solar power and restoring sea grass, their hopes to reduce emissions in India and oil dependence in Trinidad. Steyer could not have been happier. ''The younger you are, the more you agree, the more urgent you think it is,'' he told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he stood up and took a few of them to a NextGen call center near campus, the exhaustion I'd seen in him earlier that day had dissipated. The swing was back in his arms, in his gait. He took his place beside the students to hit the phones. This was democracy at work. ''I know you're in the checkout line, but. . . .'' he said to one contact who picked up. Then, to another he said, ''If you can believe it, I'm the person who started NextGen Climate Action.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Tom Steyer and seven campaign advisers sat in a small conference room in Coral Gables, Fla., trying to figure out how to save the world. Steyer, who is 57, has a fortune of roughly $1.5 billion, and his advisers were among the most talented political operatives in the United States. Steyer is especially concerned about climate&nbsp;change, and his immediate goal, the object of discussion that day, was to replace the sitting governor of Florida, Rick Scott, a Republican who has questioned the very existence of anthropogenic climate&nbsp;change, with Charlie Crist, the previous governor, whose environmental views hew more closely to Steyer's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead Florida strategist, Nick Baldick, was running through the campaign numbers. ''There's a problem here,'' he said, brandishing a printout. Two bars, blue and red, were labeled ''Total Raised,'' and the red Republican bar was notably longer. ''It's just ugly,'' Baldick said, with a shake of his head: ''$74 million to Crist's $24 million. And they have $38 million cash on hand to his $15 million.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the spring, when Crist was riding a double-digit lead, Florida looked like a safe bet, but then Scott unleashed an $18 million ad campaign against Crist, painting him as a hack careerist who loves Obamacare and lays off teachers. Not only had Crist's lead vanished, now he was losing in the key swing district of Tampa, winning by too little in Democrat-friendly West Palm and losing by too much in Republican-leaning Fort Myers. And as Baldick's numbers showed, neither the state Democratic Party nor Crist could match the barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Baldick is stocky and bald in the way that suggests he should always have a cigar jutting from his mouth. He is known in Democratic politics for his irascibility. It's part act -- political consultants make their trade in bad news -- but he was truly annoyed this morning, he told me, largely because I was present at the meeting. Steyer and his communications team had invited me into their inner sanctum partly to make a point, namely that Steyer was more transparent than his rival powers, the conservative billionaire Koch brothers. Baldick saw it as a needless risk. In his decades of experience (in the Clinton, Gore and Edwards presidential campaigns, to name a few), reporters were not invited into sensitive strategy sessions like this one. It wasn't done and shouldn't be done, he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer, though, saw visibility as part of the job. He made his money as the founder of a successful hedge fund called Farallon Capital Management and so had spent most of his adult life wading through prospectuses and annual reports. He seemed enthralled and energized by his new course of study in domestic politics, with its incongruent mix of idealism and cynicism. This was democracy in action, real people making real change, not just mysterious figures behind closed doors. Tall, with grayish blond hair and shaggy sideburns, Steyer was in constant motion: his arms waving, his hands slicing the air, his tie -- always the same stiff, scotch plaid -- swaying to and fro as he spoke. In talking about the political offshoots of his money, he sometimes had the air of a new father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer's long-term goal was to build an organization called NextGen Climate Action, which could mirror and oppose the rival private interests who devoted their own fortunes to blocking any action on climate&nbsp;change. Chief among those rivals were Charles and David Koch, the brothers who run Koch Industries. Steyer was especially interested in enacting a cap-and-trade system, which would allow companies to buy or sell emission rights under a strict state or federal limit. The Koch brothers, meanwhile, have worked hard to prevent, among many other government interventions, the adoption of a cap-and-trade system, which they view as the ultimate in reckless government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Steyer didn't step in as a counterweight, he reasoned, no one else would; after all, no one else had so far. Steyer pledged to spend at least $50 million of his own fortune this election season by way of NextGen on behalf of Democrats or, perhaps more accurate, against Republicans, in Florida and six other states: Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Most of the races were for the Senate, which Republicans are in a position to retake this fall. But the race that was closest to Steyer's heart was here, in the state ''most vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change,'' as he put it; a crucial swing state where the Koch brothers had already spent millions to establish a political presence. Charlie Crist himself journeyed to NextGen's San Francisco headquarters in June, to tell Steyer and many of these same strategists about sea-level rise in Miami, its troubling effects on drinking water and flood insurance and about the many ways in which he differed from Rick Scott. (''There couldn't be a clearer choice,'' Crist told me later. ''I'm, like, the opposite of this guy.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crist had been a Republican for most of his long career in Florida politics -- as a state senator in 1992, as an education commissioner, as an attorney general -- but after a single term as governor, during which he later claimed to have become increasingly alienated from a party that he described as ''anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-minority, anti-gay, anti-education, anti-environment,'' he sought an independent U.S. Senate seat instead. He lost that bid to Marco Rubio, and in 2012 he announced (via Twitter) that he had registered as a Democrat. In November 2013 after an encouraging meeting with Steyer, he announced that he would seek the governor's seat again. In his last turn as governor, Crist took climate&nbsp;change seriously; he pushed through a law that authorized the state's Department of Environmental Protection to develop a cap-and-trade system. Scott and the Legislature dismantled the law, and Scott redirected the agency instead to ''ensure that Florida leads the nation in new partnerships between government and industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the cramped conference table, Baldick rattled off more news, both good and bad. A series of recent polls found that both candidates were extremely unlikable. (''Crist and Scott Could Make History by Being So Unpopular in Florida'' was the headline of one recent report at FiveThirtyEight.com.) Baldick said this could actually be a positive development. ''Both of them are not liked,'' he explained, but ''if you think people are going to show up because they hate, not love -- I do -- there's more people who hate Scott.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer leaned back in contemplation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You think that's what gets people to vote?'' he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh yeah, hate, fear --''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The negative emotions,'' Steyer said, radiating subtle disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Baldick gave him a look. ''You can go with love,'' he said, to which Steyer, playing along, quickly replied, ''We're from California, Nick.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were laughs all around. Baldick moved on to the results from a poll the team conducted of Hispanic voters, a demographic whose turnout on Election Day was a central element of the NextGen strategy. The good news was that environmental messaging did seem to make Hispanic voters turn away from Scott. The bad news was that this messaging made them no likelier to actually vote. The solution, Baldick informed Steyer, was to tie environmental issues to broader themes that are proven to bring voters to the polls, starting with the attack line -- a shopworn one, but one that worked well against Mitt Romney in 2012 -- that Scott is ''not for you.'' Baldick ticked off ways to bolster that pitch: ''He cut education to pay for corporate tax cuts, he let polluters pollute the Everglades. . . .''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The poll did contain some welcome news about another group vital to Crist's chances: Youth voters said they would respond directly to the climate issue by coming out to vote. ''Not only do they understand it, but it impacts them,'' Baldick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer lit up. ''Nick, if this really works, we should'' -- he waggled his hands above his ears in the universal gesture of going nuts -- ''as opposed to trying harder on something that's not working.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Newcomers to politics, especially baby boomers, are always excited about voters who are the same age as their children. Before the team could get into the nuances of motivating young people, an aide came in to say that Crist himself had just shown up for a scheduled session with Steyer. I imagined this meant our meeting was over; onetime governors are conditioned to expect that others will drop everything when they arrive. But Steyer wanted to hear more about the youth vote. Charlie Crist would have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the winter of 2000, just as John McCain and George W. Bush were entering a pivotal series of Republican primaries, a mysterious new campaign ad appeared on television stations in New York, Ohio and California. The ad showed McCain's disembodied head floating over belching smokestacks as a narrator intoned about votes McCain had made against solar and renewable-energy incentives -- policies that in reality he had supported. The ad was sponsored by a group called Republicans for Clean Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The financial backers behind Republicans for Clean Air were the Texas billionaires Charles and Sam Wyly. They had a history of supporting Bush, but they were also heavily invested in a company seeking government-induced increases in alternative-energy production. The revelation that a single Texas family could so easily insert itself into the political process set off a round of frenzied indignation, and after McCain's loss, it became crucial fodder for his effort to reform the national campaign-finance system. In 2002, along with a Democratic senator, Russell D. Feingold, he helped push a bill through Congress that ranked alongside some of the most sweeping efforts to contain ''special interest'' money in American history: the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned corporate contributions to candidates; the Smith-Connally Act of 1943, which prohibited union donations to candidates; and the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which placed strict limits on what individuals could give to parties and campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before 2002, parties could accept unlimited donations from individuals or groups (corporations, labor unions, etc.) so long as they devoted the funds -- so-called ''soft money'' -- to the amorphous act of ''party building.'' The McCain-Feingold law, as it came to be known, banned soft-money contributions, and it also prohibited political groups that operate outside the regulated system and its donation limits -- like the Wylys and their Republicans for Clean Air -- from running ''issue ads'' that appear to help or hurt a candidate close to an election. It implemented tough fines and even prison terms for those who illegally coordinated with the official campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2010, the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court effectively blew apart the McCain-Feingold restrictions on outside groups and their use of corporate and labor money in elections. That same year, a related ruling from a lower court made it easier for wealthy individuals to finance those groups to the bottom of their bank accounts if they so chose. What followed has been the most unbridled spending in elections since before Watergate. In 2000, outside groups spent $52 million on campaigns, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By 2012, that number had increased to $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The result was a massive power shift, from the party bosses to the rich individuals who ran the super PACs (as most of these new organizations came to be called). Almost overnight, traditional party functions -- running TV commercials, setting up field operations, maintaining voter databases, even recruiting candidates -- were being supplanted by outside groups. And the shift was partly because of one element of McCain-Feingold that remains: the ban on giving unlimited soft money to parties. In the party universe, rich players like the Wylys, Tom Steyer or the Kochs were but single planets among many. The party bosses had to balance their interests against those who brought just as much to the table in the form of money or votes. A party platform has to account for both the interests of the oil industry and those of the ethanol industry; those of the casino industry and those of the anti-gambling religious right; those of Wall Street and those of labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the advent of Citizens United, any players with the wherewithal, and there are surprisingly many of them, can start what are in essence their own political parties, built around pet causes or industries and backing politicians uniquely answerable to them. No longer do they have to buy into the system. Instead, they buy their own pieces of it outright, to use as they see fit. ''Suddenly, we privatized politics,'' says Trevor Potter, an election lawyer who helped draft the McCain-Feingold law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we have Michael Bloomberg, who has committed to spending $50 million to support gun-control legislation; his Independence USA PAC, meanwhile, is spending $25 million this fall to elect ''centrists.'' We have the TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his group Ending Spending, which has spent roughly $10 million so far this year to elect fiscal conservatives to Congress, an effort that has drawn support from the billionaire hedge-fund executive Paul E. Singer, who has also devoted tens of millions to Republican candidates who share his views on Israel. We have Mark Zuckerberg and his FWD.us, with a budget of about $50 million to push an immigration overhaul. In 2014, as of early October, when the campaigns had yet to do their big final pushes, overall spending was already more than $444 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Roughly $231 million was from the parties and their congressional committees, the rest from outside spending. The biggest chunk of that by far came from super PACs -- more than $196 million. Looking at those numbers, it's not hard to understand why Crist was willing to wait outside a conference room in Coral Gables for Steyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer, with his $50 million pledge, is one of the most deep-pocketed political arrivistes. But he has a long way to go to catch up with the Koch brothers, whose own group, Americans for Prosperity, already has political operations in every state that Steyer is contesting, along with 28 others. The group says it will spend at least $125 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president of Americans for Prosperity is Tim Phillips. Tall and fit at 50, Phillips holds forth with evident delight, betraying the slight accent of his native South Carolina, on whatever topic is at hand. (A somewhat larger than usual breakfast, for instance, earns an emphatic ''I'm in awe of our country at this moment.'') After attending Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Phillips worked on several congressional races before starting a consulting firm with the Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed. The Kochs hired Phillips in 2005 to make Americans for Prosperity into a force that could defeat liberalism and elect true free-market conservatives -- ones who understood that when business gets hurt, people lose jobs and the country suffers -- and make them pay a price if they strayed. (David Koch is the chairman of the group's foundation, while Charles Koch has no formal role.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans for Prosperity started small, with an effort in Charles Koch's home state of Kansas to defeat a proposed tax increase; it then moved on to spearhead a quixotic fight against the teachers' union over pay in Wisconsin. As recently as 2008, the group's activities were negligible, and it had just $7 million in its operating budget, according to its Internal Revenue Service filing. But after Citizens United, donations poured in. In 2012, it raised $115 million. It is impossible to know the identities of the donors, though the group's annual closed-door conferences are regularly attended by many of the biggest conservative donors in the country, including the hedge-fund executive Foster Friess and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where does the money go? Americans for Prosperity obviously spends a lot on television, but it also maintains offices in 35 states with 600 paid staff members. The group funds phone banks, big-ticket events and many other details like beer cozies and water bottles. Its biggest chapter is in Florida, where its 50 paid staff members work out of 10 offices and constitute a year-round organization that rivals that of the state Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The A.F.P. offices are in the same brick corporate campus in Arlington, Va., that housed George W. Bush's campaign in 2004. The narrow white hallways and gray cubicles would be somewhat grim if not for Phillips's insistence that each staff member place an image of something he or she holds dear on their nameplates (a pinup of the actress Jane Russell, the logo of the University of Virginia or, on Phillips's own door, a photo of the band U2, with his own head pasted atop Bono's body). A.F.P. operates at such a low hum that it would have been hard to guess, at the moment I was visiting, how many different operations its staff members were overseeing simultaneously. There was a $1 million ad buy criticizing the Democrat Mark Begich in Alaska, as well as a new ad campaign against Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado. There was a series of rallies attacking the Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley in Iowa and a door-knocking campaign for Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there was the balloon. Phillips pointed to a photograph on the wall, depicting a scene from an event Americans for Prosperity held in Bozeman, Mont., in 2009: a 70-foot balloon awaiting takeoff. ''We called it the 'Cost of Hot Air,' '' Phillips said. At the time, A.F.P. was trying to counter the movement to establish a cap-and-trade system. Many Republicans, including John McCain, supported such a system, and a bipartisan implementation of it seemed likely upon Obama's election. A.F.P.'s balloon was part of a national tour to block it. ''We put on the side of the balloon: 'Cap and trade means: higher taxes, lost jobs, less freedom' -- six words.'' It made dozens of trips, including one over Al Gore's house in Tennessee. All the while, Americans for Prosperity, joined by other conservative groups, directed ads and phone calls pressuring lawmakers to vote against the major cap-and-trade bill when it came up for a vote in 2009; Phillips helped to rebrand the bill more negatively as ''cap and tax.'' It died in the Senate, and support for cap-and-trade among Republican officeholders fell to a negligible level, where it remains today. ''I rode more hot-air balloons in that year-and-a-half period than I ever want to ride again,'' Phillips said. ''I do not like hot-air balloons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the group's efforts on behalf of Scott, Phillips says, the most important factor is the growth of the volunteer base of Americans for Prosperity, which it now numbers into the tens of thousands. The first lesson of party politics is that winning elections means getting out the vote, and getting out the vote means signing up volunteers. Phillips spends a lot of time thinking about what will keep them happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given their negatives, neither Scott nor Crist was going to win by sweeping new converts off their feet. Big spending on television was certainly threatening to make a difference for Scott. But if Crist could catch up on TV, with Steyer's help, the election was going to be decided by which side did a better job of identifying new sympathetic voters and then prodding them out to the polls. It required the hard work of knocking on doors, which can be especially brutal under the hot Florida sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The movement is independent of the party, which is the way Phillips wants it. When Rick Scott said he would support an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, Americans for Prosperity let him know about its displeasure through a deluge of phone calls and letters and even a protest at the State Capitol. Scott ultimately made no effort to push it through the Legislature, many of whose Republican members have been supported by the group as well. ''I think he started hearing from some other voices, A.F.P. and some of the other organizations,'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, had said, ''and I think they sort of superseded what was going on in his own staff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phillips said the group's volunteers would have it no other way. ''They have to feel like the organization is genuinely a principled outfit,'' he said. ''If they think you're just an appendage of the party, they can go to the party. Why do they need you?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later in August, Kat Taylor, who has been married to Tom Steyer for 28 years, offered to show me around TomKat Ranch, the family's 1,800-acre spread on the central California coast, and talk about how the family had become involved in climate politics. Taylor, 56, is slight yet muscular, with short and wavy gray hair and a tattoo of a flowering vine around her impressive biceps. She spends part of her week overseeing the ranch, and its 130 head of grass-fed cattle, but most of her time is spent running the community bank that she and Steyer founded in 2007, when all four of their children were older and more independent. Taylor supported Steyer in his latest political mission, she said, even after he told her, ''This is going to give us a lot more visibility, and it won't all be positive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, she was bothered by the questioning of his motives and the occasional charges of hypocrisy from the press and his political enemies. Yes, she patiently explained to me, Steyer's firm made many millions from investments in coal mines and coal-fired power plants in Asia and Australia, as it had in all sorts of other industries. But that was long before he came to believe that the fate of the planet depended upon curbing carbon emissions, and he has since divested his personal portfolio of any fossil-fuel-related investments. Taylor had also learned to deflect the inevitable questions about whether he was preparing his own run for office. (''I don't think he thinks that's the right priority right now,'' she said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer has been involved in politics for years. He was a major fund-raiser for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and in 2006 worked closely with Chris Lehane, a longtime Democratic strategist, to defeat a Republican effort to change California's electoral-college rules. (Lehane has been acting as Steyer's personal political strategist ever since.) In 2012, though, Steyer read an essay in Rolling Stone (''Global Warming's Terrifying New Math''), in which Bill McKibben, the writer and climate activist, suggested that fossil-fuel interests had too much money at stake to let the political system do anything about carbon emissions. The only alternative, McKibben wrote, was a mass movement, and the only way to start a mass movement was to articulate a consistent, fact-based moral argument for change. At that moment, Taylor said, ''Tom realized that the climate threat was near, present, imminent, massive -- and aggravates every other crisis, whether it's hunger or civil rights.'' He had to do something different. So a few months later he and Taylor invited McKibben to the ranch for a war council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We were in the ranch's spartan barn house when Taylor recounted this. The council had been right there, beneath the reclaimed wood beams. Lehane was there, and so was John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff who would later join the Obama White House as an adviser. They all considered various ways to act. They agreed, finally, that Steyer should try a few experiments, but should come out with particular force against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would link oil-rich Canadian sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. In March 2013, Steyer sent a letter to Stephen Lynch, a Democratic congressman and pipeline supporter who was seeking the Senate seat left vacant by John Kerry when he became secretary of state. The letter demanded that Lynch renounce his support for Keystone by ''high noon Friday'' or face aggressive opposition. It was an obvious stunt, but it got attention. Lynch declared that ''billionaires won't shove me around''; Steyer responded by providing Lynch's primary opponent, Ed Markey, an anti-Keystone congressman, with nearly $700,000 in campaign support. Markey, who said he did not want Steyer's help, won handily. In Virginia that same year, Steyer bought $8 million in television ads and mailings to highlight the climate-change skepticism of the Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli. The Democrat, Terry McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic Party, won by 2.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much credit Steyer can claim in either of these victories is debatable. But by early 2014, just about every Democrat considering a competitive run this year, including Charlie Crist, had made a pilgrimage to see Steyer in San Francisco. And in April, the State Department announced it would delay its decision on Keystone XL pending an analysis of expected legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a victory, but it did not necessarily echo the consistent, moral argument of McKibben's initial call. As we spoke, NextGen was spending about $100,000 to build and operate a wooden Noah's Ark on wheels that it would drive around the state, taunting Scott for his failure to address climate&nbsp;change. It was also spending $2 million on an ad campaign that blamed Scott for the failure of Duke Energy, a major Scott contributor, to upgrade one nuclear power plant and build another, for which it had to increase utility fees, despite the fact that Scott had no direct say over this decision. Even beyond the publicity stunts and elisions of fact, NextGen's campaign largess was itself a capitulation to the post-Citizens United world. Steyer was applying pressure to the political system in a way no average American could. It seemed undemocratic. But Steyer saw it as simple pragmatism; the other side was ''playing multiples,'' he said, and he had to operate ''in the real world the way the real world works.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our tour wound down in front of a long, waist-high granite pool filled with koi, the remains of an unsuccessful attempt at sustainable fish farming that now doubled as a huge outdoor dining table. As we stood beside it, Taylor told me about charts she had seen, apparently online, placing Steyer at the center of a web of liberal interests: a conservative answer to the many liberal diagrams of ''The Kochtopus.'' The connections were all real, or at least many of them were. That was the whole point of playing multiples. But the comparison seemed to bother her. ''There's a private empire and the Earth,'' she said. The Earth was there for all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And the private empire is?'' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Private.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it was true. But it was also undeniable that Steyer presided over an empire of his own that, for all his transparency, was not quite public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The environmental impact of the Koch family is not entirely an abstract question. Koch Industries is the second-largest private company in the country, and its holdings include oil refineries, oil-services companies and one of the nation's biggest fertilizer manufacturers. Another Koch property is the paper-goods producer Georgia-Pacific, whose plant in Palatka, Fla. -- at the end of the narrow Rice Creek tributary of the St. Johns River -- is seen by Scott opponents as an object lesson in how political donations can materially affect the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July, I went to see the plant with Lisa Rinaman, who heads an environmental group called St. Johns Riverkeeper, and two of her local friends, Sam Carr and Robert Virnstein. Because the plant, a hulking pale green structure festooned with smokestacks and rusting steel drums, is closed to outsiders, we approached it by water, in Virnstein's pontoon boat. Georgia-Pacific employs 1,000 people at the plant, which produces Brawny paper towels and Angel Soft bathroom tissue. The plant also has a state permit to disperse certain amounts of wastewater into the creek. As such, Rinaman takes occasional boat trips to the plant, like this one, to keep a careful eye on the consequences. It's work that she does not trust the state to do under Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Rinaman's view, the Kochs have reason to be bullish on Scott. More than a decade earlier, before Koch Industries owned it, Georgia-Pacific ran into trouble with state and federal regulators over the pollution from its mill on Rice Creek. The plant's salty, dioxin-tainted wastewater was creating a putrid odor -- ''It was horrendous,'' Carr said. ''Oh, God. You'd come over the bridge and the smell was just unbelievable'' -- and worse, it was leading to ''masculinization'' among the creek's native mosquito fish. The regulators settled on a solution that left environmentalists even more alarmed. Georgia-Pacific would need to take specific steps in an attempt to bring its pollution in the creek into compliance with clean-water standards. But if those steps failed, it was to then divert the wastewater to the much larger (and therefore more dilutive) St. Johns River, an ecological treasure. ''It was one of those slap-in-the-face rulings,'' Rinaman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Koch Industries bought the plant in 2005. Georgia-Pacific says that the $200 million in improvements that it completed were roughly twice the outlay that had been required by state and federal regulators. Even environmentalists saluted the effort. ''Now, this is one of my favorite fishing holes,'' Carr said as we sat on the creek. As if on cue, a giant alligator splashed in the water in front of us. ''That was a big one!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even though the creek was cleaner, the plant's pollutants were still above legal limits. So Georgia-Pacific, convinced it had done all it could and eager to move on, began making plans to build a $30 million pipeline to the St. Johns River. The Crist administration refused to grant it a permit to use the pipeline until it cleared a few more hurdles; these included a new kind of dioxin test that the state Department of Environmental Protection promoted as more sensitive than those commonly in use, but which was not validated under state rules. Georgia-Pacific, arguing that it should be required only to use formally sanctioned tests, managed to resist using the new method through the end of Crist's term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crist had appointed two successive heads of the Department of Environmental Protection, both trained scientists with decades of experience in environmental policy. When Rick Scott took office, his choice for the post was Herschel Vinyard, an executive with a military contractor called BAE Systems Southeast Shipyards; previously, he had been a corporate lawyer specializing in regulatory issues. One of Crist's environmental appointees said the department would be primarily concerned with ''ensuring Florida's dynamic natural resources, state lands, waterbodies and beaches are protected''; Crist himself challenged the department to create ''a strategy to protect our state from the effects of climate&nbsp;change.'' The Scott administration, by contrast, described Vinyard's mission as ''protecting the natural resources of Florida, while creating the best possible mechanisms for job creation in the state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly every initiative related to climate&nbsp;change was dropped. Vinyard laid off 58 employees and declared a ''time out'' on the state policy of purchasing ecologically sensitive land for protection. He also worked with the State Legislature to change the rules for environmental permits, shifting the burden of proof onto groups trying to block them. To the dismay of many editorial boards across the state, he instituted a bonus system that encouraged workers to expedite the process by which companies received permits of every kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One company to which Vinyard granted a permit was Georgia-Pacific -- the permit it had been seeking for many years under the Crist administration. The Department of Environmental Protection under Scott required some containment and monitoring measures that environmentalists had sought -- officials of the department say it was among the strictest permits they had ever issued -- but not the extra dioxin test. The Legislature also passed a provision banning the state from requiring any environmental test that was not on its officially recognized list. In Rinaman's view, this language seemed suspiciously designed to exclude the test that the Crist administration had been pushing on Georgia-Pacific. Scott signed the provision into law; he also instituted a freeze on any new regulations, and then shed existing regulations by the hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scott's deregulatory efforts did not go unnoticed. Americans for Prosperity invited Scott to speak at the group's Defending the Dream summit in 2013. ''Here we are, two and a half years into his term, and he's created more than 370,000 jobs in the state of Florida,'' Slade O'Brien, the Florida director of the group at the time, said by way of introduction. ''And one of the ways he did that was by eliminating over 1,000 burdensome regulations.'' When Scott spoke, he noted that the number had grown to 2,600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a NextGen fund-raiser in July, the host, Mitchell Berger, a prominent Florida lawyer, told a group of wealthy Democratic donors in Miami that the choice was stark: New ideas and new energy in direct combat with the old coal and gas barons -- ''Tom Steyer versus the Koch brothers, right?'' Steyer, in the speech that followed, offered a gentle corrective to this. It was not just about him, he said; he was hoping like-minded donors would join him. Right now, climate&nbsp;change is nowhere near the top of the list of items that motivate people to vote. He knew that he would never create the sense of a consensus for action if only one billionaire was behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Near the end of September, as the race was entering its final phase, Steyer met once again with his team, this time in a borrowed conference room on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa. NextGen data showed that in total, Crist and the local Democrats had raised $44.4 million; that was roughly half what Scott and the Republicans had raised, but still good news, considering how far down Crist had been just a few months before. The money was flowing. The Florida Democratic Party, still the big player, had spent $16.8 million thus far, and the Crist campaign was just behind, with $16.4 million. NextGen was in for $7 million so far, and about to commit to $5 million more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steyer got good value for his money. Crist now held a three-point lead in a head-to-head race; he and Scott were tied at 41 percent when the Libertarian candidate, Alfred Adrian Wyllie, was included. In the three markets where NextGen was advertising in August -- Tampa, Fort Myers and West Palm Beach -- Crist had moved into a lead of 2 percentage points from what two months earlier had been a deficit of 8. The Duke Energy ad, in particular, had been effective in dampening Scott's support in Tampa. Scott had just $4 million more in his cash reserves than Crist, and Baldick predicted that Scott, who had a large personal fortune, might eventually be forced to cut himself a check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I mean, the bottom line is that what we did worked and worked in a fairly significant way,'' his pollster, Geoff Garin, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yeah,'' Steyer said, ''it feels good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, though, Steyer seemed tired. He had been traveling across the country, visiting his battleground states. He was also, as he would learn the following day, suffering from a kidney stone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The campaign seemed to have pushed Scott to temper his image on environmental policy. Scott announced that he would reverse some of his earlier cuts to springs protection and the state's land-buying conservation program. He also said he would get tougher on polluters. He had even agreed to meet with a group of scientists who offered to explain to him why so many of them thought climate&nbsp;change was a genuine threat. (The scientists were disappointed by the meeting, though; during its 30-minute duration, the governor did not ask a single question about the climate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With six weeks left before Election Day, NextGen and Americans for Prosperity were each gearing up for aggressive get-out-the-vote efforts, befitting their strange new role as political parties in all but name. A.F.P. had spent the year visiting 280,000 households as part of a ''voter education'' program, knocking on doors and leaving door-handle placards: ''Thank you Gov. Scott for creating jobs.'' Chris Hudson, the group's Florida director, said he expected to follow up with as many as 120,000 of them before Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Tampa, Steyer and his team were tending to some details about their last-minute commercial blitz. The Crist campaign, Baldick said, had asked if they would extend their advertising in Fort Myers and Tampa; he suggested Steyer do Tampa, but skip Fort Myers. The additional $2 million for new television and online ads would come out of Steyer's own pocket. The big-money donors that he had hoped would join him had not yet materialized, at least as of mid-September, when federal and Florida election filings showed that Steyer had provided $31.6 million of the $35 million NextGen raised nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the meeting, Steyer sat down with 10 student volunteers in the University of South Florida alumni hall. They told him about their interest in solar power and restoring sea grass, their hopes to reduce emissions in India and oil dependence in Trinidad. Steyer could not have been happier. ''The younger you are, the more you agree, the more urgent you think it is,'' he told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time he stood up and took a few of them to a NextGen call center near campus, the exhaustion I'd seen in him earlier that day had dissipated. The swing was back in his arms, in his gait. He took his place beside the students to hit the phones. This was democracy at work. ''I know you're in the checkout line, but. . . .'' he said to one contact who picked up. Then, to another he said, ''If you can believe it, I'm the person who started NextGen Climate Action.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A gutsy Bush-era whistleblower and defender of climate science passes away. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Piltz, a gutsy whistleblower who revealed a pattern of politically torqued&nbsp;rewriting of&nbsp;climate science reports during the first term of President George W. Bush, died early Saturday morning after a fight with cancer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked largely under the radar in his many years in the government climate science bureaucracy, but became a passionate defender of climate science and campaigner for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions as a blogger and speaker&nbsp;after leaving government in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healthy democracy needs more people like Piltz. This is just as true under a Democratic administration as it was in the Bush years. (See this 2013 report from the Committee to Protect Journalists to see what I mean.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as I can remember, I first met Piltz&nbsp;in December 2002, at a three-day Washington workshop&nbsp;organized by the Bush administration to chart new directions for research on human-driven climate&nbsp;change. He was a bearish, soft-spoken and bespectacled man with an intensity and focus that took one by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington meeting was seen by many climate scientists and campaigners as a delaying tactic. Piltz, who had held senior coordinating positions&nbsp;in the U.S. Global Change Research Program&nbsp;since 1995, took me aside and we talked for a long while about what he said was an growing&nbsp;pattern of political interference&nbsp;in the shaping of government climate documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piltz encouraged me to stay in touch, saying that eventually he'd be able to provide concrete evidence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounts had already emerged from the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and elsewhere in government&nbsp;of politically-driven editing, muzzling and other interference with climate science communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Piltz meticulously and methodically compiled&nbsp;a critical paper trail.&nbsp;In 2005, as he left government, he delivered on that 2002 pledge, sending&nbsp;a fat Fedex package. In the sheaf were hand-scribbled editing marks and notations by Phil Cooney, a White House political appointee who'd come from the American Petroleum Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the resulting 2005 Times story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's my followup piece when Cooney left the Bush White House and moved to ExxonMobil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piltz went on to found Climate Science Watch, a project associated with the Government Accountability Project. In a video feature produced by that group, Piltz recalls his whistle-blowing days: </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the call came in that the University of Glasgow had voted to divest its &pound;128m endowment from fossil fuel companies, I happened to be in a room filled with climate activists in Oxford. They immediately broke into cheers. There were lots of hugs and a few tears. This was big - the first university in Europe to make such a move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day there were more celebrations in climate circles: Lego announced it would not be renewing a relationship with Shell Oil, a longtime co-branding deal that saw toddlers filling up their plastic vehicles at toy Shell petrol stations. &quot;Shell is polluting our kids' imaginations,&quot; a Greenpeace video that went viral declared, attracting more than 6m views. Pressure is building, meanwhile, on the Tate to sever the museum's longtime relationship with BP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is happening? Are fossil fuel companies - long toxic to our natural environment - becoming toxic in the public relations environment as well? It seems so. Galvanised by the &quot;carbon tracker&quot; research showing that these firms have several times more carbon in their reserves than our atmosphere can safely absorb, Oxford city council has voted to divest; so has the British Medical Association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internationally, there are hundreds of active fossil fuel divestment campaigns on university and college campuses, as well as ones targeting local city governments, non-profit foundations and religious organisations. And the victories keep getting bigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, for instance, California's Stanford University announced it would divest its $18.7bn endowment from coal. And on the eve of September's UN climate summit in New York, a portion of the Rockefeller family - a name synonymous with oil - announced that it would be divesting its foundation's holdings from fossil fuels and expanding its investments in renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are sceptical. They point out that none of this will hurt oil or coal companies - different investors will snap up their stocks and most of us will keep buying their products. Our economies, after all, remain hooked on fossil fuels, and affordable renewable options are too often out of reach. So are these battles over fossil fuel investments and sponsorships just a charade? A way to clean our consciences but not the atmosphere?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism overlooks the deeper power and potential of these campaigns. At their core, all are taking aim at the moral legitimacy of fossil fuel companies and the profits that flow from them. This movement is saying that it is unethical to be associated with an industry whose business model is based on knowingly destabilising the planet's life support systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time a new institution or brand decides to cut its ties, every time the divestment argument is publicly made, it reinforces the idea that fossil fuel profits are illegitimate - that &quot;these are now rogue industries&quot;, in the words of author Bill McKibben. And it is this illegitimacy that has the potential to break the stalemate in meaningful climate action. Because if those profits are illegitimate, and this industry is rogue, it brings us a step closer to the principle that has been sorely missing from the collective climate response so far: the polluter pays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the Rockefellers. When Valerie Rockefeller Wayne explained her decision to divest, she said that it was precisely because her family's wealth was made through oil that they were &quot;under greater moral obligation&quot; to use that wealth to stop climate&nbsp;change. That is the rationale behind polluter pays. It holds that when commercial activity creates hefty public health and environmental damage, the polluters must shoulder a significant share of the costs of repair. But it can't stop with individuals and foundations, nor can the principle be enforced voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I explore in my book This Changes Everything, fossil fuel-based companies have been pledging for more than a decade to use their profits to transition us away from dirty energy. BP has rebranded itself as &quot;Beyond Petroleum&quot; - only to back off renewables and double down on the dirtiest fossil fuels. Richard Branson pledged to spend $3bn of Virgin's profits finding a miracle green fuel and fighting global warming - only to systematically lower expectations while sharply increasing his fleet of aeroplanes. Clearly, polluters aren't going to pay for this transition unless they are forced to do so by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up until the early 1980s, that was still a guiding principle of environmental law-making in North America. And the principle hasn't totally disappeared - it's the reason why Exxon and BP were forced to pick up large portions of the bills after the Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since the era of market fundamentalism took hold in the 1990s, direct regulations and penalties on polluters have been superseded by the drive to create complex market mechanisms and voluntary initiatives designed to minimise the impact of environmental action on corporations. When it comes to climate&nbsp;change, the result of these so-called win-win solutions has been a double loss: greenhouse emissions are up and support for many forms of climate action is down, in large part because policies are perceived - quite rightly - as passing costs on to already overburdened consumers while letting big corporate polluters off the hook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this culture of lopsided sacrifice that has to stop - and the Rockefellers, oddly, are showing the way. Large parts of the Standard Oil trust, the empire John D Rockefeller co-founded in 1870, evolved into Exxon Mobil. In 2008 and 2012, Exxon earned about $45bn in profits, which remains the highest yearly profit ever reported in the US by a single company. Other Standard Oil spin-offs include Chevron and Amoco, which would later merge with BP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The astronomical profits these companies and their cohorts continue to earn from digging up and burning fossil fuels cannot continue to haemorrhage into private coffers. They must, instead, be harnessed to help roll out the clean technologies and infrastructure that will allow us to move beyond these dangerous energy sources, as well as to help us adapt to the heavy weather we have already locked in. A minimal carbon tax whose price tag can be passed on to consumers is no substitute for a real polluter-pays framework - not after decades of inaction has made the problem immeasurably worse (inaction secured, in part, by a climate denial movement funded by some of these same corporations).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's where these seemingly symbolic victories come in, from Glasgow to Lego. The profits of the fossil fuel sector, made by knowingly treating our atmosphere like a sewage dump, should not just be seen as toxic - something from which publicly minded institutions will naturally distance themselves. If we accept that those profits are morally illegitimate, they should also be seen as odious - something to which the public itself can make a claim, in order to clean up the mess these companies have left, and continue to leave, behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that happens, the pervasive sense of hopelessness in the face of a crisis as vast and costly as climate&nbsp;change will finally begin to lift.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Pentagon Signals Security Risks of Climate&nbsp;Change'' (news article, Oct. 14):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recently released Pentagon report asserts a causal relationship between climate and terrorism. The research community, however, is far from reaching a consensus on how climate interacts with other factors to bring about or worsen conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent studies suggest that conflicts associated with climate&nbsp;change manifest as intercommunal and local conflicts, and often occur in countries that suffer from weak environmental protection frameworks, high socioeconomic and political inequality, and poor recognition of water and land rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such conflicts cannot be mitigated through the financing of foreign counterterrorism units, which can further sour relationships between governments or jeopardize state legitimacy. Moreover, threats to human security from climate&nbsp;change should not provide the rationale for expanding the Pentagon's budget or have it subsume the role of civilian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we need investment in civil society mediation, resilient resource governance structures at local and national levels, and support for local institutions that are best positioned to mediate political conflict over climate-affected resources and facilitate adaptation to a more hostile climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KATE EDELEN Washington, Oct. 14, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer, a legislative associate on climate and conflict for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, previously examined the influence of climate and water on dynamics of conflict for the Peace Research Institute of Oslo's Security Implications of Climate&nbsp;Change project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recognition of the effects of extreme drought on the conflict in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, shows that global warming is already affecting us directly, and the threat will increase as our use of fossil fuels continues. The Pentagon report should be a game-changer for America's response to the United Nations agreement on this global problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, to be signed in Paris in 2015, will determine how the world responds to this threat. Will we simply follow other countries' lead, or will we lead with a proposal that builds on our strengths?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revenue-neutral carbon tax, with proceeds returned to households, would stimulate local economies while spurring new investments toward a new energy future. If Congress acts now to enact such a tax, America could set the standard for other countries to follow, one that allows the free market to choose the most efficient means of combating the climate crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- In 2008, when the archbishop of the Church of Sweden convened a conference on the threats posed by climate&nbsp;change, the church's investment managers took notice. The next year, they began removing fossil fuel companies from the church's financial portfolio -- a process that was completed last month with the removal of several natural gas companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change ''is an important issue for the church and its members,'' said Anders Thorendal, the chief investment officer of the Church of Sweden. It did not make sense, he added, to keep fossil fuel companies -- whose products result in climate-warming emissions -- in the church's portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement to end investments in fossil fuel companies began with universities, but religious institutions are joining as well. Just this month, the Anglican Diocese of Perth, Australia, announced plans to divest itself of holdings in fossil fuels, and the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand said it would consider doing the same.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sums that many churches control can be modest: The Church of Sweden's central portfolio, for example, is about $830 million, far less than the endowments of major universities. Over all, groups controlling more than $50 billion in assets have pledged to divest themselves of investments in fossil fuels, according to a study last month by Arabella Advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But churches can lend a powerful moral sway to the movement, said Marion Maddox, an expert in religion and politics at Macquarie University in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The amount of money we're talking about isn't going to bankrupt any fossil fuel companies,'' Dr. Maddox said. Divestment by the churches, however, ''has the effect of getting people to stop and think, 'Is this respectable to be involved with?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious institutions were in the vanguard of the movement to divest themselves of holdings in apartheid-riven South Africa a few decades ago, according to a recent study of divestment by Oxford academics. Now, climate&nbsp;change has come into the spotlight as an issue poised to affect some of the world's poorest communities, and groups from all faiths have pushed for action. But it is youthful and idealistic students who have largely taken the lead in urging the removal of fossil fuel investments from endowments. Last week, the University of Glasgow said it had become the first British university to announce plans for full divestment. Philanthropies and local governments have also joined the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many institutions, including churches, have been cautious. The Church of England, for example, debated the issue this year but has so far resisted pressure from activists to divest itself of investments in fossil fuels. The church is still reviewing the matter, and a new policy on climate&nbsp;change and investment is scheduled to be published next year. Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the church's commissioners, said in a statement that the Church of England continued to engage with companies ''on matters such as their carbon emissions management, deployment of capital to fossil-fuel extraction and lobbying activities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Northcott, a professor of ethics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Divinity, who has urged the Church of England and other institutions to divest themselves of holdings in fossil fuels, said, ''Churches in the main are not accustomed to standing apart from Western culture on big issues like where they put their money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Council of Churches, an umbrella group in Geneva, is one of the most significant religious bodies to divest so far, though it does not dictate the actions of its member churches. The Uniting Church in Australia, one of that country's largest Christian denominations, has announced divestment plans, as has the Anglican Church in New Zealand. In the United States, the United Church of Christ said last year that it would move toward fossil-fuel divestment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Christian churches seem to have embraced the divestment movement most strongly, though other religious groups are also concerned about climate&nbsp;change. Jewish groups tend to feel ''conflicted'' about divesting, said Jonathan Crane, a scholar of bioethics and Jewish thought at Emory University's Center for Ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Many of these Jewish organizations would certainly resonate with climate&nbsp;change concerns and take them seriously and think that actions should be done,'' he said. ''But they would raise an eyebrow, have some anxieties or ambivalences, about the actual strategy of divestment,'' because of a perception that similar strategies can get used against Israel. (Some institutions have used a separate divestment movement to pressure Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shalom Center, a Jewish group in Philadelphia that is active on environmental issues, has embraced a concept akin to fossil fuel divestment but calls it instead ''move our money/protect our planet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smaller or independent religious groups may have an easier time divesting, according to experts. Mr. Thorendal, of the Church of Sweden, said that his church's modest size made it easier to find financial managers in tune with sustainability-oriented investing. The church ran an analysis of how past investments would have fared without fossil fuels and found that eliminating such companies left both annual and long-term returns about the same. ''We didn't really see a large financial risk,'' Mr. Thorendal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church of Sweden got rid of coal and oil companies in its portfolio in 2009, and more recently decided to end its few investments in natural gas companies as well, as the environmental impacts of gas came under increasing scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thorendal emphasized that it is important not only to divest from fossil fuels, but to invest in companies whose work benefits the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Divesting is not really what's driving us,'' he said. ''What's driving us is to find the best solutions, the best companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, the Church of Sweden invests in several sustainability-oriented funds managed by Generation Investment Management, a firm co-founded by Al Gore, the climate&nbsp;change campaigner and former United States vice president. The church also seeks out niche opportunities: Last year, for example, it began investing in a microfinance fund as well as another fund dedicated to sustainable agriculture that avoids deforestation. Finding such opportunities has gotten easier in recent years, Mr. Thorendal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious officials are closely watching a few large groups that would be especially influential if they chose to divest. A move by the Lutheran church in Germany would carry symbolic weight, Dr. Northcott said, because it is the largest national church in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ultimate prize for anti-fossil-fuel campaigners would be the Vatican, which is powerful both morally and financially. A ''divest the Vatican'' movement has sprung up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Northcott rated the chances of Pope Francis's ''significantly shifting the Vatican line'' as minimal, although the pope has often urged his followers in the Roman Catholic Church to care for creation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GPS showed David Morgan still on dry land - but the waves bumping beneath his boat revealed the reality of this lost Louisiana landscape. Rising seas have obliterated 30 points on the map in the last three years at Plaquemines Parish where Morgan lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sugarcane fields, citrus groves, backwoods - all gone. &quot;This was all land here when I was a kid. There was no water anywhere,&quot; said Morgan, 57, slowing the boat to pass oyster beds. &quot;I used to hunt rabbits there with my dog,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louisiana is losing land to the sea faster than anywhere else in the world. But the authorities have a plan to turn back the seas - and get BP to pay a big chunk of the $50bn (&pound;31bn) cost, out of criminal penalties for the blowout of its Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 engineering projects are proposed for the coastline - including diverting the Mississippi river, dumping fresh sand on barrier islands and replanting degraded wetlands. Computer forecasts say Louisiana could start regaining land by 2060 - if all the projects come in on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say the ambitious plan is the best hope for the coast. Louisiana has lost nearly 1,900 square miles of land in 80 years - a football field every hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Plaquemines Parish, the remaining land looks moth-eaten, chewed up by oil industry canals and incoming seawater. Left unchecked, an additional 1,750 square miles could be lost by 2064.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Louisiana's land began vanishing about 80 years ago when the state began penning in the Mississippi after catastrophic floods. The system of levees cut off the river from the delta, choking off the sediment needed to shore up the coast. A decade later, oil drilling took off and industry canals tore up the coastal wetlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising seas under climate&nbsp;change accelerated land loss, exposing New Orleans and oil, shipping and seafood industries to hurricanes and storm surges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea level rise is now the leading cause of land loss, said Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for climate and land use change at the US Geological Survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If sea level rise doubles as we expect over the next century, can you imagine what is going to happen to this landscape?&quot; she said. &quot;Without the barrier islands and marshes to attenuate the storm surge, the people of New Orleans are basically surrounded by an earthen levee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the state's Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, who publicly downplays the dangers of climate&nbsp;change, has committed to the plan to hold back the seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the engineering will be prohibitively expensive. Congress has refused to fund the $50bn and the Louisiana authorities are banking heavily on BP paying a large share of the costs. Under a law passed by Congress, 80% of the penalties obtained from BP following the oil well blowout will go to coastal restoration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a judge in New Orleans last month found BP had exercised &quot;gross negligence&quot; in the runup to the disaster, the firm could be fined as much as $18bn under the Clean Water Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate lawsuit is trying to get oil and gas companies to pay for restoration, because of the damage done by the canals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burkett said the plan was different from failed restoration efforts because it aims to mimic the way sediment, debris and even trees were carried along by the Mississippi and deposited on the delta, extending land into the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;What we have learned through time is restoring the natural process is more effective than building concrete dams and dykes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, engineers are importing sand to rebuild barrier islands scoured by hurricanes. At Pelican Island, a 2.5 mile strip in the Barataria Bay, sand and silt is being used to build dunes and marshes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than $77m so far has been spent on Pelican Island - but that buys just 20 years before it too is devoured by the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the rate of land loss, it's hard to keep pace. &quot;Even though a couple of billion dollars sounds like a lot of money we have found it woefully inadequate to do a lot of good here on the coast that we're looking at,&quot; said Brad Inman, a senior project manager on the restoration project from the Army Corps of Engineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also unclear whether re-engineering the coast can ever work - no matter how massive the scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In research published this year, Richard Condrey, a retired coastal ecologist from Louisiana State University, said this approach was bound to fail. It was time to start again - before it's too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The data doesn't support that putting sand on a barrier island has impacted the rate of loss,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to recognise that what we're doing is not working. We're not protecting the citizens of Louisiana. We are not protecting the coasts and barrier islands . . . We need to stop fooling ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;An eagle-eyed reader noticed that our sums did not quite add up when we said Louisiana had lost nearly 1,900 square miles of land in 80 years and equated that to losing a football field an hour (Engineers ape nature in effort to turn back tide in Louisiana, 15 October, page 22). We had conflated two measurements made over different periods. A paper by US Geological Survey scientists says coastal Louisiana lost nearly 1,900 square miles over the period 1932 to 2010, and that trend analyses from 1985 to 2010 show a wetland loss rate of 16.57 square miles per year - the latter being approximately equivalent to the loss of an area the size of an American football field every hour.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Naomi Klein says climate campaigners should attack capitalism because it already is a popular target. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I interviewed the writer Naomi Klein back in 2011, when she used an article in The Nation to lay out the anti-corporate theme that's now the centerpiece of&nbsp;her new bestseller, &quot;This Changes Everything - Capitalism vs. The Climate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Roberts at Grist has just interviewed her&nbsp;about her book, and his questions deserved much better answers than he got. Here's a video excerpt: [Video:  Watch on YouTube.]Question number one was trenchant and vital. Roberts asked about her choice of villain: &quot;Why capitalism and not extractivism?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She hemmed and hawed for a minute or so, then settled on a line about how climate&nbsp;change campaigns could be energized&nbsp;by&nbsp;focusing on an established enemy of many other factions in society:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think there's a benefit to the climate discussion to name a system that lots of people already have a problem with for other reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just focusing on climate is getting us nowhere. I don't see any genuine signs of progress on that front that bring us in line with science-based targets. I think there's something kind of uninspiring about just the narrow focus on climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She goes on to acknowledge the challenge she faces in trying to end capitalism, and I encourage you to explore the book to get her full prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I haven't finished the book, having been dragged away by the news flow. But the sections I read contained inconsistencies that troubled me - like Klein's call to end free trade (in defense of localism) but support it, too (in defense of China's ability to sell its cheap solar panels as widely as possible). I'm not sure the international community would tolerate a selective approach to &quot;free&quot; trade. You can read an excerpt here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen to her chat with Roberts. As soon as I've finished the book I'll get in touch with Klein to discuss my full views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For divergent views of her book, read Ben Chu's glowing review in The Independent&nbsp;and Will Boisvert's detailed critique on the Breakthrough Institute website.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon on Monday released a report asserting decisively that climate&nbsp;change poses an immediate threat to national security, with increased risks from terrorism, infectious disease, global poverty and food shortages. It also predicted rising demand for military disaster responses as extreme weather creates more global humanitarian crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report lays out a road map to show how the military will adapt to rising sea levels, more violent storms and widespread droughts. The Defense Department will begin by integrating plans for climate&nbsp;change risks across all of its operations, from war games and strategic military planning situations to a rethinking of the movement of supplies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking Monday at a meeting of defense ministers in Peru, highlighted the report's findings and the global security threats of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The loss of glaciers will strain water supplies in several areas of our hemisphere,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''Destruction and devastation from hurricanes can sow the seeds for instability. Droughts and crop failures can leave millions of people without any lifeline, and trigger waves of mass migration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the latest in a series of studies highlighting the national security risks of climate&nbsp;change. But the Pentagon's characterization of it as a present-day threat demanding immediate action represents a significant shift for the military, which has in the past focused on climate&nbsp;change as a future risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before, the Pentagon's response to climate&nbsp;change focused chiefly on preparing military installations to adapt to its effects, like protecting coastal naval bases from rising sea levels. The new report, however, calls on the military to incorporate climate&nbsp;change into broader strategic thinking about high-risk regions -- for example, the ways in which drought and food shortages might set off political unrest in the Middle East and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that the broadened approach would include considering the role that climate&nbsp;change might have played in contributing to the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change and water shortages may have triggered the drought that caused farmers to relocate to Syrian cities and triggered situations where youth were more susceptible to joining extremist groups,'' said Marcus D. King, an expert on climate&nbsp;change and international affairs at George Washington University. The Islamic State, often referred to as ISIS, has seized scarce water resources to enhance its power and influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Pentagon plans for the impact of climate&nbsp;change, it is conducting a survey to assess the vulnerability of its more than 7,000 bases, installations and other facilities. In places like the Hampton Roads region in Virginia, where there is the largest concentration of American military sites, rapidly rising sea levels have led to repeated flooding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new report does not make any specific budget recommendations for how the military will pay for its climate&nbsp;change agenda, but if the Pentagon does request funding from Congress for its initiatives, it will clash with congressional Republicans, many of whom question the established scientific evidence that human activities are causing climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''ISIS is still gaining ground and causing havoc in Syria and Iraq, with foreign fighters from over 80 countries coming and going into the fight and then returning to their home country,'' Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a prominent skeptic on climate&nbsp;change, said of the Pentagon report. ''It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the president and his administration would focus on climate&nbsp;change when there are other, legitimate threats in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon's increased emphasis on the national security threats of climate&nbsp;change is aimed in part at building support for a United Nations agreement, to be signed next year in Paris, that would require the world's largest producers of planet-warming carbon pollution to slash their emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change negotiators from around the world will meet in Peru in December to draft that deal. Mr. Hagel's speech on Monday appeared intended to build support for that effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In two months, the United Nations will convene countries from around the world here in Peru to discuss climate&nbsp;change,'' he said. ''Defense leaders must be part of this global discussion. We must be cleareyed about the security threats presented by climate&nbsp;change, and we must be proactive in addressing them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that Mr. Hagel's increasingly prominent role in pushing for a new global climate&nbsp;change treaty is a sign that the urgency of the issue is starting to drive changes in the political debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997, Mr. Hagel, then a Republican senator from Nebraska, played a crucial role in blocking the United States from taking part in the world's first climate&nbsp;change treaty. He wrote, with Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, a resolution ensuring that the Senate would never ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which required the world's largest economies to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mr. Hagel's efforts to lay the groundwork for a new global climate deal signal a remarkable shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's significant that the secretary is focusing his remarks at the defense ministers' meeting of the Americas on natural disasters and climate&nbsp;change,'' said Sherri W. Goodman, senior vice president at the CNA Corporation. ''His making it a priority among the many other things he has to address -- ISIS, Ebola, Russia -- is a signal that the administration intends to place a priority on this in international climate&nbsp;change negotiations.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We write as senior academics at the University of Glasgow who actively research the decarbonisation of energy to deplore the decision of our university court to divest from fossil fuels (Report, 9 October). The court's position is vacuous posturing, since alternatives to fossil fuels are not yet available at scale for heat and transport, or for electricity production on demand. Indeed, our university has just committed itself to a new gas-fired campus heating system, not least because the only current renewable alternative (biomass) had a far poorer environmental profile. The skills and facilities of the hydrocarbons sector - many of whom are our alumni - are indispensable to the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), without which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considers there is no chance of the world achieving emissions reduction targets. CCS also offers the only sizeable prospect for actively stripping greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, most food consumed in Europe today relies on nitrogen produced from hydrocarbons and they are also the raw materials for the vast array of plastics our society demands - many of which can lock up fossil carbon for centuries. Again, no alternatives yet exist at scale. To pretend otherwise is intellectually dishonest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We trust that those academic colleagues who voted for this gesture have had the moral consistency to turn off the heating in their offices (entirely fossil-fuelled) and to switch off their computers and room lights for the 34.5% of the working day that fossil fuels provide electricity in Scotland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans are investigating whether the Obama administration improperly colluded with a prominent environmental advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, as the Environmental Protection Agency drafted major climate&nbsp;change regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation, begun by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, comes as Republicans continue a long-running effort to block President Obama's climate&nbsp;change agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Issa and Mr. Vitter contend that the environmental group's influence on the Obama climate&nbsp;change rule was inappropriate. Their staff members are investigating whether in drafting the rule the E.P.A. broke the law, specifically the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how agencies write regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed rule, now in a public comment period, would force American power plants to sharply curb carbon emissions, the chief cause of global warming. Mr. Obama announced the rule in June. If enacted, the rule could shutter hundreds of coal-fired power plants and stand as a defining element of Mr. Obama's legacy on fighting climate&nbsp;change. Republicans and the coal industry have attacked it as a ''war on coal'' that will raise energy prices and destroy jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The E.P.A. appears to have a far cozier relationship with N.R.D.C. lobbyists on carbon emission rule-making than with any other stakeholders,'' Mr. Issa said in a statement. ''The N.R.D.C.'s influence on draft E.P.A. regulations raises substantial concerns about blurred lines and inappropriate influence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence, the lawmakers point to a series of friendly emails between the E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy, and employees of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a powerful advocacy group with a long history of using lobbying and lawsuits to shape government policy. The emails show that the environmental group and the E.P.A. worked together on a series of policy and messaging moves meant to advance Mr. Obama's climate&nbsp;change agenda without action from Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say the most vivid example of a cozy relationship is an email exchange between Ms. McCarthy and David Doniger, a lawyer for the environmental group, celebrating legal maneuvering that provided Mr. Obama with something both the E.P.A. and the environmental group wanted: a court-ordered deadline for release of a 2012 E.P.A. regulation curbing greenhouse gas emissions on future power plants -- a precursor to Mr. Obama's announcement in June. (The environmental group had joined with others to sue the E.P.A. to force the regulation, and the E.P.A. quickly settled.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 23, 2010, the day the settlement was announced, Mr. Doniger emailed Ms. McCarthy, ''Thank you for today's announcement. I know how hard you and your team are working to move us forward and keep us on the rails. This announcement is a major achievement.'' He added, ''We'll be with you at every step in the year ahead.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. McCarthy responded, ''Thanks David. I really appreciate your support and patience. Enjoy the holiday. The success is yours as much as mine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the email exchange, Mr. Vitter said in a statement: ''Who is working for whom? The key example in all of this is the settlement agreement on greenhouse gases when the N.R.D.C. sued the E.P.A., the E.P.A. settled, and the two celebrate the agreement. It doesn't get any more blatantly obvious than that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emails were provided to The New York Times by Republican staff members on the Senate environment committee. Mr. Vitter and Mr. Issa said their investigation was prompted by an article in The Times in July that detailed how the Natural Resources Defense Council influenced key elements of the June climate&nbsp;change regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.P.A. officials said that the environmental group did not wield outsize influence in shaping the regulation, and pointed out that the agency sought comments from hundreds of groups, including environmental advocates, state regulators, electric utilities, labor groups, tribes and the coal industry, when preparing the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To imply that one group had any undue influence on the proposal's development is ridiculous and absurd,'' Thomas Reynolds, an E.P.A. spokesman, said in an email. Ed Chen, the council's communications director, said the group was simply doing its job. ''If we weren't trying to motivate the E.P.A., or the White House, to protect public health, we'd be guilty of malpractice,'' Mr. Chen said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the council was suing the Obama administration in order to create the legal requirement for the climate&nbsp;change rule, three of the group's environmental experts were also drafting a proposal for what the rule should look like. The three -- Mr. Doniger, David Hawkins and Daniel Lashof -- produced a 110-page plan, with the explicit aim of offering it to the Obama administration. It was widely viewed by experts as the blueprint for Mr. Obama's climate&nbsp;change rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men had been corresponding with Ms. McCarthy since she was named assistant administrator of the E.P.A. in the first months of the Obama administration. At one point Mr. Lashof, a climate scientist, asked her for a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As the Obama administration seeks to make rapid progress on air pollution, climate and energy, I am uniquely positioned to help forge a workable and effective strategy that combines Clean Air Act implementation and new legislation,'' Mr. Lashof wrote to Ms. McCarthy in March 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. McCarthy wrote back, ''Dan -- anyone who earns such praise from Dale gets on my radar screen.'' She was referring to Dale Bryk, a council staff member. ''It will be good to meet you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Lashof did not take a job with the Obama administration, the work of his team did end up shaping the president's climate&nbsp;change strategy. Over the following year, Mr. Doniger corresponded several times with Ms. McCarthy about the messaging and timing of the agency's work on climate&nbsp;change regulations, including in March 2010, when he wrote to Ms. McCarthy criticizing the E.P.A.'s muted response to a Senate bill that could have blocked or delayed the agency's authority to release climate&nbsp;change rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. McCarthy wrote back, ''Sorry David. We will clear this up. No one is supporting this bill.'' Despite the criticism of Republicans, Ms. McCarthy has won praise throughout her tenure at the E.P.A. for meeting with or listening to a variety of groups, including those in industry, as she drafts major regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we ask for a call or a meeting, they're receptive,'' said John McManus, vice president of American Electric Power, an electric utility that operates in 11 states. ''They do want to hear what industry thinks of this, what states think. E.P.A. got input from a lot of groups.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. McManus noted that N.R.D.C.'s proposals are strongly reflected in the E.P.A.'s plan. ''There are similarities with N.R.D.C's concept,'' he said. ''N.R.D.C. provided a lot of input.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100,000 UK homes could be made carbon neutral in the next five years if the EU approves funding for a groundbreaking green social housing project this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilot projects are due to start within a year on council estates and housing association properties in London, Birmingham and southern England and are expected to save 1,950GWh of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative involves wrapping houses with insulated panel facades that snap on like Lego. Insulated roofs with 24 solar panels are fastened on top, while heat pumps, hot-water tanks and ventilation units are housed in garden sheds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Woonwaard estate near Amsterdam, tenants whose homes have had the upgrade say it is like living in a tea cosy. Former social worker Astrid Andre, 58, told the Guardian: &quot;You can't hear the traffic any more. It feels as if I'm living in a private home, rather than social housing. Before, the wind used to go through the house in winter. I have arthritis and when the weather was colder, it became worse. But my bones are better now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme has won a contract from the Dutch government to provide 10-day makeovers to 111,000 homes on estates built mostly in the 1960s and 70s. It is bidding for euros 10m (&pound;7.9m) from the EU's Horizon 2020 fund to extend the project to the UK and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partners in the bid to bring the Dutch Energiesprong (&quot;Energy Leap&quot;) consortium to the UK include the Greater London authority, the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change, the Housing Finance Corporation and the National Housing Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Netherlands has a head start but the basic logic is the same,&quot; said Jasper van den Munckhof, Energiesprong's director. &quot;If you have political will, government support and a housing association sector that can put up a strong volume for conceptual development, then there is a profitable case for builders to step in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Netherlands, upfront capital comes from the WSW social bank, which has provided euros 6bn to underwrite government-backed 40-year loans to housing associations, which then charge tenants the same amount they had previously paid for rent and energy bills together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prefabricated refurbishments come with a 5.25% return guaranteed to participating housing associations. But the renovations can only be done if all tenants in a block agree, and that spurred an incentive: free bathrooms, fridges and Ikea kitchens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone has been talking about it since last December,&quot; said Bianca Lakeman, a 32-year-old office worker and single mother on the Woonwaard estate. &quot;They're saying how the front facade is very modern but most of all they are talking about the beautiful Ikea kitchens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lakeman's block is due to be renovated this month in the latest construction round on the estate, which will create another 50 zero-energy homes. &quot;I'm very excited about it because it can keep my cost of living under control and reduce the effects of climate&nbsp;change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40% of Europe's carbon dioxide emissions come from heating and lighting in buildings and the EU has set a zero-energy requirement for all new house builds by 2021. But these only make up 1% of the continent's housing stock and persuading the construction industry to renovate to new and untried standards has been difficult. Energiesprong says its programme of building renovations should be seen as a means to a low-carbon transformation of the building sector, rather than an end in itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European commission yesterday gave Britain the green light for a huge government subsidy that will open the way for the first atomic power stations to be built for nearly 20 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling was welcomed by ministers and the nuclear industry but Austria threatened legal action against it, while consumer champions said it could add more than &pound;5bn a year to energy bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of commissioners agreed Britain was not breaking state aid rules, overcoming the last regulatory hurdle for EDF Energy and its plan to construct Hinkley Point C in Somerset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDF believes the project will cost &pound;16bn but the EC claimed construction costs alone by the time the plant is built in 2023 will be more than &pound;24bn with a further possible &pound;10bn of contingency payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joaquin Almunia, EC competition commissioner, had earlier overseen a heavily critical report on the subsidy arrangements drawn up by the UK Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change (DECC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almunia argued that the commission could agree the measures in favour of Hinkley because the subsidy regime had been &quot;significantly modified&quot;, limiting distortions of competition in the single market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British ministers see new nuclear reactors as important to provide low carbon energy when many atomic and coal-fired stations are nearing the end of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subsidy arrangements guarantee the French electricity generator will obtain &pound;92.50 per megawatt hour over the 35-year life of the Hinkley plant. This subsidy, twice the current price of electricity, will be paid out of customer bills, and DECC claims it will represent a significant saving on alternatives such as gas, whose price is expected to rise sharply and which gives off significant carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Davey, the energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary, said the commission decision was a good deal for consumers. &quot;Today's announcement is a boost to our efforts to ensure Britain has secure, affordable low carbon electricity in the 2020s,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hinkley Point C will be able to supply 7% of Britain's electricity and could avoid about 9m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year from fossil fuel-generated power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, said Hinkley set a &quot;bad precedent&quot; because guaranteed payments had previously been reserved for renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar. He said Austria was opposing the decision on economic and environmental grounds, saying nuclear power was not a sustainable form of energy and was not an option for combating climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Butler, a former No 10 energy adviser, said the whole subsidy arrangement was a mistake that would punish consumers and should be investigated by parliament's public accounts committee. &quot;The deal will go down in history . . . as an example of the inability of the British government - ministers and civil servants alike - to negotiate complex commercial deals,&quot; he wrote in a blog for the FT.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's such a distortion of competition rules that the commission has left itself exposed to legal challenges,&quot; said Greenpeace EU legal adviser Andrea Carta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Todd, of price comparison site energyhelpline, said the subsidy &quot;could see UK homes collectively foot the bill for an additional &pound;5.2bn per year&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lord Hutton of Furness, chairman of the British Nuclear Industry Association, said it was an important step in securing Britain's home-grown low-carbon electricity generation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you buy a new car, you dodge the sketchy salesman, read up on consumer ratings, get a feel for the ride. When you get married, you think about growing old with a person, love beyond lust, do a life gut check. And when you elect a federal lawmaker next month, you go against everything you believe in to reward the worst Congress ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How else to explain the confit of conventional wisdom showing that voters are poised to give Republicans control of the Senate, and increase their hold on the House, even though a majority of Americans oppose nearly everything the G.O.P. stands for?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message is: We hate you for your inaction, your partisanship, your nut-job conspiracy theories; now do more of the same. Democracy -- nobody ever said it made sense. Of course, November's election will be a protest vote against the man who isn't on the ballot, a way to make a lame duck president even lamer in his final two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before buyer's remorse sets in, voters should consider exactly what Republicans believe, and what they've promised to do. It ranges from howl-at-the-moon crazy talk and half-truths to policies that will keep wages down and kill job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the Republican Ryan Zinke, a square-jawed former member of the Navy SEALs who is likely to be the next congressman from Montana. Earlier this year, he said, ''We need to focus on the real enemy'' -- that is, the anti-Christ. And who should that be? Why, Hillary Clinton. O.K., he's just one talk-radio spawn from the Big Sky state. Lock the man up in a room with Ayn Rand novels and the tomes of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises and he'll be right in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Zinke is not a lone loon. More than one in five Republicans last year told a pollster they believed that President Obama was the anti-Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's harmless hyperbole, you say. The 114th Congress will not take up the matter of what to do with the Beast at the end times. But they will hold crucial votes on whether one of the world's largest users of energy -- us -- can curb carbon emissions enough to mitigate climate&nbsp;change. Here Mr. Zinke is practically a lefty in his party. He says climate&nbsp;change is not a hoax, which puts him at odds with 58 percent of Republicans who believe that it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, he says that the matter is not ''settled science.'' Oy vey. One more time: 97 percent of climate scientists agree that warming over the last century is very likely because of human activity. It is settled, except in the science-denial party. Only 3 percent of Republicans in Congress have been willing to go on record to accept that consensus. Good thing gravity is not under discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You say you favor raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, as did 73 percent of those polled by Pew. Yay, let's do something about income inequality! But the Republican leadership will not let this come up for a vote. Nope. Never. It's locked in the closet, with compromise. And in Iowa, just to pick one race that could make a huge difference in the lives of millions, the Republican who is close to taking the Senate seat of the retiring Tom Harkin is against raising the federal minimum wage. That would be Joni Ernst, a Koch brothers tool, who has also pledged fealty to the anti-tax absolutism of Grover Norquist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans want their politicians to meet in the middle. Well, most. If you wonder why Republicans will not budge on common-sense issues supported by a majority, it's because the other party supports those ideas. This year, another Pew survey found that 36 percent of Republicans believe the Democratic Party is a threat to the nation's well-being. You don't compromise with a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest issue is the economy. But here, it seems many voters don't know what to believe, and what they do believe is wrong. What's the unemployment rate? A poll this month found that 27 percent of people pegged the jobless rate at 9 percent, and nearly one in five said it was closer to 12 percent. The rate is 5.9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Obama's watch, the stock market went on a record run and 10 million new jobs have been created -- more new jobs than in Europe and Japan combined. The president gets no credit for this, because people don't feel it. Wages are flat. Economic anxiety rides the October air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans have no jobs plan, as Speaker John Boehner indirectly acknowledged this week with a five-point tweet that listed ... nothing. But they talk about austerity and cutting spending, exactly what Europe did to catastrophic effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is one more deep-held red state belief that could explain our national cognitive dissonance. Two-thirds of Republicans think people can be possessed by demons. We don't need a new Congress. We need an exorcist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become fashionable to note a decline of American global power and influence, but don't tell that to the energy experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many see increased domestic production of oil and gas as driving more muscular United States energy diplomacy, power that exists in curious tandem with the Obama administration's efforts to wean the world off fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The rapid rise in U.S. oil and gas production, together with the decline in oil consumption and the elevation of climate&nbsp;change as a priority, is completely scrambling the way policy makers think about energy diplomacy,'' said Michael A. Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard professor who articulated the notion of ''soft power'' in international affairs, sees a ''shale gale'' propelling America's status: ''If you are attracted to a country or any leader, a lot has to do with the feeling, 'Do they have momentum? Is the wind in their sails or are their sails flapping?' We've got a gust.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlos Pascual, a former senior American diplomat, agrees. Increased energy production ''strengthens our hand.'' he said. ''China, when it talks to us about global energy supplies, it sees us as a supplier,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This monumental shift, Mr. Pascual said, allows the United States to cooperate more closely with the world's largest energy consumers to combat climate&nbsp;change -- for example, by persuading them to reduce their heavy reliance on coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we can't work with China on diversifying their fuel mix, then we're all going to die,'' Mr. Pascual said calmly, calling natural gas ''the fuel in the interim that has the greatest prospect for substituting for coal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, which Mr. Pascual ran from its inception in 2011 until last August, is evidence of a brighter spotlight on energy. It has grown from a staff of fewer than 50 to 90 today, with a mission to ''develop, harmonize and promote U.S. energy security overseas,'' according to a State Department document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several federal agencies have increased investments in foreign energy projects in recent years. Some are modest, such as a $750,000 loan by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to an Indian start-up that builds micropower plants run on discarded rice husks. Others are huge: OPIC recently announced $230 million in loan guarantees to construct a 141-megawatt solar power plant in Chile's Atacama Desert, the largest project of its kind in Latin America. On Sept. 23, President Obama issued an executive order that ''requires the integration of climate-resilience considerations into all United States international development work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the United States government remains a big backer of fossil fuel production. The Export-Import Bank of the United States underwrote a $1.5 billion bond guarantee last year, enabling Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex, to patronize United States companies. In 2010, the bank lent $3 billion for a liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea. The project, led by Exxon Mobil, started shipping gas this year to Japan and has contracts with clients in Taiwan and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt many investments abroad are intended to generate economic benefits at home. That's an old story. In the late 19th century, Standard Oil, owned by John D. Rockefeller, ''depended on the State Department to fight for the removal of tariffs and other barriers to the entry of American oil into foreign markets,'' Rosemary A. Kelanic, an assistant professor of political science at Williams College in Massachusetts who studies energy access as a coercion tactic, said by email. In ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.,'' Ron Chernow quotes the oil magnate as saying, ''Our ambassadors and ministers and consuls have aided to push our way into new markets to the utmost corners of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pemex financing arguably continues that tradition, with an estimate that it would support around ''6,800 U.S. jobs spread across about 10 states,'' according to the Export-Import Bank's website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some loans, grants and bond guarantees also serve as attempts to win friends and electrify neighbors. In 2007 the United States Agency for International Development spent $43.8 million for energy services, but that rose to more than $391 million by 2013. OPIC's financing of energy projects soared from $123 million in 2007 to $1.21 billion in 2013, roughly tenfold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Investing in development today means averting instability tomorrow,'' OPIC's president and chief executive, Elizabeth L. Littlefield, said by email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, the State Department's energy bureau forges agreements directly with other countries. In August, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Grenada to provide technical assistance and encourage private investment in sustainable energy technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Nye of Harvard considers the Grenada agreement ''minor,'' he views it as further evidence of America's enhanced status: ''If you want the vote of Grenada in the U.N., and Venezuela is now purchasing it, along with a lot of other Caribbean votes, by subsidized energy, we are now going to be able to compete in that area.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has used its energy resources to play diplomatic hardball. In the summer of 1941, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration slapped licensing requirements on oil exports to Japan, ''which effectively amounted to a complete embargo,'' Victor McFarland, an assistant professor of history at the University of Missouri, said by email. It was the ''first time that access to oil was used as a foreign policy tool on a big scale,'' he added. At the time, the United States accounted for nearly two-thirds of global oil production, but ''rather than restraining Japanese aggression,'' he said, ''the embargo helped push Japan towards war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellen R. Wald, a professor of Middle East history at Jacksonville University, draws parallels between the United States' ascending role as an energy supplier and the postwar period, when the country still ranked as an oil powerhouse. Government officials funneled foreign-bought oil to rebuild Europe as part of the Marshall Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1956, during the Suez crisis, the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower used access to oil to intimidate Britain and France. After Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized the Suez Canal Company in July 1956, Britain and France launched a surprise aerial attack to seize the critical waterway on Oct. 31. (Two days earlier Israel had invaded the Sinai Peninsula in concert with Britain and France.) Furious about being blindsided, the Eisenhower administration stepped up its pressure tactics, weakening the British pound and threatening to withhold oil from Britain and France at a time when both had limited reserves of fuel. The British and French soon relented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the United States wielded its energy policy to achieve geopolitical ends. ''That's something we did do historically,'' Ms. Wald continues, ''and we may be able to do again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems a fair bet. The State Department's energy bureau helped persuade China, India and other countries to reduce imports of Iranian crude oil. The arm-twisting very likely spurred Tehran to freeze its nuclear program last year, though Mr. Pascual, a former ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine, put it more diplomatically. ''We were able to have a different kind of conversation than we could have had even 10 years ago,'' he recalls, providing negotiating partners with an ''analysis of global oil markets: what the trends were in those markets, where supply was coming from -- in particular, from the United States.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists probably have significantly underestimated how much the world's oceans have warmed since the 1970s, according to a new study. The finding may force researchers to revise their gauges of some climate&nbsp;change effects, including the rate of sea-level rise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, by Paul J. Durack of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and others, found that the underestimation was the result of decades of spotty sampling of water temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere, home to three-fifths of the world's oceans. Until 2004, when a worldwide system of autonomous floats, called Argo, became operational, there were relatively few temperature measurements south of the Equator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While atmospheric warming because of the trapping of heat by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has most of the public's attention, the oceans store far more of this heat. The study showed that the amount of heat absorbed by the top 2,200 feet of the oceans from 1970 to the mid-2000s may be as much as 58 percent higher than previously estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We potentially may have missed a fair amount of heat that the ocean has been taking up,'' Dr. Durack said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers looked at global climate models, partitioned between north and south, and found a strong correlation between these simulations and data on sea-surface height as measured by satellites. But the models were not a good match for temperature, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. This suggested that the problem was not with the models so much as with the lack of temperature data before 2004. The study was published Sunday in the journal Nature Climate&nbsp;Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea-level rise linked to climate&nbsp;change is related in part to increased melting of ice sheets and in part to the fact that water expands as it warms. So the finding that more heat has been taken up by the oceans may lead to revisions in estimates of the rate of sea-level rise. The finding also may affect assessments of how sensitive the climate is to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the researchers said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;After a period of decline, The Times is refocusing its attention on climate change.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's hard to dispute the public's dismay over climate&nbsp;change. When hundreds of thousands of people take to the Manhattan streets, as they did in the People's Climate March last month, something big is clearly happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a year ago, the signs weren't particularly good for coverage of the environment in The New York Times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special group (or &quot;pod&quot;) of reporters who had that expertise had been disbanded, and the Green blog had been discontinued. I wrote about it severaltimes, including a column that demonstrated that the amount and quality of coverage had declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, I'm glad to report, things are looking up again. Since the survival of the planet ranks pretty high on my list of what matters, it seems worth noting here exactly what's happening and why.The most notable change is the addition of some heavy-hitting reporters to a team with a newly appointed editor, Adam Bryant. The reporters include John Schwartz, David Kocieniewski, Henry Fountain and Erica Goode. (Ms. Goode, who founded the original environmental team in 2009 and was its editor for two years, will be a science writer at large.) They join Justin Gillis and Michael Wines in New York and Coral Davenport in Washington, as well as Felicity Barringer on the West Coast. &nbsp; In addition, James Gorman has been contributing a multimedia element with his Science Take videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea is that climate&nbsp;change is the biggest story going, and we ought to be on it in a big way,&quot; said the science editor, Barbara Strauch. She said that the idea to beef up the team had come from Jill Abramson, before she was fired last spring, and that the new executive editor, Dean Baquet had put his full weight and considerable enthusiasm behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's made it one of his priorities,&quot; Ms. Strauch said of Mr. Baquet. She described Mr. Bryant as a very strong, experienced editor who, though not an expert in environment coverage, should prove to be a good leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's good at seeing the big thoughts. It helps sometimes not to be an expert,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times has also begun a solutions-oriented series, &quot;The Big Fix,&quot; with more installments on the way. (I had noted, in my previous columns, that there had not been a major series on the environment in some time; that has now been remedied.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To state the obvious, it's an incredibly important story,&quot; Mr. Bryant told me. &quot;There's a lot of opportunity to connect the dots, to ask the big questions.&quot; He said he is looking for &quot;conceptual scoops,&quot; as well as aggressive coverage of hard news on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is well equipped to do so now: &quot;I've got this unbelievable team of reporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reader, Katy Lederer, wrote to me with a potential downside to having many of these reporters work from the science desk. She had noticed, she wrote, &quot;that almost all stories having to do with climate&nbsp;change have been put into the Science section.&quot; &nbsp; She added: &quot;Keeping these stories primarily in the Science section sends a signal to your readers that the phenomenon of climate&nbsp;change is still something to be studied or examined by scientists-some sort of scientific or natural phenomenon-and not something that is human-caused and already affecting our daily lives. Leaving climate&nbsp;change out of relevant stories that appear outside of the Science section sends the same, outdated message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Strauch disagreed with some of Ms. Lederer's observations. &nbsp;She noted, &quot;We recently did a full science section devoted to climate&nbsp;change, but aside from that, stories on this topic appear all over the paper and more often than not, on page one.&quot; &nbsp;Examples include a story on Germany's push into renewable energy, another about scientists linking extreme heat in Australia to climate&nbsp;change, and stories about climate&nbsp;change and the California drought. &nbsp;She also disagreed that putting stories in the science section signals that the science is still debatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she said: &quot;I do agree that we need to do more stories on how climate&nbsp;change is affecting our daily lives. &nbsp;We very much plan on doing more of those stories. &nbsp;And I would imagine that many of those stories will appear in the front section of the paper, as they have already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times's renewed - and in fact, increased - commitment is a most welcome development. &nbsp;I hope that the coverage will be approached with the sense of urgency that this dire situation demands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's consider the walrus crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're piling up in Alaska. About 35,000 walruses have formed what looks to be a humongous brown ball along the northern coast. A mass of critters, some weighing 4,000 pounds, are pressed shoulder to shoulder -- or flipper to flipper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, they'd be sitting on chunks of ice, periodically flopping into the water to hunt for snails and clams. But the ice has melted away, and now they're stuck on land.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the plus side, walruses are gregarious creatures who like to snuggle. The situation is, therefore, less dire than it would be if you had 35,000 extremely large human beings squashed together on a beach, competing for food. But they're nervous. ''A Russian friend of mine said he saw a rabbit -- or a tiny lemming -- come near and it caused a stampede,'' said Margaret Williams of the World Wildlife Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Then the little calves get squished. It's just so unnatural for them to be so close to one another.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe we all would rather see the baby walruses in happier circumstances. Also, this is obviously the sign of worse things to come: melting ice, higher sea levels, warmer oceans, screwed-up weather patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How should we react? Several options:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A) Adopt a walrus family! If every town pitches in, we'll have this solved in a minute. They can eat 6,000 clams in a single meal, so be sure to stock up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B) Take this as a signal to get really serious about global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C) Let's not get carried away. But maybe we could try to cut back on forest fires. Forest fires definitely make things hotter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last one is a somewhat snarky adaptation of the climate-change portion of an energy plan recently unveiled by Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, one of the Republican Party's many, many current presidential hopefuls. Louisiana does not suffer from a walrus problem. However, part of the state is sinking into the sea at a rather rapid rate and you'd think he'd have some strong feelings about global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sirree. Jindal thinks climate&nbsp;change is just a ''Trojan horse'' for leftists who want to mess with freedom of choice. But there is, you know, the forest fire idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'd think that the people in charge of the states where climate&nbsp;change was wreaking the most havoc would be in the forefront of the battle to push it back. But no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Alaska, entire towns are beginning to disappear under the rising seas. Roads are buckling as the permafrost starts to melt. Polar bears, which used to like to hang out on those ice floes themselves, are land bound, hungry and on the prowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, has been forthright about the terrible impact climate&nbsp;change has had, while slightly dodgy about exactly what he wants to do to about it. His opponent, Dan (''the jury's out'') Sullivan isn't sure exactly what the heck is going on. He assured one Alaska newspaper that ''there is no concrete scientific consensus on the extent to which humans contribute to climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, there's a pretty good consensus. A vast, vast majority of climate scientists say that human beings are causing all or part of the changes in climate that are making life miserable for the walrus and destroying the bayou country in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, causing the drains in Miami Beach to back up with saltwater, sending the ocean running down the streets. Florida has its own Republican presidential hopeful in Senator Marco Rubio. ''I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,'' he told ABC News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Jeb Bush is from Florida, too. For the record, Bush's opinion on global warming is that it ''may be real.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when Republicans were leaders in the fight to slow climate&nbsp;change -- particularly for the concept called ''cap and trade,'' which had a marketplace-friendly tilt. Among the co-sponsors of a cap-and-trade bill in 2007 was Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska. Murkoswki had to run for re-election as an independent in 2010, having lost her party's nomination to a Tea Party favorite who complains about ''climate-change alarmists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, it takes courage for a Republican to acknowledge that human beings have anything to do with climate&nbsp;change at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you felt that was a big problem, you would think everybody in the world would be interested in going down this path, but I don't see any evidence of it so far,'' said the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, helpfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed on the issue during a recent interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer, the man who hopes to become majority leader of the Senate next year said staunchly: ''I'm not a scientist.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the record as not being a scientist: Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, and Marco Rubio. Florida is absolutely awash in backed-up ocean water and elected officials who are not scientists. Louisiana has a rapidly receding coastline and a governor who's afraid of the energy industry. Alaska has drowning villages and a political establishment in denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) predicted that we will need to produce 70% more food by 2050, and called for enhanced investment in sustainable agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That pronouncement sparked much debate about the need to build a more sustainable food system. But what do we mean by sustainability? What are the roles of industry, government and consumers? And what are the tools and models we will need?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were some of the questions addressed at a recent roundtable event, hosted by the Guardian in association with Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, and attended by representatives from academia, civil society and private sector organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, Bord Bia announced a plan to get every Irish farmer and food and drink manufacturer signed up to the sustainability agenda. The voluntary &quot;Origin Green&quot; programme requires farmers to undertake regular sustainability assessments, while manufacturers develop multi-annual plans with clear targets in areas such as sourcing, emissions, energy, waste, water and biodiversity, and social sustainability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ireland prides itself on being green,&quot; said Aidan Cotter, chief executive of Bord Bia. &quot;There's a huge world opening up around sustainability, and it's no longer good enough to just talk about it. We have to prove we can do it. So we've set ourselves the goal that, by 2016, every farming and food manufacturing business will be signed up to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roundtable grappled first with the concept of sustainability itself, and how we break it down into something more manageable. For Keith Kenny, head of sustainability at McDonalds, it's defined by what he called the &quot;three Es&quot;: ethics, environment and economic viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we'd had this debate five years ago, there would have been different opinions, but there's more alignment now,&quot; he said. &quot;It's always going to be a balance of those three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within that, there's a further &quot;basket of issues&quot;, according to Hugh Jones, director of the Carbon Trust. &quot;There's a need for better policy and healthier lifestyles at the consumer end,&quot; he said. &quot;Food waste is a big problem, and you need to factor in water and climate change too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Pettigrew, agricultural sustainability manager for Europe at PepsiCo, echoed this sentiment, calling for a systemic approach to the concept. &quot;It's important to take a whole value-chain approach, from production through to consumption,&quot; he said. &quot;There are real challenges of poverty, obesity and inequity across the food system, and tackling it requires collaboration across the value chain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many multinational corporations and large retailers, the sustainability of supply chains has already become an essential part of risk management, as their own long-term future depends on the viability of those who provide their inputs. Earlier this year, for example, the supermarket chain Asda revealed that 95% of its entire fresh produce range is already at risk from climate change. In 2012, confectionery giant Mondelez International launched a $400m &quot;Cocoa Life&quot; sustainability programme to support its cocoa-producing communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us it is about the idea of creating shared value, which has brought a new lens for looking at things,&quot; said Inder Poonaji, head of sustainability at Nestle. &quot;It used to be just economics but now, with more responsible sourcing guidelines, we're looking at how we sustain the communities around these farms in future - because we know that if we don't, they're not going to exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the barriers to sustainability in global value chains is the sheer scale of them, and the difficulty of measuring and standardising within such a broad concept. Nestle uses a tool called Rise (Response-Inducing Sustainability Evaluation), developed by the University of Bern to assess the sustainability of agricultural production at the level of the individual farm, with data analysed against 10 sustainability indicators, including soil use, animal husbandry, nutrient flows and biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More widespread access to basic technology is also proving useful in developing countries, said John Steel, chief executive of Cafedirect. &quot;We've recently launched a technology platform called WeFarm, an SMS-based peer-to-peer learning network for farmers. It means that if farmers see frost on a plant in Kenya, they can post a question through their phone and get an answer about what to do. We're trying to remove the barriers that the chain puts in the way, and make it more collaborative at grassroots level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A multitude of certification schemes have also emerged over the years, aimed at making value chains more equitable, for producers in developing countries in particular. However, many at the roundtable suggested certification in the food and drink sector has become unwieldy - the Ecolabel Index currently lists 148 labels for the food sector alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see it as industry-filtered, with some civil society filtering too, but you've basically got a patchwork quilt with lots of initiatives and gaps. This is where state agency becomes really important,&quot; said David Barling, reader in food policy at City University, London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some consumers feel confident interpreting the various kitemarks, most would prefer to outsource responsibility for sustainable choices to the retailers who still sell us the majority of our food, said Cotter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers expect food on the shelves to be produced sustainably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Hess, reader in water management at Cranfield University, agreed that supermarkets have come to play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to sustainability. &quot;Most consumers are making choices through where they buy from, thinking that if they shop from a particular place they will do the right thing, and if they go to another place it will be cheap,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while some retailers compete on sustainable credentials, there was a consensus at the roundtable that achieving a step-change in sustainable food depends on greater pre-competitive collaboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (WRAP) was held up as one good example, having initiated the Courtauld Commitment under which food and drink businesses including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Unilever and Nestle have committed to work together to reduce food, packaging and supply-chain waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drive towards sustainability is often channelled through specific routes - labelling, diets, retailer commitments, or global commodity roundtables, such as that for beef, but there are other methods too, said Mark Driscoll, head of food at Forum for the Future, who described some early-stage work his organisation has been doing with the UN Global Compact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is about moving beyond the farm-by-farm approach, and looking at more regional or country-based approaches, linking businesses, communities and civil society organisations. How can we provide the tools and techniques for local decision makers to really make sustainable agriculture mainstream? It's a challenge, and we'll need to think slightly more out of the box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the greatest challenge is still achieving the third &quot;E&quot;: economic viability. As Justin McCarthy, editor of the Irish Farmers Journal pointed out, farmers are in the worst position. &quot;They're in the middle. Their inputs - such as fertilisers - are controlled by three or four large companies, and then there's a concentrated network of processors and retailers at the other end that sets the price. It puts a huge squeeze on their profitability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, as McCarthy pointed out, retailers respond to what consumers (and shareholders) want. Low prices is one thing they certainly want and, according to Melissa Barrett, director of sustainability services at Accenture, grasping their social, ethical and environmental values will be an even bigger challenge in years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done research on what we call tomorrow's consumers, and the movement of information with younger generations is so fast, and no longer just about identifying with a sustainability label,&quot; she said. &quot;It's about what links into my values at the time, and what my peers are communicating about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more sustainable food industry is certainly achievable, but as McDonald's' Kenny pointed out, sustainability is a moving target. &quot;We know what best practice is now, but we'll know more next year. It's not a destination - it's a journey, and we have to keep moving.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;An author of a commentary questioning the value of a hard danger threshold for planetary temperature defends his views. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Nature published &quot;Climate policy: Ditch the 2 &deg;C warming goal,&quot; a commentary criticizing the widely adopted threshold for climate safety and offering a new approach to characterizing risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piece, written by David Victor and Charles Kennel, both affiliated with the University of California, San Diego, was quickly challenged by Stefan Rahmstorf on the Realclimate blog and Joe Romm at the Center for American Progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rahmstorf's detailed discussion of the history of the 2-degree limit and the science used to support it is well worth reading. Romm's argument is similar, but cheapened by a preamble that includes not-so-subtle efforts to imply that Victor and Kennel are not legitimate voices on such an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's odd given that Victor was a lead author of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change report on mitigation options for greenhouse gases and is the author of &quot;Global Warming Gridlock,&quot; an influential book on climate&nbsp;change policy. Kennel is hardly a lightweight, either. As with the veteran climate scientist James E. Hansen, Kennel's focus on global warming grew out of a background in astrophysics, but he's been working at the interface of earth science and policy since he became the director of NASA's Mission to Earth program during the Carter administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sent links to the critiques to Kennel and Victor and Victor sent a detailed response yesterday. You can read it below (I recommend taking the weekend; it's long) with some links added and some of the unavoidable jargon unpacked a bit: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, before digging into the substance, I think it is deeply disturbing that both these posts use the same tactics that are often decried of the far right-of slamming people personally with codewords like &quot;political scientist&quot; and &quot;retired astrophysicist&quot; to dismiss us as irrelevant to the commentary on a matter that is for climatologists. Other scientists, by contrast, are &quot;internationally renowned&quot; (quote by Joe) implying somehow that we are peripheral thinkers. People can say what they like about us, but we have not been irresponsible unqualified hacks weighing in on this matter. Getting serious about goals requires working across disciplines-especially between the natural sciences and the social sciences, which are about human behavior (which is what, ultimately, these goals are trying to change). The failure to do that effectively is one of the reasons why climate science hasn't been more directly linked to policy. And that is precisely why we are working as a team across disciplines and why I have devoted a whole career reading and working at the frontier of multiple disciplines. In late August there was a big &quot;Charlie Fest&quot; here at UCSD [link] to celebrate Charlie's life work-and that event, spread over two days, covered at least a dozen disciplines. So come on guys-don't slip into ad hominem slams and narrow views of what kind of science is really needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason that elements of the climate&nbsp;change debate take on religious proportions-by the activists for and against policy-is that folks have so dug in around almost every aspect of the debate that it is hard to raise a question about some uncritically accepted element of the religious canon without folks first attacking you as an untrained heathen. The reality is that MOST of the debate about goals should centrally involve the social sciences-more on that below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's turn to the substance. The arguments in these two posts are far-ranging. I think I have boiled them down to all the main elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMPLEXITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of these posts seem to favor a single simple goal. According to Joe Romm, &quot;...adding more vital signs just gives people more things to argue about. Indeed, the whole Victor and Kennel approach would be an excuse for more dawdling.&quot; And Stefan says &quot;...but to be practical, there cannot be many ... goals-one needs to agree on a single indicator that covers the multitude risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's completely wrong and ignores our central argument. I would be surprised if anything as complex and multifaceted as the climate system could be boiled down to a single crisp goal. And being practical requires realizing that it is important to set goals that reflect the variety of long-term indicators as well as short-term milestones and indicators. This is where a little bit of political science is helpful. I can't think of any complex regulatory function that is performed according to single indicators. Central bankers don't behave this way when they set (unilaterally and in coordination) interest rates and make other interventions in the economy. Trade policy isn't organized this way. In our article we use the example of the Millennium Development Goals because that example is perhaps closest to what the UN-oriented policy communities know-again, multiple goals, many indicators. That's exactly what's needed on climate. Essentially all the evidence from the real world of policy coordination points to the need for goals that reflect the diversity of the phenomena that we are trying to manage as well as indicators that are rooted in what real firms and governments can actually deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW 2 DEGREES GOT ADOPTED AND ITS SCIENTIFIC BASIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both posts seem to be upset that we have not given a more detailed tour of how the 2 degree goal got adopted and make the claim that this number came out of the science. In our essay, we were allowed 2 paragraphs to tour that horizon. So we made three brief points. First, the original formulation for Article 2 [the section of the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate&nbsp;Change (UNFCCC) stating&nbsp;the goal of avoiding &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference&quot; with the climate; useful background here ] carefully did not focus diplomats on a single number or metric. (Small world that it is, I was actually in the room in New York when most of that text was negotiated-visiting as an observer when I was a graduate student at M.I.T.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led to an explicit effort, launched by the UNFCCC and including a high profile meeting in Fortaleza, Brazil, to figure out what Article 2 actually meant. Those efforts led nowhere because scientists, wisely, could not agree on single indicators. To me it is astonishing that both of these posts seem to take us to task for not being aware of the &quot;planetary boundaries&quot; research (more on that below) when the central conclusion from that work is that real boundaries need to be set in multiple dimensions-exactly what we argue. Similarly, the famous &quot;burning embers&quot; figure from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC)&nbsp;says exactly the same thing-if it is some natural ecosystems that you care about then we are already way past the point of no return, if it is Greenland or parts of West Antarctica then the &quot;guardrail&quot; is different (but also, it seems, beyond us). And so on. The fact that different perspectives leads to different types of goals is intrinsic to the nature of the climate system and to the political system that must accommodate lots of different points of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we make the point that what drove 2 degrees was a political movement. All this multidimensionality and complexity of the real science of climate impacts was really inconvenient for activists who, understandably, were trying to get governments to stop dawdling. And it is out of that pressure-the desire for simple, single numbers that could be used to drive climate policy that 2 degrees emerged. First in Europe because Europe was doing more on climate policy than any other region in the world. And then, mainly with European and nongovernmental organization&nbsp;pressure, the goal was spread via the G8 and eventually the UNFCCC into other parts of the world as well. We were allowed 10 citations for the whole article. We spent one of those citations (our reference 3) on a short essay that documents this political origin. We purposely did NOT cite the huge scientific literature that has, ex post, been used to justify 2 degrees because when you look back on that history it isn't the science that drove this and any serious look at the science points to the fact that there are multiple possible goals. The science was broadly consistent with goals like 2 degrees, but it was broadly consistent with lots of other goals as well. But what really drove the adoption of 2 degrees was the desire for a simple &quot;tote board&quot; number that could be used to drive policy. If I were an activist working in Europe pushing for climate policy at the time and pushing the G8 and others to stop dawdling I would have done the same thing. (Personally, I have been heavily influenced by an essay by Marc Levy that looked at how a similar process led to political focal points in the European debate over acid rain. [link] We cite that piece in the long version of our essay that we submitted to Nature-it got cut though, along with 36 other citations.) Third, we are not unaware of the avalanche of scientific literature that has been stitched together in favor of 2 degrees-such as the work in AR4, the &quot;400 page book&quot; [links added] and a multitude of other meetings and communiques. Mention of all this work is tossed around in these posts as if to imply that we are somehow morons for being unaware of all the science that has been shoehorned into the 2-degree debate. Our point is that the scientific community should not be lulled into thinking that it drove this number or that any single number would, in fact, be the right way to think about this problem. The reason it is important to get this story right is not so that the right community gets &quot;credit&quot; for focusing on 2 degrees but so that we can understand how the scientific community has allowed itself to get lulled into thinking that it is contributing to serious goal-setting when, in fact, we have actually not done our jobs properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is very easy to mis-read this history and to mis-read the legal documents that are carefully designed to create the impression that these numbers come straight out of science. For example, Stefan quotes paragraph 4 of the official decision (1/CP.16) in Cancun [the 2010 round of treaty negotiations; link ] that supposedly adopts the 2-degree goal. His full quote says: &quot;...to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2 oC above pre-industrial levels.&quot; But if you go read the actual full decision-which is the ONLY way that carefully negotiated legal texts like this can be read accurately-you see that this statement comes from a pre-ambular paragraph that begins with the phrase &quot;further recognizes.&quot; Statements that are &quot;recognizing&quot; are designed to set context for an agreement-and usually they are negotiated through a process by which some parties want a strong statement in this domain and others don't and so the agreement to disagree takes this artful form. Note that in the construction of the legal decision this paragraph comes BEFORE the text that states what the parties actually &quot;agree&quot; to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not saying that some parties don't want 2 degrees as the goal. I am saying that other parties don't want that goal and that the zone of actual agreement is much narrower. But this has been the game all along-the people who want simple indicators get agreement in one friendly forum and then they move up the agenda, step by step, in other forums until other countries relent or forget or the text gets inserted into some paragraph where countries are less concerned about their disagreement (e.g., paragraph 4). In fact, in that very same paragraph from which Stefan plucks his quote there is careful language avoiding the statement that parties &quot;must&quot; immediately cut emissions but, instead, it says &quot;...with a view to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions...&quot; So that is what was actually adopted in Cancun. &quot;With a view&quot; isn't exactly language that sends the whole planet in lockstep to make 80% cuts in emissions. Incidentally, this kind of inflexibility in language is one reason why I (and many other people) have been more interested in agreements that aren't legally binding-not because we want to let governments off the hook but because binding law brings a lot of baggage with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDRAILS AND BOUNDARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the big disconnects in this whole debate revolves around the word &quot;guardrails&quot; (which Stefan uses) or more generally on &quot;boundaries&quot; (which is widely used). For several decades, the natural science research related to goals has proceeded around the idea that we can identify particular limits in Nature and then work backwards to compute what humans are allowed to do. Research efforts on concepts like &quot;tolerable windows&quot; and &quot;pathways&quot; and &quot;allowable carbon budgets&quot; and the such are all rooted in this notion. In Stefan's words: &quot;Once an overall long-term goal has been defined, it is a matter of science to determine what emissions trajectories are compatible...&quot; By separating the decision on &quot;long-term&quot; goal from the &quot;matter of science&quot; to turn the crank and determine trajectories misunderstands how real goals function in nearly every area of complex and expensive policy coordination. Once again, this is an area where a little bit of insight from other disciplines can help explain how the real world works. If you take seriously the elegant argument made by Bill McKibben many years ago in his lovely &quot;The End of Nature&quot; then we are already past any limit. If you want to protect some of Nature in its pristine state then no globally mixed polluting gas can be allowed. I see Bill's original work and some related work in political philosophy, such as Peter Singer's work, as a debate about the value of nature and the willingness of humans to intervene and manage nature. (Similar questions come up in geoengineering, through which we become even more active managers of nature.) We have to have that debate, and nearly all formulations that start with nature end up with a different way of setting goals. But almost nobody, at least today, is willing to bear the cost of taking such goals seriously. That means that for nearly everyone, the question of goals is deeply intertwined with ultimate impacts, adaptability and costs. Very quickly we can see that matter of goal-setting isn't some abstract number that is a guardrail but it is bound up in our assessments of risk and of willingness to pay for abatement as well as bear risk. And those calculations aren't global-where we start with a single number and work backwards turning some single master science crank-but vary by political group because people see risks differently. That's one of the many reasons why international climate policy is so complex and why real world goal setting doesn't start with single numbers and work backwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This does not seem to be a central critique of Joe and Stefan against our piece, but I outline this issue here because there is a falseness in the way the whole climate science community has posed the goal-setting and crank-turning debate. And a lot of this falseness is rooted in a divide between the academic disciplines. Much of the natural science world has a view of politics that starts with experts setting goals and turning the science crank to compute what governments must do. Much of the social sciences, including political science in particular, sees the process basically in reverse order-with governments determining their interests (often with expert inputs) and then global &quot;solutions&quot; emerging from that decentralized process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PAUSE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both posts seem to be upset with our discussion of the &quot;pause.&quot; Stefan says our discussion of the pause is disingenuous because we &quot;pick 1998 as start year.&quot; By implication, if we had not been disingenuous then global mean temperature would be just fine as an indicator. And Joe says &quot;global [surface] temperature is a perfectly reasonable indicator of planetary health.&quot; Joe's zinger also labels our work &quot;beyond dubious.&quot; Michael Oppenheimer has sent a rebuttal to Nature making similar arguments in defense of global mean temperature. Our point was not to focus on 1998; in fact, in the longer version of our article that we sent to Nature we talk explicitly (and cite heavily) the work that has pinned the &quot;pause&quot; to shifts in El Nino/La Nina cycles and we also prominently mention the high latitude warming. Nature cut that stuff because this is a commentary piece focused on policy implications, not a dissertation on the underlying science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might be that a basket of vital indicators includes global mean surface temperature along with other indicators. But why focus on a global mean that is known to have only a sluggish relationship to real human stress-especially over the sub-decadal time periods that are relevant to most human decision-making-rather than other indicators that are more tightly coupled and better canaries? Joe Romm attacks us because we &quot;perpetuate the myth&quot; that there has been a pause. And then Joe goes on to point out that one possible explanation for the pause is measurement-there's been a ton of warming in the Arctic as if we are somehow hiding that fact when we talk about the pause. Yet we say exactly the same thing-in a whole paragraph we devote to the fact that high latitude temperatures are better indicators of stress than globally averaged temperatures. Joe cites to a very recent article that re-estimates global mean temperature in two ways that might offset some of the bias for under-sampling the arctic in one existing global data set. We cite to a different article that focuses on the rapidly building climate stress in the Arctic. So what's the beef here that leads us to be &quot;beyond dubious&quot;? Both of these lines of thinking point to a) the need for more attention to the real canaries as indicators; and b) the possible improvement in global indicators, including global mean temperature. Nobody disagrees with that. At the same time, all of us need to be very clear that each of these indicators and measurement strategies has flaws. Indeed, there's a world of difference between citing one paper that has done something that MIGHT rebalance the global mean temperature data-as Joe's post suggests-and then assuming that the problem is fixed and the indicator remains the first best only way to measure global goals despite the fact that natural variability in the global mean surface temperature will also make that a sluggish measure. Maybe as those adjustments are done that the global basket of vital indicators should include an improved measure of global mean temperature along with other indicators. Maybe it would be better just to focus on the more sensitive indicators-as we imply. Hashing out the merits and demerits of different indicators would be one purpose of the plan we outline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCEAN HEAT CONTENT AND EXTREME IMPACTS ARE JUNK GOALS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stefan seems to be upset about our favoring ocean heat content (OHC) and extreme events. He plucks out of context a sentence about OHC while ignoring the central argument we are making about that indicator-which is that if most of the heat is going into the oceans and we now have substantially better ways to measure OHC then why not use that measure. So far, the data suggest it is a more responsive measure, but of course OHC alone is inadequate-not least because of coverage issues that are even worse than the GMT [global mean temperature] data sets. And he takes us to task for advocating a &quot;volatility index&quot; that would be based on extreme impacts because, he says, that index would be more volatile than global temperature. But that's not why we advocate looking at extremes. We advocate including extreme events in the global planetary health indicators because extreme events have a particularly large impact on human and natural ecosystems-and that's what, ultimately, people care about most. We are attracted to the work that Jim Hansen and colleagues have published (which we cite), but there are other approaches as well. There are huge problems with getting unbiased measures of extreme events-especially events linked to actual impacts on humans and nature. But with an incentive to improve those measures improvements will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCENTRATION INDICATORS ARE BETTER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suggest in our article that better goals would be more closely linked to what humans actually emit. We suggest that means setting some goals in terms of concentrations (or, even better perhaps, radiative forcing). Stefan and Michael Oppenheimer take us to task for favoring goals that are more remote from ultimate impacts. Oppenheimer's summary of the debate is the best: &quot;[Global Mean Temperature, GMT] is indeed 'related only probabilistically to emissions' (quoting us) but CO2 concentration ... is related only probabilistically to impacts and risks (excepting ocean acidification), which is a primary reason why GMT has been favored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, I'll set aside why GMT has been favored politically-as I covered that above. But Oppenheimer has summarized the essence of the debate and the issue of how one designs goals. Stefan favors goals that have already baked into them the climate sensitivity (i.e., temperature goals). I assume that is because he is thinking about climate&nbsp;change as a climatologist. We favor a basket of vital signs that would likely include impact-oriented goals (perhaps GMT, although high latitude temperatures are probably better indicators) as well as goals that are more closely connected to what governments, firms, and humans actually do. That's because we are thinking about this question from the perspective of how goals actually affect the behavior of institutions (e.g., governments, firms) and people. This is a crucial debate to have-and one that must involve people who are real experts on how goals actually affect human behavior. We have used the example of the Millennium Development Goals [link] because our read of that literature is that abstract goals that may be well rooted in ultimate impacts are not what inspire actual changes in human behavior. One lesson from the MDG experience is that goals need to be linked to indicators that actually change in direct response to human intervention on a time scale of a few years. There are lots of other lessons from that experience and a host of other areas where society has set goals-some effective, others not. So let's have that debate, but it must be done in terms that are serious about how goals have real impacts-not by simply declaring that the climate science knows what goals are best for the climate and everyone should therefore fall into line. The diplomats have been doing that for decades and people haven't fallen into line. Strangely, neither of these posts deals in any detailed way with what is the centerpiece of this debate: how do goals actually work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO DEGREES IS FEASIBLE AND AFFORDABLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both posts perpetuate this myth that the scientific literature says that 2 degrees is inexpensive and achievable. The real answer is that 2 degrees might be achievable, but only under heroic assumptions and efforts. Stefan says that our claim that the 2 degree limit is &quot;effectively unachievable&quot; is [solely supported] by self-reference to a study I wrote. That study was a book length, massively peer reviewed analysis of what's happened with emissions and was hardly the only thing written on this topic. [link] In fact, that book has 71 pages&nbsp;of references to supporting material. Moreover, two sentences after this supposedly gratuitous self-citation we cite the massive IPCC review of these studies (chapter 6 of the IPCC WG3 report) [link] and the sentence after that cites another IPCC chapter (1) that documents in some detail the assumptions that drive the model results that lead to the conclusion that 2 degrees is feasible and cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having taken us to task for somehow not properly handling the uncertainties in climate science-an error we did not commit, as I document above-he then proceeds to offer a horrifically misleading summary of what the IPCC actually found about the achievability and cost of meeting the 2 degree goal. He cites the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) from IPCC Working Group 3 and plucks from that summary the statistic that the reduction in economic growth would be just 0.06%. This 0.06 number comes from column 4 of table SPM.2, which reports the median result from scenarios that stabilize concentrations at about 450 ppm [parts per million] CO2-equivalents. [link]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Note that the economics community has been much more comfortable with concentration targets for the same reason we advocate them-they are more closely connected to what humans actually do. Climatologists like global temperature because it is linked closely to what they study. But people who study humans find that extra step toward global temperature to be a real problem because it explodes the error bars around the results. You can see the effect of that extra layer of propagating uncertainty in column 8 and the orange sections of table SPM.1.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By focusing on this number, we get a totally misleading picture of what the science actually says. That's because Stefan ignores the heading on that column of table from which he plucks the 0.06% number. That heading says: &quot;Consumption Losses in Cost-Effective Scenarios&quot; along with a footnote that explains what cost-effective means. The key to understanding this result lies in the headline and the footnote. It turns out that I was centrally involved with writing the SPM, having devoted much of the last three years of my life as a volunteer for the IPCC and so I have a pretty good sense of what's &quot;in&quot; the SPM and crucially what's &quot;out.&quot; And that's why Charlie and I cited the actual underlying scientific report (chapter 6) along with a detailed discussion of the assumptions that drive those results (chapter 1) rather than citing the SPM-because chapters 6 and 1 tell us a lot more about the actual state of the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that you get 0.06% drop in economic growth only under ideal circumstances-for example, all countries cooperate (pretty much instantly) and all technologies are deployed optimally and globally. That's a fun scenario to talk about, but it bears no relationship to the real world. That's why the SPM includes the orange columns in the middle of table SPM.2 and the blue columns on the right side of that same table-along with results by sector reported in SPM.7 that show the effect of sub-perfect assumptions about technology. And it is why chapters 1 and 6 talk a LOT more about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the real world there will be imperfections and thus idealized cost-effective scenarios in these models don't really tell us much that is useful. One of the most important improvements in climate&nbsp;change economic system modeling in the last five years has been to understand how those imperfect &quot;second best&quot; worlds actually unfold. Some of those imperfections might lead to lower costs; most of them drive costs up-and as this work advances it points to MUCH higher potential costs. Chapter 6 unpacks this in detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this work is just beginning, one thing is clear is that the models are very sensitive to assumptions about a few pivotal technologies. In particular, these models love a technology called &quot;bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS)&quot; because it has negative emissions-you grow biomass, harvest it and burn it for electricity, and then store the pollution underground. Voila. The models love this-especially when the models are told to meet a very aggressive and difficult constraint like stopping warming at a concentration such as 450 ppm which has a decent change of stopping warming at 2 degrees. Facing that constraint, the models pour money into BECCS on the assumption that costs will go down and then, as costs come down, the technology is assumed to spread rapidly and ubiquitously. Indeed, the models that are responsible for essentially all of the 450 ppm scenarios rely massively on BECCS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in the real world, there are zero BECCS plants in existence today and no sane firm is planning any serious investment in the technology because of the terrifying costs and regulatory risks. A few years ago the models loved a CCS technology fired with coal, but in the real world coal CCS has barely taken off as well. If you restrict CCS then the models love nuclear power, but in the real world there are limits on nuclear. Some models love renewables; others don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you start telling the models about the real world the costs go up by a factor of up to 3-probably a lot more, but we don't know because the solution space with multiple real world constraints hasn't been fully explored in the scientific literature yet. (Look at the small N numbers in the orange section of table SPM.2). In fact, many of the models simply can't compute 450 ppm limits (i.e., they blow through 2 degrees) when you add real world constraints. Some of these insights are evident in the SPM that Stefan cites-for example, see the paragraph on p.14-but conveniently Stefan only quotes the idealized 0.06% number when he says that the &quot;vast majority of scientific literature&quot; says that 2 degrees is achievable with just a &quot;minor delay in economic growth&quot;. When you look at real world scenarios, including studies that look at actual trajectories in emissions compared with the cuts needed for 2 degrees (see, for example, figure SPM.5, left panel or the very influential Peters et al 2012 article) a totally different picture emerges. We are not on track-even with the Copenhagen pledges-to come anywhere close to the near-term windows that are consistent with long-term limits of 2 degrees. In fact, the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the scientific literature doesn't even compute 450 ppm because it is so hard to reach. Look at the &quot;N&quot; numbers on table SPM.2. There are only 14 runs that are used to create the 0.06% number. (Technical point: this is not the &quot;best&quot; estimate, as Stefan quotes, but just a central estimate. There aren't enough model runs to do a serious &quot;best&quot; analysis.) When you look at the less aggressive scenarios, which are still hard for the models to generate, the number of feasible runs goes way up. For example, 550 ppm has become a benchmark scenario; it has 46 runs. If you want to know what the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the scientific literature actually says then look at 550.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that is what the literature actually says. And the conclusion from that work is totally different from what Stefan says and completely in line with our characterization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ARE SAYING NOTHING NEW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people seem to be upset about the article because, actually, we aren't saying anything new. There are various passing citations in Joe and Stefan's article to other research that has also made the point about the need for multiple indicators-including, notably, the planetary boundaries studies (Rockstrom et al, 2009). Our essay is a 2,000-word commentary on a pressing global problem, not a radically new piece of scientific research. We don't claim that we are the first to say all this-in fact, the original submission to Nature, which I attach [posted separately], had nearly 50 citations to other studies, including some that have looked at different strategies for setting vital signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what's needed is a fresh look at where this literature stands and what it means for policy-that's why we wrote our article and why we think it is no longer possible to ignore the realities about the problems with the 2 degree goal. I apologize to all of you who were cited along the way (Nature capped us at 10 citations), and in the last 12 hours I have received at least a dozen emails from people saying &quot;nice piece, but we already said all this already.&quot; One guy sent me links to nine articles and books. What's different about our piece is the effort to look beyond the simplistic 2-degree number to a process that could deliver better goals-and to explain why we must not dawdle further and how goals, in the real world, can work best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are mindful of the Rockstrom et al 2009 work, but we didn't dwell on it in this piece because our article is about the global climate problem. The planetary boundaries efforts are much broader and, frankly, run into bigger troubles with comparability across dimensions-something that has come out in the Nature published commentaries on those studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ARE TRYING TO SABOTAGE PARIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, I want to address the claim that we are saboteurs of real progress. Stefan makes that argument forcefully- implying that our attack on &quot;finally agreed foundation&quot; of 2 degrees is an ideal way to sabotage Paris [the 2015 round of climate treaty negotiations]. Joe repeats that attack and also adds the zinger: &quot;Instead of trying to get the world's leading governments to agree on the commitments needed to avoid crossing the 2&deg;C target, let's just ask them to agree on a 'path for designing' some new targets. So long Miami, New Orleans, and other coastal cities - it's been good to know you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am quite familiar with these tactics as someone who said, very early in the debate, that the Kyoto style approach to negotiating binding targets and timetables would never work. Back then, the attack was that we didn't have time to focus on other options because that would be distracting to governments and we should double down on Kyoto. My argument, then and now, is don't double down on things that aren't working. Typically, such attacks then hang on your head the guilt for any climatic disasters that would follow if governments were to pause and take a breath and think rather than just doubling down. That why, I assume, Charlie and I are now responsible for the populations of sub-sea level cities. Stefan says &quot;nobody in their right mind would aim to warm the climate by 2 degrees C.,&quot; which seems to imply that we are happy to see the planet blow through this goal. This is not only logically erroneous, it ignores the reality that building an effective system of management of the climate is a long-term process. If you make mistakes early on in building the right institutions it is important to fix them because institutions have path dependence. Witness the nearly two decades spent on the convention/protocol model that was, in my view, a lot of wasted time because it was obvious that better institutional models would be more effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, finally, we are moving to a more &quot;bottom up&quot; system-in part because of research that showed why the top-down, binding convention/protocol system wouldn't work. There are lots of reasonable disagreements to be had along the way, but pretending that those disagreements don't exist-even though the social science literature in this area shows that they do-is no way to create effective policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie and I did NOT say that in Paris governments should &quot;just&quot; agree on a path for designing new vital signs. We said exactly the opposite of that. We said: &quot;Getting serious about climate&nbsp;change requires wrangling about the cost of emissions goals, sharing the burdens and drawing up international funding mechanisms. But diplomats must move beyond the 2oC goal. Scientists must help them understand why, and what should replace it. New indicators will not be ready for the Paris meeting, but a path for designing them should be agreed there....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have said, starkly, that the core Paris agenda-emission cuts, burden-sharing, financing and the like-are critical. And we have said that Paris should ALSO launch a process to work seriously on goals, which is hardly a radical claim since the Cancun agreement quoted by Stefan above calls for the same thing. This time, though, we need to look at the very long term as well as the near term and come up with a better package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a good National Geographic piece on the 2-degree debate by Michelle Nijhuis. I encourage you to consider Victor's defense in the context of &quot;A Blueprint to End Paralysis Over Global Action on Climate,&quot; an invaluable policy-oriented essay by former senators Timothy E. Wirth and Thomas A. Daschle in Yale Environment 360.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also relevant is my 2010 post, &quot;Get Ready for (Soft) Climate Diplomacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written in the past about other issues related to setting a numerical limit for climate dangers given both the enduring uncertainty around the most important climate&nbsp;change questions and the big body of science pointing to a gradient of risks rising with temperature.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Seven climate-focused people explain how they sustain their energy and enthusiasm. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The folks at Audubon Magazine, who recently sought my thoughts for a special issue on global warming, also asked me and six other people engaged on making progress on different facets of the issue what our &quot;personal strategies are for keeping pessimism at bay.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click here for contributions from&nbsp;the others, including the long-distance climate campaigner Bill McKibben, the climate scientist Heidi Cullen and two biologists from the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. Here's my contribution (the version posted by Audubon was necessarily shortened to fit with the others): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges ahead are truly daunting, but I see encouraging news on both social and ecological fronts. Here are just two. There's a growing body of evidence that species in vulnerable situations are far more able to withstand or adjust to climate extremes than once thought - from&nbsp;California butterflies to Pacific corals, if given some space and limiting other pressures.&nbsp;The new International Union on Conservation of Nature report on Caribbean coral conservation&nbsp;described great opportunities to protect reefs with fairly simple steps, even as it found climate&nbsp;change to be less of a threat than some feared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for social progress, if a small Philippine island community can move ahead with family planning projects amid opposition from the Catholic Church,&nbsp;as Sam Eaton reported so effectively recently, anything is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for personal sustainability, I'm always &quot;skating away on the thin ice of a new day,&quot; as Jethro Tull so aptly put it way back when I was a freshman in college. It's tough, particularly in the 24/7 media environment. For me,&nbsp;my&nbsp;music and songwriting&nbsp;are the main tonic, directing&nbsp;my&nbsp;energies to themes that journalism doesn't cover much. But it's hard to find time even for that these days. That's when the walks in the woods out our door come in. But, of course, even there I end up stumbling on issues that must be blogged - like&nbsp;the new face of litter in the 21st century.&nbsp;Where's&nbsp;my&nbsp;guitar?!                       </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the observation tower in the Thar desert the dark blue arrays of a million solar panels can be seen sitting silently on the red dust. The Charanka solar park in Gujarat is an &quot;ultra-mega&quot; power project - the Indian government's phrase - and the biggest in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike the hundreds of coal plants and their noxious smokestacks being built in the country, the only danger linked to the solar panels are the snakes and scorpions that scuttle between the sparse shrubs, posing a minor hazard to those who dust off the panels after dusk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But today, God is doing the cleaning,&quot; says Poojan Ghodadra, programme manager for SunEdison, as rare rain bounces off the panels. SunEdison has provided about a 10th of the 221MW total in the 5,000-acre solar park.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was the brainchild of Narendra Modi. As chief minister of Gujarat, Modi spurred companies to build more than 900MW of solar plant across the state in just a couple of years. Now, as prime minister, the question is whether he can repeat the feat across India, which receives more sunlight than any other country in the G20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer matters: at the heart of tackling climate&nbsp;change is bringing power to the world's poorest people without choking the planet with rising carbon emissions. The UN negotiations, which must deliver a deal to beat global warming by the end of 2015, began their final stage last week in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boosting clean energy is high on the agenda and solar is booming, with new installations around the world doubling every two years. China is also aggressively pursuing the green technology, installing 12,000MW in 2013 - a record for any country in a single year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As production goes up, panel costs are plummeting -down 80% since 2008, according to the New Climate Economy report. This puts solar on the edge of beating coal and gas on price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such energy choices are on Modi's desk: he has pledged to give electricity to the 300 million Indians living in the dark and energy experts are impressed with the impetus given in his first 100 days to renewable energy. Three more ultra-mega solar parks were backed with cash in July, as were solar-powered irrigation pumps and canal-top solar plants. The electric fences on India's sensitive northern borders will be solar-powered as the military installs 1,000MW of panels to replace expensive diesel generators across its posts. A further 7,000MW of solar is out for tender and the rooftops of Delhi are to be bedecked with panels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, glitzy shopping malls in blackout-prone cities are turning to solar for cheaper and more reliable energy, while Chennai is experimenting with solar-powered desalination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modi's power minister, Piyush Goyal, says solar has a glittering future. The previous government's target of 20,000MW of solar by 2022 will be smashed, he says. &quot;It will be much larger. I think for India to add 10,000MW a year (of solar) and six, or seven or eight of wind every year is not very difficult to envisage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But coal has not gone away. Electricity produced by coal burning between June and August jumped 21% on 2013 and coal mining is increasing. The state coal company aims to double production to 1bn tonnes a year by 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All acknowledge that coal must provide the steady power needed to underpin India's rapid economic development. But the extent to which solar eats into coal's share of the energy mix is crucial to keeping emissions down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a 16-metre-wide (50ft) irrigation canal that cuts through the green cotton and barley fields of Gujarat, another Modi project illustrates solar's fringe benefits. Here, 3,600 solar panels stretch half a mile along the waterway, but do not just produce power. With water the critical resource for the farmers, the shading of the canal by the solar array saves an estimated 9m litres of water from evaporating each year while the cooling effect of the water under the panels edges up the electricity output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the part of the canal in the sun is clogged with reeds but in the shade of the panels the water flows freely. Spanning the canal, while adding cost, also avoids covering valuable farmland with panels. &quot;The canal is the property of the government, so the cost of the land goes away too,&quot; says Ghodadra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modi is known to enjoy talking about the world-first canal project to other leaders and has backed a national expansion. Even using just 10% of the canals in Gujarat would give 2,200MW of solar power. Along with millions of solar water pumps, Goyal says this pushing of power into the countryside will lift the income of poor farmers and extend growing seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar power can also reach remote villages faster and cheaper than pylons, says Pranav Mehta, chair of the National Solar Energy Federation of India. &quot;The country needs more decentralised power, like rooftop solar, to reach the parts the grid has not reached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India's cities are another huge challenge, with many struggling with blackouts, particularly when temperatures soar and air conditioning is ramped up. Again, Modi's 13-year tenure in Gujarat is providing the solar template. This month it was announced that rooftop solar power projects in the state capital, Gandhinagar, will be replicated in Punjab and Delhi, where a storm in May plunged the grid into rolling blackouts for a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delhi is ever more power-hungry, but with little open land and 300-plus days of sunshine a year, rooftop solar is an attractive solution. Since businessman SN Dwivedi put solar panels on his home, the back-up system has been silent. &quot;I haven't used the diesel generator in my house for a year,&quot; he says. Goyal says rural and urban off-grid solar are being looked at &quot;very actively&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Modi factor is very real with solar. He recognises that not only is solar very clean, it is also very fast to build,&quot; says Pashupathy Gopalan, SunEdison's managing director in south Asia and Africa. He says the cost of solar versus coal is near a tipping point. &quot;Grid parity&quot;, ie equal cost, has been achieved for commercial and industrial customers putting panels on their roofs, Gopalan says, and is coming soon for other users. Bloomberg predicts parity for solar in India by 2020, while solar consultancy Bridge to India suggests 2018. &quot;I think the grid parity debate is history now,&quot; says Gopalan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grid parity would mean solar subsidies could be phased out, but Mehta notes that fossil fuels still get more than $40bn (&pound;24bn) in subsidy every year in India: &quot;You give me (a fraction) of that and I will make solar affordable and available everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajendra Pachauri, head of the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute and chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, thinks coal power expansion in India is likely to choke on supply problems. &quot;It is a myth that India can continue to produce more coal,&quot; he says. &quot;We have set up power stations in this country and there is no coal to run them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pachauri is optimistic India under Modi can follow the cleaner energy path. &quot;We have a prime minister who first, believes in climate&nbsp;change and, secondly, is a doer. It is a unique opportunity,&quot; he says. &quot;I believe you will see a snowballing of renewable energy developments in India in the next few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while a step-change in clean energy generation is a must if global warming is to be tamed, climate&nbsp;change does not have to be the principle reason for change, according to Pachauri. &quot;I don't think India is really (expanding renewable energy) to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Here it is happening largely because renewables will turn out to be the most feasible and attractive form of energy supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The savage heat waves that struck Australia last year were almost certainly a direct consequence of greenhouse gases released by human activity, researchers said Monday. It is perhaps the most definitive statement climate scientists have made tying a specific weather event to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five groups of researchers, using distinct methods, analyzed the heat that baked Australia for much of 2013 and continued into 2014, briefly shutting down the Australian Open tennis tournament in January when the temperature climbed to 111 degrees Fahrenheit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All five research groups came to the conclusion that last year's heat waves could not have been as severe without the long-term climatic warming caused by human emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When we look at the heat across the whole of Australia and the whole 12 months of 2013, we can say that this was virtually impossible without climate&nbsp;change,'' said David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne who led some of the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings relied on computer analyses of what the climate would have been like in the absence of human-caused greenhouse emissions, a type of research widely acknowledged to be imperfect, and which often produces conflicting findings from different groups. But scientists said the results in this case were strengthened by the unanimity of the papers, written by veteran research teams scattered around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The evidence in those papers is very strong,'' said Martin P. Hoerling, an American scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has often been skeptical of claimed links between weather events and global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other results published Monday, three research groups analyzed the drought afflicting California but could not come to a unanimous conclusion about whether the odds had been increased by human activity. One paper found that they had been; the two others found no clear evidence of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers generally agreed, however, that regardless of the causes, the effects of the California drought had been worsened by global warming. That is because whatever rain does fall in California tends to evaporate faster in the hotter climate, leading to drier conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two dozen papers analyzing weather extremes from 2013 were published on Monday in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. This look back at the prior year has become an annual event, as scientists increasingly try to answer the question many people ask after every extreme weather event: Did climate&nbsp;change have anything to do with it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several events in 2013, they were able to rule out such a link. Even though the overall global warming trend has been definitively linked to human emissions in scores of papers, the new reports show that the frequent impulse to attribute specific weather events to human activity is not always well grounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, one research group found that the type of extreme rainfall that struck parts of Colorado last September had become less likely, not more likely, in the warming climate. Another group, analyzing the heavy rains and floods that struck parts of Central Europe in June 2013, found no evidence that these could be attributed to global warming, even though such claims were made at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myles R. Allen, a researcher at Oxford whose group conducted the study on the European rains, noted in an interview that the science of attributing specific events to human emissions was still contentious and difficult, so any answers given today must be regarded as provisional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His group has found a measure of human influence on several weather events over the years. But with the science still emerging, he cautioned against the tendency to cite global warming as a cause of almost any kind of severe weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we don't have evidence, I don't think we should hint darkly all the time that human influence must be to blame somehow,'' Dr. Allen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new batch of reports analyzed extreme heat in 2013 not only in Australia, but also in Europe, China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula, with the researchers concluding in every case that global warming had made the occurrence of the heat extremes more likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Australian case, computer analyses of a hypothetical climate without human-caused emissions were simply unable to produce a year as extreme as 2013, and other analytical methods yielded similar answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But computer simulations that factored in those emissions and the warming they are causing showed an increasing likelihood of extraordinary heat waves in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australia finding is likely to add to an intense political debate in that country. The newly elected prime minister, Tony Abbott, has repealed a law intended to reduce emissions, and his government appointed a climate skeptic to lead a separate review of the country's renewable energy targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet scientists say that Australia, an arid land to begin with, may be among the primary victims if global warming is allowed to continue unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Colorado and Central European rains, the 2013 events for which scientists were able to rule out a human contribution included a blizzard in South Dakota, heavy snowfall in the Pyrenees in Europe and a cyclone that swept across northwestern Europe in late October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new reports come as scientists, responding to popular demand, are trying to speed up their analysis of extreme weather events and the role of greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It used to take them years to come to a clear view of any particular event; now, papers are being published within several months. By sometime next year, researchers hope to reduce that to a matter of days, with three groups of researchers around the world training their sights on extreme events as soon as they occur, then putting out reports while the public is still discussing the aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want to get to this place where we can answer the question when the media are asking it,'' said Heidi Cullen, a scientist with Climate Central, a news and research organization in Princeton, N.J., who is helping to lead the effort. ''We want to give the first, best answer we can possibly give.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUOGUE, N.Y. -- As the president of the Fire Island Association, Suzy Goldhirsch has a message she says she often offers property owners. ''We are living on a sandbar in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,'' she tells them. ''We are in a high-risk environment. We on barrier islands are on the front lines of climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same could be said of many coastal areas around the world, which are threatened by rising sea levels as the planet warms. But the barrier islands that line the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, from Cape Cod to the Mexican border, are a special case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report from the National Research Council finds that the effect of climate&nbsp;change is especially harsh on these islands. Population growth in much of this long coast ''is nearly twice the national average,'' the report said. Meanwhile, ''these same coasts are subject to impact by some of the most powerful storms on earth and the destruction potential of these events is increasing due to climate&nbsp;change and relative sea-level rise.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so far, the report added, ''as a compassionate nation, we rally each time a disaster strikes and provide resources for postdisaster recovery that far exceed those we are willing to provide to manage risk.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel calls for a regional or even national approach to managing coastal hazards -- a ''proactive'' effort to protect life, landscape and property, rather than the ''disjointed and largely reactive approach'' that has marked coastal protection efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until relatively recently, barrier islands defended themselves against rising seas by, in a sense, moving to higher ground: Storms washed beach sand to the islands' inland side; inlets formed and healed, usually leaving sand deposits behind the islands. This process worked well, as geologists noticed after the Ash Wednesday storm in 1962, a nor'easter that battered much of the East Coast through five high tides. Afterward, they reported that beach recovery was fastest and most robust in areas with the least development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today, Ms. Goldhirsch said, nature can no longer be left to take its course even as sea level rises. On many barrier islands, even federally designated national seashores like Fire Island, inlets are stabilized by rock jetties, beaches are routinely renourished with sand pumped from offshore, and miles of sea walls and other armor protect buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Let nature take its course -- I don't think that's good planning,'' she said. ''That's not public policy. Public policy is you have to figure out what to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the rapid development of the past few decades, the economic stakes have escalated drastically. The research council's report, ''Reducing Coastal Risk on the East and Gulf Coasts,'' says that from 1980 to 2013, the United States had 33 coastal storms that each caused more than $1 billion in damage, sometimes far more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While those storms represented about 22 percent of all the nation's billion-dollar-plus disasters over that period, they caused about 49 percent of the economic losses. Adjusted for inflation, losses from coastal storms have tripled since 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many losses result from storm surge, the bulge of water that storms push onshore. Even if storms do not increase in frequency or intensity, the sea level's rising will worsen damage from storm surge, which the report calls ''the most destructive aspect of a hurricane.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsidies, emergency relief and ad hoc projects on the East and Gulf Coasts have encouraged development in the face of such danger, the report said. These can be ''inappropriate incentives'' according to the panel's head, Richard A. Luettich Jr., a professor of marine sciences at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was commissioned by the Army Corps of Engineers, which, acting on the instructions of Congress, has had a large hand in this work. Among its other projects in response to Hurricane Sandy, the corps plans a Fire Island project that would pump seven million cubic yards of sand from offshore and construct new dunes and beaches along almost 20 miles of beachfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters argue that the project will strengthen the island and that, in turn, will protect low-lying shore communities across Great South Bay. But opponents disagree, citing assessments from the United States Geological Survey; Fire Island's relative stability over time; and other factors. Left alone, they argue, it will eventually recover from the storm. And drawing sand from offshore deposits to build new dunes could actually harm the island, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, the National Audubon Society won a temporary restraining order halting the project, saying that pumping sand onto the island would harm nesting sites for endangered shorebirds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private and publicly financed shoreline engineering projects are provoking similar arguments in places like Nantucket Island, Mass.; Harvey Cedars, on Long Beach Island, N.J.; and the Outer Banks of North Carolina. On many barrier islands, daily life becomes more complicated as sea level rises. Here in Quogue, east of Fire Island, people use caution when driving on the main beach road when the moon is full (when tides are unusually high) because that's when salt water from Quantuck Bay can flood across the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Outer Banks, the main road washes out routinely now, whenever ''the tide is high and the wind is blowing,'' as some residents put it. And everywhere, people are raising their houses on pilings, sometimes 20 feet or more in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the expert panel said, it is hard to win support for safety measures that would require communities to ''forgo revenue-generating potential by limiting development.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert S. Young, the director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University, said he was glad to see the expert panel emphasize the need for a long-term, large-scale, proactive approach because ''managing the coast parcel by parcel is a bad idea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every single problem we have today is only going to get worse in the future,'' he said. ''The only uncertainty is how fast they are going to get worse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But getting such a message across will be difficult, the panel said, adding that ''assessing, communicating and managing risk in coastal areas are very challenging concepts even for a committee of experts in coastal science and engineering.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Goldhirsch said Fire Island could be a model for intelligent planning, in part because even though people would bring different interests and goals to the process, ''we all love the place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family has summered on Fire Island for more than 100 years, she said, and she understands its dangers. Hers is a modest house, where she keeps no valuables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I tell people, 'If you don't have the nervous system to live in a risky situation, it's O.K. to sell or stormproof your house, or live modestly,' '' she said. ''Don't try to get the federal government to pay for everything. They don't have enough money.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE are barreling into the Anthropocene, the sixth mass extinction in the history of the planet. A recent study published in the journal Science concluded that the world's species are disappearing as much as 1,000 times faster than the rate at which species naturally go extinct. It's a one-two punch -- on top of the ecosystems we've broken, extreme weather from a changing climate causes even more damage. By 2100, researchers say, one-third to one-half of all Earth's species could be wiped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, efforts to protect species are ramping up as governments, scientists and nonprofit organizations try to build a modern version of Noah's Ark. The new ark certainly won't come in the form of a large boat, or even always a place set aside. Instead it is a patchwork quilt of approaches, including assisted migration, seed banks and new preserves and travel corridors based on where species are likely to migrate as seas rise or food sources die out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questions are complex. What species do you save? The ones most at risk? Charismatic animals, such as lions or bears or elephants? The ones most likely to survive? The species that hold the most value for us?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One initiative, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services formed in 2012 by the governments of 121 countries, aims to protect and restore species in wild areas and to protect species like bees that carry out valuable ecosystem service functions in the places people live. Some three-quarters of the world's food production depends primarily on bees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We still know very little about what could or should be included in the ark and where,'' said Walter Jetz, an ecologist at Yale involved with the project. Species are being wiped out even before we know what they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another project, the EDGE of Existence, run by the Zoological Society of London, seeks to protect the most unusual wildlife at highest risk. These are species that evolved on their own for so long that they are very different from other species. Among the species the project has helped to preserve are the tiny bumblebee bat and the golden-rumped elephant shrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the traditional approach to protecting species is to buy land, preservation of the right habitat can be a moving target, since it's not known how species will respond to a changing climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To complete the maps of where life lives, scientists have enlisted the crowd. A crowdsourcing effort called the Global Biodiversity Information Facility identifies and curates biodiversity data -- such as photos of species taken with a smartphone -- to show their distribution and then makes the information available online. That is especially helpful to researchers in developing countries with limited budgets. Another project, Lifemapper, at the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute, uses the data to understand where a species might move as its world changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We know that species don't persist long in fragmented areas and so we try and reconnect those fragments,'' said Stuart L. Pimm, a professor of conservation at Duke University, and head of a nonprofit organization called SavingSpecies. One of his group's projects in the Colombian Andes identified a forest that contains a carnivorous mammal that some have described as a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear, called an olinguito, new to science. Using crowd-sourced data, ''we worked with local conservation groups and helped them buy land, reforest the land and reconnect pieces,'' Dr. Pimm says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coastal areas, especially, are getting scrutiny. Biologists in Florida, which faces a daunting sea level rise, are working on a plan to set aside land farther inland as a reserve for everything from the MacGillivray's seaside sparrow to the tiny Key deer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To thwart something called ''coastal squeeze,'' a network of ''migratory greenways'' is envisioned so that species can move on their own away from rising seas to new habitat. ''But some are basically trapped,'' said Reed F. Noss, a professor of conservation biology at the University of Central Florida who is involved in the effort, and they will most likely need to be picked up and moved. The program has languished, but Amendment 1, on the ballot this November, would provide funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One species at risk is the Florida panther. Once highly endangered, with just 20 individuals left, this charismatic animal has come back -- some. But a quarter or more of its habitat is predicted to be under some three feet of water by 2100. Males will move on their own, but females will need help because they won't cross the Caloosahatchee River. Experts hope to create reserves north of the river, and think at some point they will have to move females to new quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting land between reserves is vital. The Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, known as Y2Y, would protect corridors between wild landscapes in the Rockies from Yellowstone National Park to northern Canada, which would allow species to migrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RESEARCHERS have also focused on ''refugia,'' regions around the world that have remained stable during previous swings of the Earth's climate -- and that might be the best bet for the survival of life this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A section of the Driftless Area encompassing northeastern Iowa and southern Minnesota, also known as Little Switzerland, has ice beneath some of its ridges. The underground refrigerator means the land never gets above 50 or so degrees and has kept the Pleistocene snail, long thought extinct, from disappearing there. Other species might find refuge there as things get hot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A roughly 250-acre refugia on the Little Cahaba River in Alabama has been called a botanical lost world, because of its wide range of unusual plants, including eight species found nowhere else. Dr. Noss said these kinds of places should be sought out and protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Janzen, a conservation ecologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is working to protect large tracts in Costa Rica, said that to truly protect biodiversity, a place-based approach must be tailored to the country. A reserve needs to be large, to be resilient against a changing climate, and so needs the support of the people who live with the wild place and will want to protect it. ''To survive climate&nbsp;change we need to minimize the other assaults, such as illegal logging and contaminating water,'' he said. ''Each time you add one of those you make it more sensitive to climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, beneath the permafrost on an island in the Arctic Ocean north of mainland Norway, preserves seeds from food crops. Frozen zoos keep the genetic material from extinct and endangered animals. The Archangel Ancient Tree Archive in Michigan, meanwhile, founded by a family of shade tree growers, has made exact genetic duplicates of some of the largest trees on the planet and planted them in ''living libraries'' elsewhere -- should something befall the original.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Connie Barlow, a biologist and conservationist, helped move an endangered conifer tree in Florida north by planting seedlings in cooler regions. Now she is working in the West. ''I just assisted in the migration of the alligator juniper in New Mexico by planting seeds in Colorado,'' she said. ''We have to. Climate&nbsp;change is happening so fast and trees are the least capable of moving.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama stood in the chamber of the United Nations General Assembly last week and urged the world to follow his example and fight global warming. But a major new declaration calling for a global price on carbon -- signed by 74 countries and more than 1,000 businesses and investors -- is missing a key signatory: the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration, released by the World Bank the day before Mr. Obama's speech at the United Nations Climate Summit, has been signed by China, Shell, Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola. It calls on all nations to enact laws forcing industries to pay for the carbon emissions that scientists say are the leading cause of global warming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, which is under growing international pressure to price carbon, is missing from the declaration for a key reason: conservative opposition to Mr. Obama's climate&nbsp;change proposals, specifically a carbon tax. The opposition will only intensify if Republicans win control of the Senate in November and the new majority leader is Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, where coal -- the world's largest source of carbon pollution -- is the lifeblood of the state's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's time for the global elites to face facts,'' Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ''President Obama's war on coal won't have any meaningful impact on global carbon emissions. What it will do is ship American jobs overseas, raise the cost of living substantially for middle and working-class families and throw thousands more Kentuckians out of work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the nonbinding World Bank declaration is meant largely as a show of resolve ahead of a 2015 climate summit in Paris, it signals the broadest, most explicit effort to date of world leaders and financial institutions to push all nations to enact new taxes on old forms of energy. The declaration notes that governments can either directly tax carbon pollution or create market-based cap-and-trade systems, which force companies to buy government-issued pollution permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The most powerful move that a government can make in the fight against climate&nbsp;change is to put a price on carbon,'' said Rachel Kyte, the World Bank's vice president of sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many Republicans on Capitol Hill, such statements are anathema. In 2010, after Mr. Obama tried but failed in the face of conservative opposition to push a national cap-and-trade bill through Congress, victorious Republicans galvanized against the idea and launched campaigns against politicians who support carbon pricing. Mr. Obama in turn circumvented Congress and in June released a new Environmental Protection Agency regulation under his executive authority that requires states to submit their own plans to cut emissions -- but does not tell them explicitly how to do so. Nonetheless, California and nine northwestern states have already enacted cap-and-trade programs, and seven states -- California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- signed on to the World Bank declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to avoid more opposition from conservatives, Mr. Obama and other top administration officials no longer call publicly for a national price on carbon. But they have nonetheless signaled their support for international and state efforts. In his speech at the United Nations, Mr. Obama quoted the Democratic governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, who is urging other states to pass carbon pricing laws: ''As one of America's governors has said, 'We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate&nbsp;change and the last generation that can do something about it.' '' The Obama administration has also enacted a policy signaling its readiness to price carbon should the politics of Congress ever shift: a metric it calls ''the social cost of carbon,'' designed to account for the cost of one ton of carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Obama's economists have determined the cost to be $37 a ton. Secretary of State John Kerry, a longtime advocate of government policy to fight climate&nbsp;change -- and the chief author of the failed 2010 cap-and-trade bill in the Senate -- last week told a meeting of the Major Economies Forum that ''when it comes to climate&nbsp;change, we know exactly what it takes to get the job done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Kerry did not specifically mention carbon pricing at the forum, a gathering of foreign ministers of the world's 20 largest economies, and said only, ''It takes energy policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40 countries have already implemented carbon pricing policy, while dozens of others are now exploring it. In 2005, the European Union enacted a cap-and-trade plan for carbon pollution, and at the United Nations last week, European leaders pushed hard for the rest of the world to sign on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We need to define a new economy of the world,'' President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande of France said in his remarks at the climate summit. ''There will have to be a new pricing system for carbon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekend before the summit, more than 300,000 people protested at a climate&nbsp;change demonstration in the streets of New York, where marchers waved signs reading ''Tax carbon!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new carbon pricing push comes as countries and institutions that once fought the idea are now embracing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''On carbon pricing, there's a perfect storm taking place,'' said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard. ''There is increasing recognition that approaches that have been taken in the past haven't worked, and that the only way one can affect the hundreds of millions of decisions is through price signals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last year China has enacted seven pilot cap-and-trade programs in its provinces, although outside experts remain skeptical of Beijing's plans as the nation's carbon emissions continue to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the political power of the coal industry to fight such laws remains potent. Australia, a major coal-producing nation, offers a case study in the political dangers of supporting a carbon tax in a coal-heavy democracy. A former Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, made tackling climate&nbsp;change a signature issue and enacted a carbon tax -- a move that was seen as political suicide. Last year Australians voted her out of office and this past summer, the new prime minister, Tony Abbott, pushed through a bill to repeal the carbon price.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India reminded the world on Saturday of his country's abiding battle against extremist groups, and took a swipe at countries that give them shelter before capping his speech with a call for an International Yoga Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Modi, without naming names, hinted at India's longstanding contention that its rival, Pakistan, backs groups that have carried out terrorist attacks on Indian soil. Twenty years ago, world leaders used to call it a ''law and order problem,'' he said, suggesting that only now had they had come around to understanding India's concerns. ''Some countries are giving refuge to international terrorists,'' he said. ''They consider terrorism to be a tool of their policy.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi signaled his support for the United States' renewed focus on fighting terrorism, and showed that he clearly understands the value of political symbolism. Even before he arrived at the United Nations, he paid a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in lower Manhattan. In his meetings at the White House scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, security and counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries is certain to be on the agenda, including a discussion of the American-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, administration officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi arrived early Saturday for his meeting with the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. He toured a section of the second floor corridor of the United Nations complex to see several works of art, including an 11th century stone sculpture that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India presented to the world body in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, he said not a word about a decade-long visa ban by the United States government that had prevented him from coming to the United States since the deadly religious violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, which he then led.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defying Expectations in India, Modi Begins Key Trip to U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On climate&nbsp;change, India is under scrutiny for how it will commit to cutting its future emissions. On this issue, Mr. Modi did not show his hand. He spoke about ''shouldering our responsibilities,'' and reminded rich countries that they have promised to help pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, his environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, flatly said India's emissions would necessarily grow through new coal-powered electricity and transportation in the coming years as the country seeks to alleviate poverty and create industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi offered yoga as one of India's contributions to global efforts. It is not just exercise, he said. ''By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate&nbsp;change,'' he said. ''Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Mr. Modi rebuked India's neighbor and rival Pakistan, a day after its prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, raised the issue of a referendum for disputed Kashmir province -- long a sore spot for India. Mr. Modi said talks with Pakistan were possible in a ''peaceful atmosphere without the shadow of terrorism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''However, Pakistan must also take its responsibility seriously to create an appropriate environment,'' he said. ''Raising issues in thisforum is not the way to make progress towards resolving issues between our two countries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawaz Sharif on Stability in Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began his remarks in an unusually understated way, speaking from prepared notes, which is rare for him, before picking up rhetorical steam and force. He repeatedly invoked India's Vedic traditions. Mr. Modi spoke in Hindi, as expected, with a generous sprinkling of English words like ''prosperity,'' ''cyber,'' and ''blue helmets.'' India is among the largest contributors of soldiers to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and Mr. Modi sharply nudged the Security Council to include nations like his when making decisions about what peacekeepers are expected to do. His comments hinted at the tensions that arise between countries that contribute troops and the world powers on the Security Council that fund them, and set their mandates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi renewed India's call for a permanent seat on the Security Council, pointedly reminding the audience that the Council's permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States -- represent a bygone era. ''Institutions that reflect the imperatives of 20th century won't be effective in the 21st,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before his arrival in New York, a federal court issued a summons for Mr. Modi to respond to a lawsuit that accuses him of human rights abuses in connection with religious riots in 2002 that tore through Gujarat. Mr. Modi, who was the chief minister of the state at the time of the riots, has been accused of acting too slowly to stop the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi did not refer to the summons, and it is likely to have no effect. As an administration official pointed out Friday, ''as a general legal principle, sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from suits in American courts.'' The protection applies to sitting heads of national delegations to the General Assembly, the official added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers and mayors, the ministers and presidents, have come and gone. So what is the verdict on Climate Week, the summit meeting on global warming convened by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in New York?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was not intended to reach a global agreement or to extract tangible commitments from individual nations to reduce the greenhouse gases that are changing the world's ecosystems and could well spin out of control. Its purpose was to build momentum for a new global deal to be completed in December 2015, in Paris.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that respect, it clearly moved the ball forward, not so much in the official speeches but on the streets and in the meeting rooms where corporate leaders, investors, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and state and local officials pressed the case for stronger action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was important to put climate&nbsp;change back on the radar screen of world leaders, whose last effort to strike a deal, in Copenhagen five years ago, ended in acrimonious disaster. President Obama, for one, was as eloquent as he has ever been on the subject: ''For all the immediate challenges that we gather to address this week -- terrorism, instability, inequality, disease -- there's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the positive energy at this gathering came from people closer to the ground, like the 300,000 activists who marched last Sunday. They included mayors like New York's Michael Bloomberg and his successor, Bill de Blasio, who both spoke of the critical role that cities can play in reducing emissions. They included governors like California's Jerry Brown, who is justly proud of his state's pathbreaking efforts to control automobile and power plant pollution. And they included institutions like Bank of America, which said it would invest in renewable energy, and companies like Kellogg and Nestle, which pledged to help stem the destruction of tropical forests by changing the way they buy commodities like soybeans and palm oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying all these declarations was a palpable conviction that tackling climate&nbsp;change could be an opportunity and not a burden, that the way to approach the task of harnessing greenhouse gas emissions was not to ask how much it would cost but how much nations stood to gain by investing in new technologies and energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This burst of activity comes at a crucial time. A tracking initiative called the Global Carbon Project recently reported that greenhouse gas emissions jumped 2.3 percent in 2013, mainly because of big increases in China and India. This means it is becoming increasingly difficult to limit global warming to an upper boundary of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, a world already suffering from disappearing glaciers, rising seas and persistent droughts could face even more alarming consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avoiding such a fate is going to require a revolution in the way the world produces and consumes energy, which clearly has to involve national governments, no matter how much commitment there is on the streets and in the boardrooms. The odds are long that a legally binding treaty will emerge from Paris. Congress is unlikely to ratify one anyway. The smart money now is on a softer agreement that brings all the big polluters on board with national emissions caps, and there are reasons for hope that this can be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is in a much stronger leadership position than he was at Copenhagen, having engineered a huge increase in automobile fuel efficiency and proposed rules that will greatly reduce the United States' reliance on dirty coal. The Chinese, in part because their own air is so dirty, have been investing heavily in alternative energy sources like wind and solar, and they are giving serious consideration to a national cap on coal consumption. The cooperation of these two countries could by itself create the conditions for a breakthrough agreement. But what might really do the trick -- if Climate Week is any guide -- is the emergence of a growing bottom-up movement for change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Indian&amp;#8217;s prime minister made his first speech at the United Nations General Assembly. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India reminded the world on Saturday of his country's abiding battle against extremist groups, and took a swipe at countries that give them shelter before capping his speech with a call for an International Yoga Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Modi, without naming names, hinted at India's longstanding contention that its rival, Pakistan, backs groups that have carried out terrorist attacks on Indian soil. Twenty years ago, world leaders used to call it a &quot;law and order problem,&quot; he said, suggesting that only now had they had come around to understanding India's concerns. &quot;Some countries are giving refuge to international terrorists,&quot; he said. &quot;They consider terrorism to be a tool of their policy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi signaled his support for the United States' renewed focus on fighting terrorism, and showed that he clearly understands the value of political symbolism. Even before he arrived at the United Nations, he paid a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in lower Manhattan. In his meetings at the White House scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, security and counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries is certain to be on the agenda, including a discussion of the American-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, administration officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi arrived early Saturday for his meeting with the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. He toured a section of the second floor corridor of the United Nations complex to see several works of art, including an 11th century stone sculpture that  former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India presented to the world body in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, he said not a word about a decade-long visa ban by the United States government that had prevented him from coming to the United States since the deadly religious violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, which he then led.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defying Expectations in India, Modi Begins Key Trip to U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On climate&nbsp;change, India is under scrutiny for how it will commit to cutting its future emissions. On this issue, Mr. Modi did not show his hand. He spoke about &quot;shouldering our responsibilities,&quot; and reminded rich countries that they have promised to help pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, his environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, flatly saidIndia's emissions would necessarily grow through new coal-powered electricity and transportation in the coming years as the country seeks to alleviate poverty and create industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi offered yoga as one of India's contributions to global efforts. It is not just exercise, he said.  &quot;By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate&nbsp;change,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Mr. Modi rebuked India's neighbor and rival Pakistan, a day after its prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, raised the issue of a referendum for disputed Kashmir province - long a sore spot for India. Mr. Modi said talks with Pakistan were possible in a &quot;peaceful atmosphere without the shadow of terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, Pakistan must also take its responsibility seriously to create an appropriate environment,&quot; he said. &quot;Raising issues in thisforum is not the way to make progress towards resolving issues between our two countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawaz Sharif on Stability in Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began his remarks in an unusually understated way, speaking from prepared notes, which is rare for him, before picking up rhetorical steam and force. He repeatedly invoked India's Vedic traditions. Mr. Modi spoke in Hindi, as expected, with a generous sprinkling of English words like &quot;prosperity,&quot; &quot;cyber,&quot; and &quot;blue helmets.&quot; India is among the largest contributors of soldiers to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and Mr. Modi sharply nudged the Security Council to include nations like his when making decisions about what peacekeepers are expected to do.  His comments hinted at the tensions that arise between countries that contribute troops and the world powers on the Security Council that fund them, and set their mandates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi renewed India's call for a permanent seat on the Security Council, pointedly reminding the audience that the Council's permanent members - Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States - represent a bygone era. &quot;Institutions that reflect the imperatives of 20th century won't be effective in the 21st,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before his arrival in New York, a federal court issued a summons for Mr. Modito respond to a lawsuit that accuses him of human rights abuses in connection with religious riots in 2002 that tore through Gujarat. Mr. Modi, who was the chief minister of the state at the time of the riots, has been accused of acting too slowly to stop the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Modi did not refer to the summons, and it is likely to have no effect. As an administration official pointed out Friday, &quot;as a general legal principle, sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from suits in American courts.&quot; The protection applies to sitting heads of national delegations to the General Assembly, the official added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a modern-day Noah, looking to ride out the next great flood in an ark made of rotting plastic. Small balloons tethered to his jacket float jauntily above his head as he applies for a loan to build the boat. Turned down, he vows to go straight to the people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Crowdfunding,'' Noah (Luigi Cerri) says, and with that single word of English, he gets a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such a vital connection with the audience is mostly missing from ''Ga&iuml;a Global Circus,'' a thoughtful climate-change play by Pierre Daubigny, performed almost entirely in French with English supertitles at the Kitchen, where it is presented with the Brown Institute of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced by Compagnie AccenT and Soif Compagnie, the play was conceived by the French philosopher Bruno Latour, who has long engaged with environmental dilemmas. Billed as the centerpiece of four days of Latour events at Columbia this week, the play takes aim at a problem he has described as the ''abysmal distance between our little selfish human worries and the great questions of ecology'': our failure to feel much of anything in the face of the climate crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of vignettes performed beneath a billowing, floating canopy (by Olivier Vallet), ''Ga&iuml;a Global Circus'' wants to rouse us from our collective shrug. It attempts this in part by invoking figures from mythology, like the Greek goddess Ga&iuml;a, who personifies the Earth, and Cassandra, the prophet whose curse was that she would not be believed. Climate scientists, the play suggests, are similarly spurned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the dialogue-heavy production, directed by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique A&iuml;t-Touati and the philosopher's daughter, Chlo&eacute; Latour, is stymied by a design problem. Instead of watching the play, non-Francophone spectators must direct their attention to one of two small monitors off to either side of the stage to read supertitles that often translate only a bit of what's being said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, the disconnect was palpable. The fine, hardworking cast of four and its attentive audience were caught, most of the time, on opposite sides of a language barrier, which was in turn an impediment to emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most successful moments tend to be wordless, or nearly so: When people begin to riot in a scene of apocalyptic chaos that evokes Anne Washburn's ''Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play''; when a storm from what seems like the end of the world rumbles through and makes our bodies vibrate; when, at last, the floating canopy envelops us and we feel strangely safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another scene, too, in which a girl (Jade Collinet) speaks with adolescent passion about the Beatles song ''She's Leaving Home.'' As it plays, she addresses us in English, and the moment is completely alive, a tender reminder of what is sweet about each new generation. It does what the play intends: calls to mind in a visceral way why we need to keep this home of ours healthy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;We can be certain about climate change uncertainty but still address the risk. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven E. Koonin, once the Obama administration's undersecretary of energy for science and chief scientist at BP, stirred up a swirl of turbulence in global warming discourse this week after The Wall Street Journal published &quot;Climate Science is Not Settled,&quot; his essay calling for more frankness about areas of deep uncertainty in climate science, more research to narrow error ranges and more acknowledgement that society's decisions on energy and climate policy are based on values as much as data. (The Journal seems to keep this headline on file; here's a 2009 essay, &quot;Climate Science Isn't Settled,&quot; by the M.I.T. climatologist Richard Lindzen.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, the piece by Koonin, who became the founding director of New York University's important Center for Urban Science and Progress in 2012, was quickly hailed by fossil fuel defenders. At the same time, some of Koonin's central points about the state of climate science were sharply challenged by climate scientists and climate campaigners. I was on the run at the time but sent Koonin a couple of questions, which I also posted on Tumblr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here they are with his answers (with some email shorthand cleaned up), along with a fresh critique of Koonin's argument by a group of climate science and policy researchers associated with Carnegie Mellon University&nbsp;and a final thought from me: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your piece makes the important point that, on vital questions, there's enduring deep uncertainty behind the &quot;97 Percent of Climate Scientists Agree&quot; headlines and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change report summary language. That was the point of my pieces on the many &quot;shapes&quot; of climate knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think your piece implies too much that further scientific inquiry can improve the picture. On regional forecasting, extremes (hurricanes), sensitivity to doubled CO2, and other key questions, further science - if anything - has clarified that some of these uncertainties aren't going anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree that regional and extremes are probably hopeless. But I would suppose that equilibrium climate sensitivity [ background ] and even global mean surface temperature on a decadal scale could be better nailed down by model pruning and better ocean data. An interesting way to test that (which I don't think has ever been done, but don't know for sure) is to assume one of the models is the truth, downscale the sampling of the data to what we might reasonably observe in the real world, and see to what extent that can be used to recover the truth. The results would give some indication of the extent to which more observations would help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You also imply that you can't have &quot;good&quot; climate policy in the face of deep persistent uncertainty. In other endeavors, society has figured this out and some sustained inquiry is going into how to take a least-regrets policy on the greenhouse buildup. See the World Bank paper on &quot;Investment Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty - Application to Climate&nbsp;Change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is indeed implied by the tagline [&quot;We are very far from the knowledge needed to make good climate policy&quot;], which I didn't write or even see until publication. As I hoped to imply in the last few paragraphs of the article, we can get to good climate policies, but they will depend as much (or even more) upon &quot;values&quot; than upon science, given the latter's uncertainties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the open letter written by nine scientists affiliated with the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon (their :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uncertainty in Climate Science: Not an Excuse for Inaction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, more than three hundred thousand people marched in New York City and around the world to urge governments to support an agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate&nbsp;change. Then, on September 23, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted the 2014 UN Climate Summit. There is hope that this meeting will catalyze leadership support for an agreement that enables a pathway to avoid large impacts from climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the world waited for these events to unfold, on September 20 the Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled &quot;Climate Science is Not Settled.&quot; In this editorial, Steve E. Koonin, Undersecretary for Science in the Department of Energy during President Barack Obama's first term and current director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress at New York University, argued that while there is agreement that the climate is changing, there is no scientific agreement about the implications of climate&nbsp;change. Further, he suggests that existing climate models are unable to provide accurate predictions of future climate. Reading the editorial leaves the impression that we don't have enough information to make decisions about climate&nbsp;change and that we should focus our efforts &quot;to make climate projections more useful over time.&quot; As scientists and decision-makers working on many fronts of the climate&nbsp;change problem, we believe this is a dangerous message. We are writing this response in order to highlight our concerns and lend our voices to support the 2014 U.N. Climate Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his editorial Dr. Koonin states in categorical terms that climate is changing, and that burning fossil fuels is the cause. We highlight that when climate scientists say the science is &quot;settled,&quot; that is precisely what we mean - no more and no less. When a sitting senator calls climate&nbsp;change science a &quot;hoax,&quot; it is no wonder that climate scientists need to stress that the fundamentals are settled. Indeed, the fundamentals of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect were well understood in the 19th century. Dr. Koonin also acknowledges that the IPCC reports describe the limitations associated with climate models. However, he fails to discuss how, even though the detailed results may vary, all of these climate models indicate our emissions of greenhouse gases will have a substantial effect on the climate system in the coming decades. We do not argue that we have complete certainty about the implications of such warming. We argue we have enough information to warrant action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate skeptics often argue that, during the last fifteen years, global temperatures have been nearly flat and that climate models are unable to predict or explain this pattern. This so-called &quot;climate hiatus&quot; rears its head again in Dr. Koonin's editorial. In fact, these last fifteen years are in no way surprising: 1998 was an extremely hot El Ni&ntilde;o year and the early 2000s were at the peak of a strong solar cycle. The remarkable thing is that global temperatures have remained close to the peak values of the late 1990s despite the fact that natural sources of variability would indicate that they should have cooled. A statistical model (based on the work of Judith Lean at the Naval Research Laboratory) that accounts for solar variability, El Ni&ntilde;o, volcanic activity, and greenhouse warming indicates that the underlying trend of global warming has accelerated over the past 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are further baffled by Dr. Koonin's implication that climate feedbacks are so complicated that there might be some negative feedback that makes the whole thing go away. Yes, the detailed physics of feedbacks are uncertain, but understanding isn't just based on theory or recent history. The geological record is filled with evidence that feedbacks (mostly water vapor, some others) will amplify the intrinsic greenhouse signal, and we are not aware of any evidence to support the notion that a &quot;white knight&quot; negative feedback will make this all go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Koonin is correct that there is still uncertainty about the magnitude of the impacts of climate&nbsp;change and society will have to make decisions under such uncertainty. He seems to suggest, however, that there is enough scientific uncertainty that we can't even claim that the impacts of climate&nbsp;change will cause harm. Further, he seems to imply that we should limit our efforts to &quot;no regrets&quot; alternatives such as &quot;accelerating the development of low-emissions technologies and in cost-effective energy-efficiency measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detailed impacts of climate&nbsp;change remain uncertain. However, every comprehensive assessment of climate&nbsp;change impacts points to serious disruptions ahead. Given that ecosystems and human society have evolved to adapt to the current climate, it can hardly be otherwise. Even the &quot;lower bound&quot; on climate&nbsp;change impacts will cause harm. Moreover, the costs of climate&nbsp;change mitigation are controllable and can be phased in gradually with intelligent policy instruments. Dr. Koonin suggests that &quot;the crucial, unsettled scientific question for policy is, how will the climate&nbsp;change over the next century under both natural and human influences?&quot; We propose that the crucial question for climate policy is what are policy actions we should undertake now in the face of these uncertainties. This will not be the first time we, as a society, have to make difficult decisions under uncertain conditions. And, as the Charney report to the National Academy of Sciences stated 35 years ago, &quot;a wait and see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heartily concur with their closing thought, but also with some of Koonin's central points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressing the frontiers of climate science and related research is vital, but it's wishful thinking to expect further science to substantially narrow uncertainties on time scales that matter when it comes to regional or short-term climate forecasting, the range of possible warming from a big buildup of carbon dioxide, the impact of greenhouse forcing on rare extremes and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's plenty that can be done right now to advance policies attuned to today's understanding of the building human influence on climate - along with climate's big influence on humans - and much of that is work that everyone can agree on.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Miami Beach, rising sea levels have interesting consequences. The ocean periodically starts bubbling up through local drainpipes. By the time it's over, the concept of ''going down to the water'' has extended to stepping off the front porch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's becoming a seasonal event, like swallows at Capistrano or the return of the buzzards to Hinckley, Ohio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At the spring and fall high tides, we get flooding of coastal areas,'' said Leonard Berry, the director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies. ''You've got saltwater coming up through the drains, into the garages and sidewalks and so on, damaging the Ferraris and the Lexuses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, climate&nbsp;change. A vast majority of scientific studies that take a stand on global warming have concluded that it's caused by human behavior. The results are awful. The penguins are dwindling. The polar bears are running out of ice floes. The cornfields are drying. The southwest is frying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is very little on the plus side. Except maybe for Detroit. As Jennifer Kingson reported in The Times this week, one scientific school of thought holds that while temperatures rise and weather becomes extreme in other parts of the country, Detroit's location will turn it into a veritable garden spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami is probably not used to being compared unfavorably to Detroit. But there you are. ''We're going to wander around shin-deep in the ocean -- on the streets of Miami,'' said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who is planning to go on a climate-change tour this month with Florida's senior senator, Bill Nelson. (The junior senator, Marco Rubio, who's no fan of ''these scientists,'' will presumably not be joining the party.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a week, when the Senate is in session, Whitehouse gets up and makes a speech about rising sea levels or disappearing lakes or dwindling glaciers. He's kind of the congressional climate-change guy. He's also looking for bipartisan love and feeling lonely. ''I've got exactly no Republican colleagues helping me out with this,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time, children, when the parties worked together on climate-change issues. No more. Only 3 percent of current Republican members of Congress have been willing to go on record as accepting the fact that people are causing global warming. That, at least, was the calculation by PolitiFact, which found a grand total of eight Republican nondeniers in the House and Senate. That includes Representative Michael Grimm of New York, who while laudably open-minded on this subject, is also under indictment for perjury and tax fraud. So we may be pushing 2 percent in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is sort of stunning. We're only looking for a simple acknowledgment of basic facts. We'll give a pass to folks who accept the connection between human behavior and climate&nbsp;change, but say they don't want to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that China should do something first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or: ''Who cares? I'm from Detroit!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Congress, Republican environmentalists appear to be terrified of what should be the most basic environmental issue possible. Whitehouse blames the Supreme Court's decisions on campaign finance, which gave the energy barons carte blanche when it comes to spending on election campaigns. It's certainly true that there's no way to tick off megadonors like the fabled Koch brothers faster than to suggest the globe is warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At the moment, there's a dogma in the Republican Party about what you can say,'' Tom Steyer told me. He's the billionaire who formed a ''super PAC'' to support candidates who acknowledge that climate&nbsp;change exists, that it's caused by human behavior, and that we need to do something major about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyer has committed to spending about $100 million this year on ads and organizing in seven states. Many in the campaign-finance-reform community think this is a terrible idea, and that you do not combat the power of right-wing oligarchs to influence American elections by doing the same thing on the left. They have a point. But think of the penguins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, who's running for re-election, has been asked many times whether he believes in man-made climate&nbsp;change. Lately, he responds: ''I'm not a scientist.'' Scott is also not a doctor, engineer, computer programmer, personal trainer or a bus driver. Really, it's amazing he even has the confidence to walk into the office in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor did visit last month with some climate scientists. He began the meeting by making it clear that he did not intend to go anywhere near the word causes. After the group had pulled out their maps and projections -- including the one that shows much of Miami-Dade County underwater by 2048 -- Scott asked them questions. Which were, according to The Miami Herald, ''to explain their backgrounds, describe the courses they taught, and where students in their academic fields get jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they're lucky, the students will wind up someplace where there's no seawater in the garage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blow to American hopes of reaching an international deal to fight global warming, India's new environment minister said Wednesday that his country would not offer a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions ahead of a climate summit next year in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister, Prakash Javadekar, said in an interview that his government's first priority was to alleviate poverty and improve the nation's economy, which he said would necessarily involve an increase in emissions through new coal-powered electricity and transportation. He placed responsibility for what scientists call a coming climate crisis on the United States, the world's largest historic greenhouse gas polluter, and dismissed the idea that India would make cuts to carbon emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What cuts?'' Mr. Javadekar said. ''That's for more developed countries. The moral principle of historic responsibility cannot be washed away.'' Mr. Javadekar was referring to an argument frequently made by developing economies -- that developed economies, chiefly the United States, which spent the last century building their economies while pumping warming emissions into the atmosphere -- bear the greatest responsibility for cutting pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Javadekar said that government agencies in New Delhi were preparing plans for India's domestic actions on climate&nbsp;change, but he said they would lead only to a lower rate of increase in carbon emissions. It would be at least 30 years, he said, before India would likely see a downturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''India's first task is eradication of poverty,'' Mr. Javadekar said, speaking in a New York hotel suite a day after a United Nations climate summit. ''Twenty percent of our population doesn't have access to electricity, and that's our top priority. We will grow faster, and our emissions will rise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India is the world's third-largest carbon polluter, behind China and the United States, and Mr. Javadekar's comments are a first indication of the direction of the environmental policies of the new prime minister, Narendra Modi, the author of a 2011 e-book, ''A Convenient Action.'' Although the book, a response to the movie ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' presents the moral case for action on climate&nbsp;change, Mr. Javadekar said that coal, the world's top source of carbon pollution, would provide more than half of India's power for the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming decades, as India works to provide access to electricity to more than 300 million people, its emissions are projected to double, surpassing those of the United States and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As President Obama and Chinese leaders have signaled that they intend to enact policies to decrease their emissions levels in the coming years, cooperation from India on a global climate treaty is crucial. Without India, it will be more difficult to reach a lasting agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As demand for electricity surges in India, Mr. Modi has said he plans to tackle climate&nbsp;change by increasing renewable power sources like wind and solar -- an effort that has won applause from international environmental groups. Mr. Javadekar said his government was also focusing on increasing investment in railways and public transport, in order to slow the growth in demand for cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said the Modi administration was working on efforts to replant forests and create new wildlife refuge areas to protect tigers. ''The new motto is, development without destruction,'' Mr. Javadekar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of recent scientific reports have concluded that carbon emissions must peak within the next few years, and then decline, if the global atmosphere is to avoid an average temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius, a tipping point at which scientists project an unavoidable future of rising sea levels, increased droughts and flooding and other catastrophic impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has pushed for policies to lower emissions in the United States, and on Tuesday, the vice prime minister of China, Zhang Gaoli, said his country would try to reach a peak level of emissions ''as soon as possible.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Food news for Climate Week. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Manhattan to Melbourne to war-torn Aleppo, at least half a million people (and more than a few polar bears) participated in 2,700 simultaneous climate events around the world on Sunday to demand action on climate change. In New York, organizers estimate nearly 400,000 people turned out for the People's Climate March, on the eve of the U.N. Climate Summit. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the summit will deliver anything of substance is another story - I'm not optimistic. But mass public pressure on individuals in power can make a difference, and already the activity surrounding Climate Week is starting to show results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rockefeller family has announced that its $860 million charity - built on the slick back of Standard Oil - will be divesting its assets from fossil fuels, adding a highly symbolic name to a movement begun on college campuses. (Harvard, the college with the largest endowment, is still holding out.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, attempting to revive his somewhat wilted leftie credentials, called for &quot;urgent, daring action&quot; on climate change in a speech at the U.N. He reiterated his administration's plan to cut the city's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, two days after damning new reports found global emissions accelerated in 2013. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private sector is getting involved, too. Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Brands will no longer source palm oil for frying their doughnuts from suppliers who are clear-cutting rainforests. Significantly, forty companies - including behemoths like Kellogg and Nestl&eacute; - signed a declaration on Tuesday pledging to help cut tropical deforestation in half by 2020 and stop it entirely by 2030. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, the Department of Agriculture and other agencies are being asked to take ecological concerns into account when recommending what Americans should be putting on their plates. That means a lot less meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Monsanto is taking steps to improve its image by giving private tours of its farms (and $150) to &quot;mommy bloggers&quot; who the company hopes will peddle its shtick that it's not just in it for the money, it's trying to feed a growing planet. Please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Soda is also hopping on the feel-good-announcements train. Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group pledged to cut America's calorie intake from beverages by 20 percent over the next decade, basically admitting that their products are poison. If they really wanted to help, they could stop blocking soda taxes and efforts to put warning labels on their vehicles for sugar. (Which, by the way, actually work: Mexico just announced its soda tax has reduced consumption by 10 percent.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally: Here are 24 different recipes for challah (and one of my own). Happy Rosh Hashanah. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As world leaders meet today at the United Nations in New York, they will face intense pressure to act. The discovery that North Korea has been secretly pumping climate-altering chemicals into the atmosphere in an attempt to destroy agricultural production across the US has sparked an international crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not true, of course. There is indeed a summit this week, called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, to discuss dangerous climatic disruption. It's a disruption that may in fact lead to the collapse of many of the world's main agricultural regions. But since it's only dull old global warming, a subject swaths of the public seem to find less interesting than watching paint dry, the politicians don't have to worry too much about being held to account.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why can we be confident that the North Korean scenario would lead to rapid political mobilisation while the huge threat we really do face will generate mere empty promises? This raises a larger question about our own psychology: why do most people understand that climate&nbsp;change is a major threat yet, when asked to name the greatest dangers to civilisation, still seem unable to bring it to mind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary reason is that our innate sense of social competition has made us acutely alert to any threat posed by external enemies. In experiments, children as young as three can tell the difference between an accident and a deliberate attack. Climate&nbsp;change confounds this core moral formula: it is a perfect and undetectable crime everyone contributes to but for which no one has a motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no outsider to blame. We are just living our lives: driving the kids to school, heating our homes, putting food on the table. Only once we accept the threat of climate&nbsp;change do these neutral acts become poisoned with intention - so we readily reject that knowledge, or react to it with anger and resentment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse, climate&nbsp;change appears to contain a royal flush of other qualities that are notoriously hard for our brains to engage with: it requires immediate personal sacrifices now to avoid uncertain collective losses far in the future. The cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel prize for his studies of how irrationally we respond to such issues, sighed deeply when I asked him to assess our chances: &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;I am deeply pessimistic. I see no path to success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would agree with him if indeed climate&nbsp;change really were uncertain, impossibly expensive to combat and located in the far future. It can easily seem so, if that's how you are determined to frame it. However, many economists, such as Nicholas Stern and Hank Paulson, George W Bush's former treasury secretary, see it differently. So do the 310,000 protesters who jammed 30 blocks of Manhattan, and the tens of thousands more in London on Sunday shouting with heartfelt conviction that climate&nbsp;change is real, happening now and entirely actionable. For them the real obstacle - memorably represented on one float in New York as a 15 metre-long octopus - is the oil and gas industry and its tentacles of political influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And herein lies the real challenge. Climate&nbsp;change can be anything you want it to be. It can be here or there, in the present or the future, certain and uncertain. It seems that we see climate&nbsp;change as a threat - and are therefore able to harness that innate reaction to an external enemy - only once it is poured into the mould of our familiar stories, with their heroes and villains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So my fellow advocates for action create this enemy narrative with dramatis personae from our past struggles - corrupt politicians, malignant corporate executives, fat bankers, lazy journalists, slippery lawyers and an apathetic public. All the while, however, our opponents are mirroring these actions. During a raucous evening with the Texan Tea Party I was told in predictably blunt language that liberal environmentalists are the real enemy, and that we have invented this scam to extend government control. Like most conservatives, they failed to see that it is climate&nbsp;change itself that poses a threat to their values, freedoms and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tendency to confuse the facts of climate&nbsp;change with the narratives constructed from them is just as common among politicians. I can safely predict that the leaders gathering in New York will stress the urgent need to control greenhouse gases but remain mute about the $1,000bn a year spent bringing yet more fossil fuel reserves into production. In 25 years of negotiations, no measure to control fossil fuel production has ever been discussed. It does not exist anywhere in the official narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the general public too there are gaps and blind spots. Most people have never discussed climate&nbsp;change with anyone outside their immediate family. A third cannot recall having talked about it with anyone at all. And, counter-intuitively, climate-related trauma seems to make people even more reticent. Speaking to the victims of Hurricane Sandy and the 2011 Texan drought and wildfires, I could not find anyone who could recall a recent conversation with their neighbours about climate&nbsp;change. Battered communities, it seems, find strength in the hope of recovery, and actively suppress any disheartening discussion of underlying causes or future threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if we are to really mobilise action on climate&nbsp;change it is vital that we recognise that it exists in two forms: the scientific facts, and the far more potent social facts of constructed narratives or deliberate silence. It is the latter that provide the basis on which we accept, deny or ignore the issue, reinforced by our innate need to conform to the norm within our social group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seen in this light, the situation is far from hopeless. Like the cycles that govern global energy and carbon systems, public attitudes are subject to positive feedback effects that can amplify small changes and result in rapid shifts. Strong visible protest and increased media coverage can break the climate silence and create wider engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, though, we need to recognise that the narrative we choose will shape what happens from now on. We may continue to fall back on our need for an enemy. But the very best story would be one of common purpose, based around our shared humanity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France promised $1bn to a near-empty climate&nbsp;change fund for poor countries yesterday and called for the establishment of a new green economy in the first concrete result of a milestone United Nations summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pledge came on a day of impassioned speeches from some 120 presidents and prime ministers - as well as a cameo by the actor and now UN ambassador Leonardo DiCaprio - telling the summit they had wasted precious time and now needed to deal urgently with climate&nbsp;change. Both China and America, the world's two biggest emitters, pledged their support for a climate deal, without offering specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese vice-premier Zhang Gaoli said his country's emissions would peak &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, and pledged $6m to help developing countries fight climate&nbsp;change. Barack Obama, in a stirring address, said America would lead efforts to reach a global compact on climate&nbsp;change. &quot;We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate&nbsp;change and the last to be able to do anything about it,&quot; he told the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron touted his government's environmental policies. &quot;As prime minister I pledged to lead the greenest government ever and I believe we have kept that promise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But leaders from Africa and the Pacific islands threatened by rising seas said rich countries needed to do more. &quot;We must get away from the 'wait and see who is doing what' style of leadership before deciding what needs to be done,&quot; said Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, which could be drowned by rising seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit - the first such gathering of world leaders in five years - was convened to move countries towards an international agreement in Paris to fight climate&nbsp;change by the end of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French leader, Francois Hollande, said it would be impossible to reach such a deal without laying the foundations of a new green economy. &quot;You can't fight climate&nbsp;change without development,&quot; he said, pledging $1bn (&pound;600m) to a fund to help poor countries deal with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green Climate Fund was founded in 2010. UN officials and developing-country diplomats have said repeatedly it will not be possible to reach a deal in Paris without a significant fund for the countries which did the least to cause climate&nbsp;change but will bear the brunt of its effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials had been hoping to raise $10bn to $15bn by the end of the year. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made the first significant pledge last July, committing $1bn. South Korea, which hosts the fund, also committed $100m yesterday. But the fund remains well below its goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York warned a United Nations summit meeting on climate change on Tuesday about the ''reckless way in which we live,'' and of the dangers of humanity's dependence on fossil fuel consumption and other environmentally damaging habits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reiterating a plan by his administration to reduce the city's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 80 percent over the next four decades, Mr. de Blasio called for ''urgent, daring action'' and said he expected to cooperate with leaders of other cities and countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor spoke at the early morning opening ceremony of the daylong summit, welcoming those who attended in a half-empty General Assembly hall. He was one of several speakers scheduled for Tuesday morning, including Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general; former Vice President Al Gore; and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We know humanity is facing an existential threat,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''The cause is us: how we heat our homes, how we transport ourselves, the reckless way in which we live. This is an issue we all face -- no one is spared -- and our mutual need to survive should instill in us a kind of unity we too rarely experience.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de Blasio spoke for less than three minutes; his prepared remarks were 354 words long. He praised the efforts of his predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to combat greenhouse gas emissions in New York. But Mr. de Blasio said his own environmental plan, which he described as ''bold,'' would ''go even further.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, more than 100 world leaders gathered at the United Nations to open a climate summit meeting that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hopes will provide momentum to a new round of negotiations toward a global environmental agreement to be signed in Paris next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're forgiven if you hold your applause. World leaders have been trying without success to cut such a deal for almost two decades, crashing time and again into the fear that slowing the emissions of carbon that are inexorably changing the climate carries an economic cost that few are willing to bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, though, advocates come armed with a trump card: All things considered, the cost of curbing carbon emissions may be considerably cheaper than earlier estimates had suggested. For all the fears that climate&nbsp;change mitigation would put the brakes on growth, it might actually enhance it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this can tip the balance toward the global grand bargain that has eluded world leaders so many times depends on a couple of things. The first is to what extent it is true. The second is whether this is, in fact, the issue that matters most to the people making the decisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent salvo came in ''The New Climate Economy,'' a report issued last week by an international commission appointed by a handful of rich and poor countries to take a new look at the economics of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is now huge scope for action which can both enhance growth and reduce climate risk,'' it reads. Efficient investments could deliver at least half of the emission cuts needed by 2030 to keep global temperatures in check. And they could do so while delivering extra economic gains on the side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first blush, the proposition that replacing fossil fuel with more expensive energy could produce a net economic gain seems implausible. Until now, even many supporters of tough action accepted the idea that there would be a necessary price to pay initially to achieve the long-term goal of avoiding catastrophic climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new thinking turns that on its head by taking more careful account of the hidden benefits of mitigating climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The cost of action is well known,'' said Helen Mountford, director of economics at the World Resources Institute, which worked on the ''New Climate Economy'' report. ''The co-benefits, like reduced health costs, are less known.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are not isolated. Research published this month by Ian Parry and Chandara Veung of the International Monetary Fund and Dirk Heine of the University of Bologna concluded that almost every one of the top 20 carbon emitters would reap economic gains by imposing a hefty carbon tax, if they deployed the revenue to reduce taxes on income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax of $63 per ton of CO2, for instance, would not only cut China's emissions by some 17 percent, it would also cut the number of Chinese sickened or killed by pollution from coal. If Beijing used the money to cut other taxes, it would increase economic efficiency, adding up to a net economic gain -- on top of any climate impact -- of more than 1 percent of China's gross domestic product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This finding does not depend on any technological breakthroughs. It happens whether solar energy is cheap or expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's only recently that policy makers are beginning to appreciate the power of fiscal instruments like environmental taxes,'' Mr. Parry told me. ''And it's only fairly recently that we've been able to value the health and other environment impacts so we've only recently got some sense of the substantial and pervasive undercharging for environmental damages.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this is all theory, some empirical research also supports the finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, for instance, the Canadian province of British Columbia unilaterally imposed a carbon tax that rose from 10 Canadian dollars per ton of CO2 in 2010 to 30 dollars in 2012, using the money to reduce personal and corporate income taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assessment of the experience published last year by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that fuel use declined, but economic growth remained on the same trajectory as the rest of Canada's. Notably, British Columbia ended up with the lowest income tax in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could this new understanding change the debate over climate&nbsp;change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least, the belief that there is a climate-related free lunch out there might provide welcome harmony to negotiations that usually end in acrimonious finger-pointing. The new research might even help move the debate away from the failed strategy of seeking legally binding emissions targets on every country, providing a blueprint for countries to voluntarily take on ambitious goals because it is in their own self-interest regardless of what other nations do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everybody buys the math, though. And even those who do acknowledge that these efficient pathways to a low-carbon future are very narrow indeed. ''Not all climate policies are win-win, and some trade-offs are inevitable,'' notes ''The New Climate Economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For even if every country reaped net benefits from embracing a low-carbon development path, governments still must allocate costs and benefits within individual economies, mediating between winners and losers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Health is a social benefit that is not included in the accounts of private investors,'' noted Zou Ji, deputy director of China's National Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Strategy, a research institute affiliated with the government's National Development and Reform Commission. ''But abatement costs will be felt by private investors.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigating these distributional issues will be tricky. Getting it wrong can be expensive. For instance, Mr. Parry and his co-researchers found that if carbon revenue was not used to reduce other income taxes, the net gain from a carbon tax evaporated and became a net cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany -- perhaps the country most committed to developing an economy powered with renewable energy -- has struggled with the trade-offs. First it exempted its export-oriented, energy-intensive industries from the surcharges levied to pay for subsidies to solar and wind generators. More recently, alarmed at the rising cost of power, it has begun reducing its subsidies for renewables, which has led to a drop in the rollout of solar power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe it's no surprise that few countries have been willing, at least so far, to commit to take the promised high growth/low carbon path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last July, Australia's newly installed conservative government repealed the carbon tax introduced by the Labor government before it, and the country's carbon emissions quickly shot up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the Chinese and the Indians found it much more economically efficient to build out solar, nuclear and wind, why are they still building all these coal plants?'' asked Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank focused on development and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's CO2 emissions increased 4.2 percent last year, according to the Global Carbon Project, helping drive a global increase of 2.3 percent. China now accounts for 28 percent of the world's total emissions, more than the United States and the European Union combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think the Chinese and the Indians are stupid,'' Mr. Nordhaus told me. ''They are looking at their indigenous energy resources and energy demand and making fairly reasonable decisions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them, combating climate&nbsp;change does not look at all like a free lunch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With political efforts to slow global warming moving at a tortuous pace, some of the world's largest companies are stepping into the void, pledging more support for renewable energy, greener supply chains and fresh efforts to stop the destruction of the world's tropical forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty companies, among them Kellogg, L'Or&eacute;al and Nestl&eacute;, signed a declaration on Tuesday pledging to help cut tropical deforestation in half by 2020 and stop it entirely by 2030. They included several of the largest companies handling palm oil, the production of which has resulted in rampant destruction of old-growth forests, especially in Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a United Nations climate summit in New York this week, companies are playing a larger role than at any such gathering in the past -- and issuing a blizzard of promises. Several environmental groups said they were optimistic that at least some of these would be kept, but they warned that corporate action was not enough, and that climate&nbsp;change could not be solved without stronger steps by governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate promises are the culmination of a trend that has been building for years, with virtually every major company now feeling obliged to make commitments about environmental sustainability, and to report regularly on progress. The companies have found that pursuing such goals can often help them cut costs, particularly for energy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology companies are at the forefront of this week's announcements, in part because their own employees have been demanding action on climate issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple, which has won plaudits from environmental groups for supporting renewable power in the United States, said that it would start focusing on emissions at its suppliers, which are mainly located abroad and account for some 70 percent of the greenhouse gases that come from production and use of the company's products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're really turning our attention now to the supply chain in a major way,'' Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said on Monday in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple, Google and Facebook, which did not sign the forest pledge as their industries have little connection to deforestation, have all made strong commitments to power their huge, electricity-hungry data centers with renewable power. They sometimes build their own solar or wind arrays, but have also demanded that power companies in places like Iowa and North Carolina generate and sell them renewable power as a condition of putting new facilities in those states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cook, in his most forceful statements yet about the environment, rejected the idea that society must choose between economic growth and environmental protection. He pointed to a huge solar farm his company built in North Carolina to help power a data center there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People told us it couldn't happen, it couldn't be done, but we did it,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It's great for the environment, and by the way it's also good for economics.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another indicator of how focused the companies have become on ecological issues, Google said this week that it would withdraw from the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative-leaning group that has urged repeal of state renewable power standards and other pro-renewable policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a radio interview, the company's executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, said that people opposed to climate action ''are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. And so we should not be aligned with such people -- they're just, they're just literally lying.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Lisa B. Nelson, chief executive of the legislative council, said it was ''unfortunate'' that Google would withdraw, adding that the decision was ''a result of public pressure from left-leaning individuals and organizations who intentionally confuse free-market policy perspectives for climate&nbsp;change denial.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of this week's promises focused on the supply chain for major commodities like soybeans, beef and palm oil, often produced on cleared forest land in the tropics. The destruction of these forests imperils some of the earth's richest biological regions, endangering animals like tigers, elephants and orangutans. The trees are generally burned, sending vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, which worsens global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazil has made progress in slowing the destruction of the Amazon, but deforestation in Indonesia remains an acute problem, in part because the production of palm oil there is so lucrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's declaration on forests was also endorsed by 32 governments, by numerous advocacy groups and by organizations representing indigenous people. Among corporations, it also included consumer goods companies that have pledged to impose tough standards on their suppliers of the oil, an ingredient in thousands of everyday products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cargill, the huge American commodity processor, went even further, extending a previous no-deforestation pledge that it had made on palm oil and soybeans to cover every commodity the company handles -- one of the most sweeping environmental pledges ever made by a large agricultural company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want to make sure we are treating the environment with respect,'' David W. MacLennan, the company's chief executive, said in an interview. ''It's the right thing to do for the planet, for indigenous peoples, for our customers and for our employees.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major Indonesian palm oil processors, including Cargill, issued a separate declaration on Tuesday pledging a crackdown on deforestation, and asking the Indonesian government to adopt stronger laws. Forest Heroes, an environmental group, called the declaration ''a watershed moment in the history of both Indonesia and global agriculture. We should not underestimate the significance of what is happening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the leading company in trying to clean up the palm oil business has been Unilever, which took action several years ago after being targeted in demonstrations by Greenpeace, the environmental group. Unilever, which owns brands like Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap, Lipton tea and Hellmann's mayonnaise, has pledged that it will be able to trace all its palm oil to known sources by the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another major commitment, five large refrigeration companies said on Tuesday that they would form a global coalition to seek improvements in the huge refrigerators used in grocery stores, fast-food chains and the like. One goal will be to phase out a type of refrigerant that acts as a powerful greenhouse gas when it escapes to the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview in New York, Kumi Naidoo, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said that his group and others would be watching to see that the corporate promises made this week were kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Naidoo said he believed the leaders of some companies were sincere in wanting to tackle global warming, singling out the head of Unilever, Paul Polman. But he added that their efforts would only go so far without stronger action by governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We cannot just depend on the good will of corporate leaders,'' Mr. Naidoo said. ''The situation is too urgent now.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS -- President Obama, emboldened by his use of executive powers to fight climate&nbsp;change at home, challenged China on Tuesday to make the same effort to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and join a worldwide campaign to curb global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaring that the United States and China -- the world's two largest economies and largest polluters -- bear a ''special responsibility to lead,'' Mr. Obama said, ''That's what big nations have to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's remarks at the United Nations Climate Summit, delivered in a packed chamber of the General Assembly, were broadly aimed at marshaling more than 100 world leaders to confront climate&nbsp;change. But his words were directly focused on putting the onus on China, an essential partner of the United States if a global climate treaty is to be negotiated by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless Beijing and Washington can resolve their differences, climate experts said, few other countries will agree to the treaty and it will most likely founder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama made it clear that after taking the political risks in June of proposing a far-reaching Environmental Protection Agency regulation to force American power plants to curb their carbon emissions, he now expected the Chinese to do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were indications that China might be ready with its own plan, although many experts say they will be skeptical until Chinese officials reveal the details. The decision of President Xi Jinping of China to skip the summit meeting also sent a less-than-enthusiastic message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a senior Chinese official sent in Mr. Xi's place said his country would try to reach a peak level of carbon emissions ''as early as possible.'' That suggested that the Chinese government, struggling with air pollution so extreme that it has threatened economic growth, regularly kept millions of children indoors and ignited street protests, was determined to show faster progress in curbing emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As a responsible major developing country, China will make an even greater effort to address climate&nbsp;change and take on international responsibilities that are commensurate with our national conditions,'' said the official, Vice Prime Minister Zhang Gaoli, who addressed the chamber after Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and Mr. Zhang met briefly at the summit meeting on Tuesday, before Mr. Obama's speech. In his remarks, Mr. Obama said he had pressed Mr. Zhang on the urgency for both countries to take the lead, and noted that he and the Chinese president had already reached an accord to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent category of greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, he said, would meet a pledge to reduce its carbon emissions by 17 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2020 -- a goal that is in large part expected to be met through the proposed E.P.A. regulation. Now, Mr. Obama said, the United States is preparing ambitious new targets to cut emissions further by 2050, with specifics to be made public ahead of a climate summit meeting in Paris in 2015. Other nations are expected to submit their own plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its surging use of coal, China has overtaken the United States as the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter. But in the past year, as thousands of Chinese have protested the reliance on coal and its contribution to some of the world's dirtiest air, Chinese authorities have signaled that they intend to adopt policies to reduce the use of coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've been working hard on this plan, looking at what kind of changes we will make to industry,'' Li Junfeng, director general of China's National Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Strategy, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Li said that his center had prepared ''multiple choice'' options for a proposed climate plan, and that Beijing would choose one to put forth based on the perceived stringency of the American plan for emissions cuts by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, the Chinese government has sent other signals about addressing carbon pollution, some of them encouraging to environmental experts. It has created seven regional cap-and-trade plans aimed at cutting carbon pollution from coal plants, and in August, a Chinese government official suggested that China was exploring the possibility of a national cap-and-trade plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Five years ago, it was almost unimaginable to discuss China putting a cap on carbon, but now that is happening,'' said Lo Sze Ping, chief executive officer of the World Wildlife Fund's office in Beijing. ''Chinese leaders have seen that it is imperative to move toward a low-carbon economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modest Chinese steps are ahead of some other major polluters who are unlikely to submit emission-cuts plans ahead of 2015. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remains an outspoken skeptic of climate-change science, and voters in Australia recently repealed a national carbon tax. India, the world's third-largest carbon polluter, has so far resisted outside pressure to cut its coal use, although under its new prime minister, Narendra Modi, it has begun researching a plan. Without new climate policies, India is projected to surge ahead of the United States and China in carbon emissions in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, the climate summit was the first time he had spoken to such a gathering, having enacted a significant carbon cutting plan. In urging other countries to take steps, Mr. Obama pointed to his E.P.A. regulation to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the No. 1 source of greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There should be no question that the United States of America is stepping up to the plate,'' he said. ''We recognize our role in creating this problem; we embrace our responsibility to combat it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who sought to erase years of skepticism abroad about American resolve to tackle climate&nbsp;change, reminded his audience that his action carried a political cost: At home, Republicans and the coal industry deride the new rules as a ''war on coal'' and an energy tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reciting a litany of record-setting temperatures and natural disasters, Mr. Obama warned that the climate was changing faster than the world's response to it. Recent efforts to curb the problem, he said, would fail without more cooperation from countries around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can only succeed in combating climate&nbsp;change if we are joined in this effort by every nation, developed and developing alike,'' the president said. ''Nobody gets a pass.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If strong carbon-cutting policies are not enacted quickly, scientists warn, the current trajectory of fossil fuel emissions will raise the temperature of the global atmosphere by two degrees Celsius, a tipping point that is projected to lead to a future of rising sea levels, extreme droughts and food shortages, floods and more powerful storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To reach a deal by the end of 2015, United Nations officials said, countries must unveil concrete plans by April 1 that are to specify how they will cut their energy-related fossil fuel pollution after 2020. To be taken seriously, the plans must show how the governments will enforce disruptive shifts to their economies, transitioning away from the fossil fuels that have powered their homes and vehicles for a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists said they were encouraged by the prospect of new climate policies, but warned that for now, the efforts under discussion would not be enough to prevent the first ravages of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the world that we live in, this is probably the best we can do right now,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. ''It's worth the effort. But it's not going to solve the problem. It's not going to get us to two degrees. It's not even enough to stave off three degrees.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scolding the powerful and the power-hungry, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, opened the 69th annual session of the General Assembly on Wednesday morning, in a 13-minute speech that rued the state of the world, from the conflict in Ukraine to the bombing of United Nations schools in Gaza to beheadings in Iraq and Syria - all before warning of the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a terrible year for the principles of the United Nations Charter,&quot; he said. &quot;From barrel bombs to beheadings, from the deliberate starvation of civilians to the assault on hospitals, U.N. shelters and aid convoys, human rights and the rule of law are under attack.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual gathering, expected to draw 140 heads of state and government over the course of the next six days, convenes in the shadow of U.S.-led airstrikes on Syria and Iraq and a swiftly widening disease outbreak in West Africa, one of the most fragile corners of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban was followed by Dilma Rousseff, the president of Brazil, which is customarily the first state to address the hall. She will be followed by President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly Hall reopened this year after a yearlong face-liftto get rid of the grime and smoke that had accumulated since 1952, the year it was built, and to make it more energy efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year the horizon of hope is darkened,&quot; Mr. Ban said. &quot;Our hearts and minds are made heavy by unspeakable acts and the deaths of innocents. Cold War ghosts have returned to haunt our times. We have seen so much of the Arab Spring go violently wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban's speech was delivered in a mix of English and French. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made a passionate pitch for women's rights, which is one of his signature issues. &quot;We cannot fulfill 100 percent of the world's potential by excluding 50 percent of the world's people,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His address referred to the new chasm between Israel and Palestinians, instability in Ukraine, new conflicts in Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the threat of terrorist groups in Mali, Somalia and Nigeria. The extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, he said, have sunk to &quot;new depths of barbarity with each passing day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speech echoed his remarks from Tuesday, when he offered an implicit nod to the United States-led airstrikes on Syria. &quot;These extremist groups are a clear threat to international peace and security that requires a multifaceted international response,&quot; he said. &quot;We need decisive action to stop atrocity crimes and frank discussion on what created the threat in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rebuked the world powers that control the Security Council, the most influential organ in the United Nations system, which has been deadlocked on some of the most crucial peace and security issues. Syria has been the most glaring example. The gulf between Russia - a staunch ally of the government in Damascus - and the West has made consensus impossible. &quot;Continued disunity over Syria has resulted in grave human suffering and loss of credibility for the Council and our institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tried to make the case for why the United Nations can be relevant - even necessary. He reminded the assembly that the world was on track to meet ambitious targets to cut poverty and child deaths. He nudged them to come to &quot;meaningful, universal&quot; agreement on climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban saved the issue of fighting Ebola for last. He said the outbreak in West Africa needs a &quot;20-fold surge in care, tracking, transport and equipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has established an emergency mission to contain the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we face a profusion of mounting challenges,&quot; he said. &quot;People are crying out for protection from greed and inequality. The United Nations must answer the call.&quot;                       </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US secretary of state, John Kerry, promised to put climate&nbsp;change &quot;front and centre&quot; of American diplomacy yesterday, raising expectations on the eve of a United Nations summit on the global threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world's prime ministers and presidents began arriving in New York yesterday for the first leaders' meeting on climate&nbsp;change in five years, Kerry said he would take it on himself to make sure the international community steps up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an enormous challenge, and this is why the United States is prepared to take the lead in order to bring other nations to the table,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;As secretary of state, I promise you I am personally committed to making sure this is front and centre of all our diplomatic efforts.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commitment offered much-needed encouragement before today's UN summit. More than 120 world leaders are expected to attend. But a high-level roster of no-shows, with big carbon polluters such as China, India, Australia and Canada staying away, and the lack of a defined objective have raised doubts that the gathering will produce concrete results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued in New York's financial district yesterday, a day after more than 310,000 marched through the city's streets, including the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, foreign ministers and celebrities, and demonstrations were held in dozens of cities across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban said he had been deeply moved. &quot;I am overwhelmed by such a strong power, energy and voice of people - I hope this voice will be truly reflected to the leaders when they meet . . . Climate&nbsp;change is (a) defining issue of our time and there is no time to lose,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no plan B because we do not have planet B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses and NGOs are primed to unveil a host of new initiatives meant to speed the development of a low-carbon, clean-energy economy. The World Bank yesterday announced that about 73 national governments - including China, Russia and the European Union - had agreed to put a price on carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate initiative, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a charitable institution set up by the heirs to the oil empire, said it would phase out its holdings in fossil fuels, in an important symbolic boost to a campaign which has seen the withdrawal of about $50bn (&pound;31bn) in fossil fuel assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of governments and organisations are expected to announce other initiatives at the summit to reduce areas lost to deforestation, especially through the cultivation of palm oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry's remarks suggested the Obama administration will remain focused on climate until late 2015, when negotiators are expected to gather in Paris to finalise a deal to cut carbon emissions and help poor countries deal with global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is expected to reaffirm that commitment in his remarks today. The president will also hold up his initiatives to cut carbon pollution from power plants and from cars as evidence the US is taking climate&nbsp;change seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry noted that the US had been working closely with China to reduce emissions - an effort that resulted in an agreement last year to phase out the use of a powerful climate-warming HFC used in air conditioners and refrigerators. The two countries together are responsible for 45% of the world's carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've sent a directive to every single one of our 275 missions, embassies and consulates that the chiefs of missions are to put this issue on the front burner in all of our interventions with host countries, wherever they may be,&quot; Kerry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US will not, however, be offering significant sums of cash to help poor countries deal with climate&nbsp;change. Developing countries have said such a commitment is crucial to securing a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of engagement from Kerry follows assurances from UN officials and diplomats that today's summit - and the climate&nbsp;change negotiating session in Lima in November - will avoid earlier mistakes. A similar leaders' summit convened by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in 2009 failed to produce the understanding needed to forge a climate deal. The Copenhagen summit collapsed three months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Robinson, the US special envoy on climate&nbsp;change, said the UN would not fall into that trap again. &quot;This is a different environment to Copenhagen,&quot; the former Irish president said. &quot;Pressure on leaders for an agreement is building up more than 12 months ahead. I think leaders realise they need to have transformative change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson played down concerns that China and India had snubbed the secretary-general's meeting, as neither Chinese president Xi Jinping and India's prime minister Narendra Modi are planning to go. &quot;China (is sending) a very, very senior participant,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for oil, there may not have been a Rockefeller fortune. John and William Rockefeller were the co-founders of the Standard Oil Company in 1870, which at the time operated the world's biggest refineries, and over time spawned Exxon, Amoco and Chevron.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after a year of deliberations, the descendants of those original Rockefellers have withdrawn their funds from fossil fuel investments, lending a symbolic boost to a $50bn (&pound;30bn) divestment campaign ahead of the UN summit on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rockefeller Brothers Fund controls about $860m in assets, said Beth Dorsey, the chief executive of the Wallace Global Fund and the Divest-Invest movement, which has led the divestment campaign. About 7% are invested in fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Rockefellers' decision to cut their ties with oil lends the divestment campaign huge symbolic importance because of their family history. It also helps bring a campaign launched by scrappy activists on college campuses into the financial mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John D Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, moved America out of whale oil and into petroleum,&quot; Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, said in a statement. &quot;We are quite convinced that if he were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Rockefellers, the World Council of Churches, which represents 590 million people in 150 countries, also pulled its investments from fossil fuels yesterday. The move represented a turning point for a campaign which began by demanding that universities purge their financial holdings of ties to the fossil fuel industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With yesterday's announcements, more than 800 global investors - including foundations, religious groups, healthcare organisations, cities and universities - have pledged to withdraw a total of $50bn from fossil fuel investments over the next five years. About 30 US cities have chosen to divest, including Santa Monica and Seattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have the Rockefellers and the World Council of Churches and institutions with global reach coming together and divesting, then this movement which began just three short years ago has really reached a significant turning point,&quot; Dorsey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that time, supporters such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu have framed divestment from fossil fuels as a moral imperative - like the anti-apartheid movement of a generation ago. &quot;Climate&nbsp;change is the human rights challenge of our time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US secretary of state, John Kerry, promised to put climate&nbsp;change &quot;front and centre&quot; of American diplomacy yesterday, raising expectations on the eve of a United Nations summit on the global threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world's prime ministers and presidents began arriving in New York yesterday for the first leaders' meeting on climate&nbsp;change in five years, Kerry said he would take it on himself to make sure that the international community steps up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an enormous challenge, and this is why the United States is prepared to take the lead in order to bring other nations to the table,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;As secretary of state, I promise you I am personally committed to making sure this is front and centre of all our diplomatic efforts.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commitment offered much needed encouragement before today's UN summit. More than 120 world leaders are expected to attend, but a high-level roster of no-shows, with big carbon polluters such as China, India, Australia and Canada staying away, and the lack of a defined objective have raised doubts that the gathering will produce concrete results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests continued in New York's financial district yesterday. Hundreds blocked streets near the stock exchange, stopping traffic at one point, in a protest against the role of high finance in raising money for businesses that contribute to climate&nbsp;change. Three people were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration came a day after 310,000 people, including the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, marched through the city's streets, and demonstrations were held across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban said he had been deeply moved. &quot;I am overwhelmed by such a strong power, energy and voice of people . . . Climate&nbsp;change is (a) defining issue of our time,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no plan B because we do not have planet B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses and NGOs are primed to unveil a host of new initiatives meant to speed the development of a low-carbon, clean-energy economy. The World Bank yesterday announced that 73 national governments - including China, Russia and the European Union - had agreed to put a price on carbon and more than 1,000 companies supported the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate initiative, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a charitable institution set up by the heirs to the oil empire, said it would phase out its holdings in fossil fuels, in an important symbolic boost to a campaign that has seen the withdrawal of about $50bn (&pound;31bn) in fossil fuel assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of governments and organisations are expected to announce other initiatives at the summit to reduce areas lost to deforestation, especially through the cultivation of palm oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry's remarks suggested the Obama administration will remain focused on climate until late 2015, when negotiators are expected to gather in Paris to finalise a deal to cut carbon emissions and help poor countries deal with global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is expected to reaffirm that commitment today. The president will also hold up his initiatives to cut carbon pollution from power plants and from cars as evidence that the US is taking climate&nbsp;change seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry noted that the US had been working closely with China to reduce emissions - an effort that resulted in an agreement last year to phase out the use of a powerful climate-warming HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) used in air conditioners and refrigerators. Together, the two countries are responsible for 45% of carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've sent a directive to every single one of our 275 missions, embassies and consulates that the chiefs of missions are to put this issue on the front burner in all of our interventions with host countries, wherever they may be,&quot; Kerry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US will not, however, be offering significant sums of cash to help poor countries deal with climate&nbsp;change. Developing countries have said such a commitment is crucial to securing a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry's promise follows assurances from UN officials and diplomats that today's summit - and the climate&nbsp;change negotiating session in Lima in November - will avoid earlier mistakes. A similar summit convened by Ban Ki-Moon in 2009 failed to produce an understanding needed for a climate deal. The Copenhagen summit collapsed three months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Robinson, the UN special envoy on climate&nbsp;change, said the UN would not fall into that trap again. &quot;This is a different environment,&quot; the former Irish president said. &quot;Pressure on leaders for an agreement is building up more than 12 months ahead. I think leaders realise they need to have transformative change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson played down concerns that China and India had snubbed the meeting, as neither Chinese president Xi Jinping nor India's prime minister Narendra Modi are attending. &quot;China (is sending) a very senior participant,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for oil, there may not have been a Rockefeller fortune. John and William Rockefeller were the co-founders of the Standard Oil Company in 1870, which at the time operated the world's biggest refineries, and over time spawned Exxon, Amoco and Chevron.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after a year of deliberations, the descendants of those original Rockefellers have withdrawn their funds from fossil fuel investments, lending a symbolic boost to a $50bn (&pound;30bn) divestment campaign ahead of the UN summit on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rockefeller Brothers Fund controls about $860m in assets, said Beth Dorsey, the chief executive of the Wallace Global Fund and the Divest-Invest movement, which has led the divestment campaign. About 7% are invested in fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Rockefellers' decision to cut their ties with oil lends the divestment campaign huge symbolic importance because of their family history. It also helps bring a campaign launched by scrappy activists on college campuses into the financial mainstream.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellesmere Island, Nunavut -- It's August, and there's snow on the ground. The six-week summer has already passed; our 24-hour daylight will drop to 16 in just a month's time. Small, brittle leaves crunch underfoot as I walk across tundra that's already beginning to freeze for the long winter ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top of the world is a cold place. I've been at a field camp here in the Canadian high Arctic gathering climate&nbsp;change data from one of the most remote and isolated regions of the planet. It is barren, wild and beautiful. Yet this place is not beyond the reach of our carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The land up here is warming faster than most of the planet. The 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change report projected that the Arctic would warm much more rapidly than the global average, with warming over the land far greater than over the ocean. And it is a particularly sensitive land, where a diverse array of birds, mammals, and plants eke out an existence through eight months of winter while relying on a delicate balance of summer temperatures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a doctoral candidate at McGill University in Montreal, I have spent three years researching how the planet's changing climate is affecting the polar desert ecology of the high Arctic. It's precisely this balance of climate and permafrost, ice and ecosystems that I've come here to study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this wide-open space, with all its dangers and difficulties, lies a land that is deservedly called the Garden Spot of the Arctic. More than 600 miles north of Alaska, it harbors more than 150 species of brightly flowering plants. This is where the North American continent has ended and broken into a disjointed network of islands, some of the largest and least explored on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a difficult place to call home. The polar desert differs from the lower Arctic by its extreme dryness, relative lack of plant life, and brutally cold winters. It would remind me of Middle Eastern deserts -- dusty soil, dry riverbeds, spattered flecks of vegetation, beautiful rock formations -- if it were not surrounded by towering mountains and ice caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vast stretches of flat, dry desert are cracked by the harsh winters into miles of patterned ground. The winter shatters the land into an array of shapes -- polygonal patterns that repeat endlessly over vast distances. They are underlain by massive bodies of buried ice that sit in a fine equilibrium with the surrounding permafrost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permafrost occurs in polar and alpine areas where the ground temperature remains below 32 degrees Fahrenheit for many years. But as the planet warms, permafrost can thaw. Together with the melting of ground ice (known as thermokarst), it creates the potential for enormous changes in the Arctic landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dynamics of thermokarst are of particular interest to Arctic scientists. Wayne Pollard of McGill is a 25-year veteran of high Arctic permafrost research. He has been coming here to study the various thaw processes that give rise to the area's unique landforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Most importantly under today's climate,'' he says, ''are the potential impacts of global warming on permafrost temperature and distribution, which would affect surface erosion and vegetation through runoff and thaw.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Pollard has been studying a particular kind of thermokarst landform known as a thaw slump -- a vertical exposure of massive buried ice that begins to melt more and more of the ground when exposed to summer air temperatures. These visually impressive features resemble large mudslides eating their way across the surface of the polar desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they are a natural part of the landscape's evolution, it is the current change in their frequency and distribution that may signify the effects of a warming climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summer of 2012 was one of the hottest on record for the Canadian high Arctic, with an average high in July of 54 degrees Fahrenheit and some days approaching 70. The relatively sweltering heat under the 24-hour sun caused hordes of mosquitoes to erupt, driving the resident wildlife and us nearly insane with their attacks. During that trip north, Dr. Pollard noted not just that there was a 30 percent increase in the number of thaw slumps, but that they were also causing the highest amount of erosion ever observed for this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The broader scientific community supports the idea that extreme summers like 2012 are a sign of increased global warming in polar regions,'' he said. ''One year on its own can be a simple anomaly; however, several summers within a fixed time period, about 10 years, is more likely part of a longer-term trend.'' And whether this trend is part of a natural cycle of warming or linked to human factors, he continued, ''is still difficult to resolve.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the region is still developing, in geologic terms: Areas of lower elevation are relatively young, having risen from the sea as little as 1,000 years ago. Teasing out the effects of climate&nbsp;change, as opposed to natural landscape processes, requires careful analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to do this is to examine parallel lines of climate research to see if the trend is detected elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On neighboring Axel Heiberg Island, glaciologists Miles Ecclestone of Trent University and Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa are measuring how much mass the glaciers are losing. One hunk of ice in particular, the White Glacier, has one of the longest monitoring program of any glacier in the Canadian Arctic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The mass balance and ice core records tell us that recent climate patterns are unusually warm, particularly since the mid-1990s,'' Dr. Copeland says. ''For the White Glacier, these past two decades of annual mass balance measurement have been overwhelmingly negative; indeed, most glacier mass balances are becoming increasingly negative'' -- the greatest losses, he added, since records began in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that hot summers are becoming more frequent -- an ominous sign for polar desert ecosystems that rely on stable ground ice. In addition to the catastrophic collapses of thaw slumps, melting ice causes depressions in the ground that collect snow and water runoff that give rise to meadow and wetland communities in place of desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already there are signs of greening in the high Arctic. And simulated warming sites across the region predict a broad array of changes in plant communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effects of warming don't stop at the green stuff. Changes in a plant community cascade up the food web to the grazing musk oxen, hares and other herbivores that live in the desert. And while a greener Arctic with more vegetation sounds like a boon to the animals that eat the plants, the end results are not so simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, any beneficial effects of a warmer climate on herbivores' food sources could be offset by rising humidity. That, in turn, means more snowfall, which blankets the plants that the musk ox, the largest Arctic herbivore, needs to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niels Martin Schmidt is the scientific leader of Zackenberg Research Station in northeastern Greenland, a latitude similar to the Canadian high Arctic. He has been studying the plant-herbivore interactions of musk oxen in Greenland and finding that changing winter conditions regulate their populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, after snow-rich winters, the musk oxen have a much harder time getting to their food source and surviving these harsh conditions, and an increase in starved carcasses are found across the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the duration of winter declines, Dr. Schmidt says, the population of musk oxen may gain in the short term. But ''in the long run, higher temperatures will lead to fewer musk oxen, because of more unstable winter conditions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high Arctic is changing. The interactions among all the elements of the region are complex, especially given the added influence of human-driven climate&nbsp;change. And that's the particular threat of climate&nbsp;change: When we disturb one aspect of the system, we affect all the other parts that rely on it, with unforeseen consequences for the Arctic and the entire planet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two dozen scientists, authors, and world and national figures answered two questions: What is your greatest worry about climate&nbsp;change? What gives you hope? Here are some of their answers, condensed for space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANE LUBCHENCO, Former administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I worry about oceans becoming more corrosive, decimating both fisheries and coral reefs. Oceans have already become 30 percent more acidic since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution; if business-as-usual carbon emissions continue, oceans are likely to be 150 percent more acidic by the end of this century. Yikes!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I take heart in knowing that social change can happen very rapidly once a tipping point is reached, that young people are bringing new passion and creativity to the issue, and that climate&nbsp;change is being seen increasingly as the moral issue it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TENZIN GYATSO, 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst possible aspect of climate&nbsp;change is that it will be irreversible and irrevocable. Therefore, there is the urgency to do whatever we can to protect the environment while we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was young, even I did not really think about the environment, nor did I hear much about it from others. Today, more and more people are trying to take action. We are beginning to look at this planet as our only home, and I am hopeful that this will lead to the generation of a genuine sense of universal responsibility. We can do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG, Former mayor of New York City and special United Nations envoy for cities and climate&nbsp;change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something like 90 percent of the world's cities are on coasts, and in most places, the most vulnerable people in those cities will feel the worst impacts. We have a responsibility to do something about that. We can't afford to sit back, cross our fingers and hope for the best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tremendous amount of progress is being made by cities all around the world. Cities account for some 70 percent of the emissions that cause climate&nbsp;change, so together they can make a big difference. In New York City back in 2007, we set a goal of reducing our carbon footprint 30 percent by 2030, and we got to a 19 percent reduction in just six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayors have powers they can use to address climate&nbsp;change immediately. They have control over many of the things that create emissions -- like transportation and buildings -- and they can invest in infrastructure. They're not interested in turning the issue into a big political fight. They're the ones most directly responsible for people's safety and welfare -- and they recognize the dangers of inaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JEFFREY SACHS, Director, Earth Institute of Columbia University</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil industry has lobbied Washington to a state of paralysis, and as is so often true, greed is at the root of the crisis, with the politicians getting in line to feed at the oil trough. The climate deniers are not the real problem. Their transparent propaganda and misdirections are laughable; their scientific ignorance is impossible to miss. The real problem is the cowardice and greed of those who absolutely know better, both in government and industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are living in an age of technological breakthroughs that could transform the world economy to a low-carbon energy system by midcentury. Solar, wind, geothermal, carbon sequestration, safe nuclear energy, and energy efficiency are all part of the mix. The oil industry should cooperate, rather than faking it or dodging it as until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARBARA KINGSOLVER, Novelist; author of the memoir ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fear: Catastrophic extinction. We don't get to make natural laws. Natural law made us, and it ultimately will unmake us. What makes me very sad is that we're going to take so many species down with us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My hope: We in the United States finally seem to be coming to the table after decades of either denial or argument. It seems as if denial as a political strategy has run its course and that we are stepping up to our responsibilities. I hope that's true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALAN I. LESHNER, Chief executive, American Association for the Advancement of Science</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideology and intuition sometimes appear to be trumping science. So people deny the evidence even as it increases. I fear that the pace at which the public understands that the climate is changing, and puts pressure on the political system, will be too slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are seeing that communicating scientific knowledge has had an effect, and that makes me happy! The deniers have less and less credibility as the public understands the scientific consensus more and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON, Director, Hayden Planetarium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find that to worry about things is to invest emotional energy in ways that do not lead to change. Always better to do something about a problem than to worry about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I expect will happen in the coming decades is that beachfront real estate, some of the most expensive in the housing marketplace, will become overrun by storm surges with enough frequency that it will force the wealthiest class (who might have previously been in denial of the phenomenon) to recognize the problem and take action, actions they can take since they are typically captains of industry and are in power and in control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERRY BROWN, Governor of California</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A huge challenge of climate&nbsp;change lies in the fact that for its solution, countries all over the world must collaborate in ways that are entirely unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each nation-state has to be fully engaged and take decisive steps outside the conventional economic comfort zone. And that requires more statesmanship that is currently in evidence in any of those countries. The mythology of the market and economistic view of life has to be transcended so people understand that a decent and sustainable quality of life requires a very different philosophy than the one that governs contemporary societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in California, we're leading the nation in the economic recovery and the creation of jobs, and we are pioneering climate&nbsp;change strategies across a broad front. We have a robust cap-and-trade system. We have a goal of one-third renewable energy in the electricity sector; we're already at 22 percent. We have the strictest building standards in the world. We have a goal of over a million electric vehicles; we've got our first 100,000! We have a certain momentum in California. There are other states where this is also true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAMES E. HANSEN, Climate scientist, emeritus director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason it's a really dangerous situation is that the climate system does not respond quickly to the forces we apply to it. That means that we have not witnessed the impact of the gases we've already added to the atmosphere. We're waiting for the public to see enough to demand effective government response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public doesn't see that much yet, but there's more in the pipeline. We are pumping energy into the ocean at a rapid rate; that energy is accumulating, and its biggest impact is going to be on ice shelves. The sea level will go up many meters. That means all coastal cities will be doomed if we stay on fossil fuel business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upside is that the only policy that will work is making the price of fossil fuels match their cost. We have an organization determined to focus on exactly that issue: the Citizens Climate Lobby. It's growing rapidly. Things are changing. But not fast enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARIO J. MOLINA, Co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize for his research on the chemistry of the ozone layer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What worries me most is the irrationality of certain interest groups preventing society from addressing the problem. Republicans in Congress are preventing action on an efficient solution such as a carbon tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a solution at hand. It doesn't cost as much as the deniers claim. The Montreal Protocol [on ozone depletion] showed that you could solve such global problems. It would have been much more expensive not to solve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Author of ''The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last 10,000 years or so, the climate's been relatively stable. But if you start imagining a world with a constantly changing climate, one where, say, rainfall patterns shift dramatically every few decades, then you begin to realize how dependent we all are on that stability. And the world we're creating is that constantly changing one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I worry about just about everything, starting with the basics. There are 7.2 billion people on the planet right now, and we all need to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefulness or a lack of it is really not the issue here. We've already caused a lot of damage; there's a lot of warming that's in effect baked into the system. We're capable of causing a great deal more damage, and we're also capable of limiting that damage. That's the choice at this point, and we need to face up to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. MARSHALL SHEPHERD, Former president, American Meteorological Society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It bothers me that people think there's a big debate in science when there isn't. Being concerned about climate&nbsp;change is not some whim. When I go to the mall or to Walmart, people ask, ''Do you really believe in climate&nbsp;change?'' That's like asking, ''Do you believe in gravity?'' I mean, the science is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gives me optimism is that many of the people who question the science are of an older generation. The kids get it. When I go to my children's Scout meetings or when I talk to students on campus, they get beyond the misinformation and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REV. MITCHELL C. HESCOX, President, Evangelical Environmental Network</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is the greatest moral challenge of our time because it impacts every single soul in the world. In the conservative Christian world in the United States, we've gotten caught up in political partisanship. I'd like to see climate&nbsp;change as a Christian issue and not a partisan issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are the stewards of God's creation. We believe that the earth's creation belongs to God and that we are charged to care for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we started this [network] five years ago, we had 15,000 people we regularly communicated with on this issue. Today it approaches 400,000. It means that we're starting to overcome the partisan divide and the tide is slowly turning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DIANA H. WALL, Director, School of Global Environmental Sustainability, Colorado State University</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What keeps me up, the thing that really drives me nuts, is that the rate of change is so fast. I work in one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth: the Antarctic Dry Valleys. It is the coldest, windiest, driest place on Earth. We're seeing warming events and very sunny events there, and this is causing a change in the organisms I study. These species have adapted to the conditions there. We don't know what the impact will be on them or us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My students give me hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARTIN REES, Astrophysicist, University of Cambridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a lot more fears than hopes. One aspect that particularly troubles me is that economists tend to underprioritize efforts at mitigation of atmospheric carbon, because the really serious downside of inaction won't be experienced until the 22nd century and beyond. If action is delayed, it may then be too late to avoid irreversible runaway changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We shouldn't discriminate against our fellow humans on grounds of date of birth. The lifetime welfare of the newborn should rate as highly as that of the already middle-aged. Indeed, many philosophers would assign equal value to the rights of those not yet born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them, foreclosing the potentialities of all future generations would be so catastrophic that we should strive to reduce even the tiniest probability that this could happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, Former governor of New Jersey and former administrator, Environmental Protection Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What keeps me up at night are people who talk in absolutes. It's the people who say ''humans cause it'' or ''people have no role in it,'' full stop. Science is not exact and the truth is in between. By taking the extreme position, they give an opening to the other side, and then people stop listening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gives me hope is that there are signs that the American people are beginning to relate some of the frequent weather extremes to climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1980 our economy has grown, our population has grown and our energy use has grown, and yet our overall pollution has gone down. We are perfectly capable of implementing environmental regulation without stopping economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KATHARINE HAYHOE, Director, Climate Science Center, Texas Tech University</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What troubles me as a scientist is the potential for vicious feedbacks within the climate system. The warming that we cause through all the carbon we produce could cause a series of cascading impacts that could lead to a much greater warming. The more carbon we produce, the higher the likelihood of these unpredictable risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes me hopeful are people. I've been working with cities, states and regional transportation councils, and none of them have to be convinced of the reality of this problem. I was sitting next to an assistant city manager for Dallas, a town not known for being green, and she blew me away with her list of amazing things Dallas has done to save energy. People are preparing for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARGARET ATWOOD, Poet and novelist, author of ''The Year of the Flood''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most worrisome thing is the potential death of the ocean. If it dies, we die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gives me hope is that more and more people are aware of the dangers we face, and many smart people are at work on solutions. Our smart brains got us into this. Let's see if they can get us out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREEMAN J. DYSON, Theoretical physicist, Institute for Advanced Study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What worries me is that many people, including scientists and politicians, believe a whole lot of dogmatic nonsense about climate&nbsp;change. The nonsense says that climate&nbsp;change is a terrible danger and that it is something we could do something about if we wanted to. The whole point is to scare people, and this has been done very successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate has always been changing, and climate has always been lousy. It has always been a background to existence that on the whole we've learned to cope with pretty well. What I feel happy about is that there are a lot of ordinary people with common sense who don't believe the nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARLENE MOSES, Nauru's ambassador to the United Nations, chairwoman of the Alliance of Small Island States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I go home and look at the deteriorating situation there -- increased droughts, the ocean washing away the coast -- I can't help but be fearful for what the future may hold for Nauru's children and grandchildren. How will they adapt? Will the international community be there for them? These are most distressing questions to which I don't yet have answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GLORIA STEINEM, Co-founder and former editor, Ms. Magazine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thinking about climate&nbsp;change used to give me images of the sun burning down and icebergs melting -- horrific, but also impersonal and far away. Now I have intimate fears of storms and floods that drive us off this island of Manhattan, and fires that send thousands fleeing -- in other words, just an acceleration of what we're already seeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like millions of others in public opinion polls, I'm willing to lower my standard of living to help create a turning point. We're waiting for a practical, coordinated, understandable set of instructions that counters the Kochs, the deniers, the profiteers. Meanwhile, we try to do whatever we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow, I find comfort in the idea that the earth is a living organism with a will of its own. The global women's movement gives me hope because women are trying to take control of their own bodies and reproduction, which is even more basic than production. Everything we know says that when women can decide whether and when to have children, growth slows down to a little over replacement level. And that would be the single biggest long-term relief for the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARY ROBINSON, Former president of Ireland, former United Nations High Commissioner for human rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a grandmother with five grandchildren. What will they say about what we did or didn't do?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ULAN BATOR, Mongolia -- For all of his victories and skills, Genghis Khan always insisted that the god Tengri -- the Eternal Blue Sky -- deserved the credit for his triumphant success in uniting the vast Mongol Empire in the early 13th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 21st-century science may be proving him right. Not long ago, researchers studying ancient tree rings found evidence that the Great Khan rose to power during an exceptionally mild 15-year stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back-to-back years of plentiful rain and favorable temperatures -- known as pluvials, the opposite of droughts -- promoted vegetation growth, the researchers believe, and that in turn supported the livestock needed to power an army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Mongol Empire pluvial was quite exceptional in its duration,'' said Neil Pederson, an ecologist at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts. ''It was the only one in the past 1,000 years that lasted more than 10 years, so it's really a singular event.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, Mongolia's climatic tides have been shifting toward another extreme. A 10-year drought and heat wave from 2000 to 2010, according to the tree ring data, was the most severe the country had had in a millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm more and more convinced that the only way we can understand this 21st-century event is within the context of climate&nbsp;change,'' said Amy Hessl, a geographer at West Virginia University. ''And the human side of that -- combined with a constellation of other factors -- is going to be incredible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mongolia is largely herders, not warriors. Sandwiched between Russia and China, it has almost three million people in a vast tract of desert and rolling steppe grassland, punctuated by mountains and forests. Climate continues to significantly shape the lives of Genghis Khan's descendants, around one-third of whom still practice the seminomadic herding of their ancestors, moving their house -- traditionally, a dome-shaped tent called a ger -- with the seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While televisions and solar panels are a common sight in modern gers, herders still rely on thousands of years of collective knowledge to thrive in the harsh Mongolian environment, where the temperature regularly dips below minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit in winter. Yet the predictable ebb and flow of warmth and cold, rain and snow, has begun to falter in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't know why the weather has become unusual, but I'm very worried about it,'' said Urgamaltsetsg Suvita, 47, a herder in the Gobi Desert. Summer is hotter and drier and plagued by sandstorms, she said, and winter brings too much snow or too little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, an extreme snowstorm killed her flock of livestock -- nearly 1,000 animals, including horses, sheep and goats. ''Winter is no longer winter,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much of the world, Mongolia is already experiencing the effects of climate&nbsp;change. The country's average annual temperature has risen more than 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit since 1940; paradoxically, winter months have grown colder over the past 20 years. Streams and lakes have begun to dry up, and fires frequently blaze across millions of acres of steppe and forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The steppe ecosystem is burning and burning and burning,'' said Oyunsanaa Byambasuren, a lecturer in forestry at the National University of Mongolia. ''But we really don't have enough specialists or professionals dealing with those issues.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dzuds -- extreme winter events that cause mass livestock die-offs -- also seem to be increasing in frequency and intensity. From 1999 to 2002, a succession of winter dzuds followed by summer droughts killed 30 percent of all livestock in Mongolia, and a 2010 dzud claimed 8.8 million livestock -- losses equivalent to 4.4 percent of the country's economic output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Wealth in much of Mongolia is measured in animals,'' said Nicole Davi, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and at William Paterson University. ''If you lose all of your animals, you lose everything.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayush Ish, 69, has lived in the Gobi Desert all her life. She and her husband lost their flock of goats and sheep in the 2002 dzud and drought, then slowly rebuilt it with the help of 50 animals allocated by the government. But when the 2010 dzud struck, all but 20 died. Around the same time, her husband died as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't know if it will happen again,'' she said, tears running down her cheeks. ''I can only hope that we're entering a good period now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many rural Mongolians who follow a shamanistic belief system, Ms. Ish says that mining -- which has recently become widespread around the country -- is to blame for the changing weather patterns. Troy Sternberg, a geographer at the University of Oxford, said that ''under the Mongolian belief system, the earth and sky are connected, so if you take gold out of the ground, you're disrupting the natural rhythms of weather and climate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not that is true, the rise of mining -- along with overgrazing by herders chasing the cashmere market -- has led to wide desertification. Some studies indicate that 70 percent of Mongolia's grasslands are degraded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, these patterns bode ominously for the herders' way of life. A team of Mongolian and international experts warned in a 2009 report that such trends ''may lead to the end of the Mongolian traditional way of animal husbandry as we know it, that at onetime was the very core of the entire nomadic civilization.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some herders have already reached that breaking point. After the 1999 to 2002 dzuds alone, 180,000 people moved to the capital, Ulan Bator, in search of a better life. ''The movement from a rural, agrarian life to an urban industrial one is not necessarily a bad thing if people are interested in doing other things that are tied to a more diverse economy,'' said Maria Fernandez-Gimenez, an ecologist at Colorado State University. ''But opportunities and services have to exist to enable that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who reach the capital usually settle in the ger district, a sprawling, makeshift neighborhood that encircles the city and creeps into the surrounding valleys. Although the skyscrapers of downtown are in eyesight, basic services are luxuries. Families must trek up to a mile to collect water from communal wells, and in winter, they burn coal and garbage to keep warm, helping to make Ulan Bator one of the world's most polluted cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khishigee Shuurai, 36, moved from western Mongolia to the capital around 15 years ago. In 2002, after losing their flock, her parents joined her in the city. Then her father died of a heart attack. Before that, she said, he frequently expressed a longing to return to the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many, however, life here is preferable to the uncertainty and harshness of nomadic herding. Ms. Shuurai, a school custodian and mother of four, does not share her father's regrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her husband, a construction worker, have jobs, and they recently got electricity in their ger. Her 7-year-old daughter was honored as the top student in her class, and her 12-year-old son wants to become an engineer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's many reasons to stay,'' she said. ''I don't want to go back.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walruses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea ice is critical for all parts of the walrus's life cycle. Adults dive and eat on these frigid platforms, and females give birth and raise their pups there. But as sea ice retreats during Arctic summers, walruses are being driven ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arctic is changing -- fast. Two experts who have spent decades working there believe that the marine mammals who call the high latitudes home are now locked into a human-forced ecological game of chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the summer we've seen the sea ice recede far to the north,'' said Chadwick V. Jay, a research ecologist for the United States Geological Survey. That change is ''making it very difficult for walruses to make a living.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In five of the last seven summers, tens of thousands of female Pacific walruses and their pups have come ashore in Alaska, farther from their preferred prey: the clam, worm and snail beds in the deep waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In China, the tea harvest depends on the monsoons: The best tea is harvested in springtime, when the weather is still dry. But climate&nbsp;change threatens to extend the monsoon season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Post monsoon season, farmers get much less from their harvest, and a lot of the chemicals that give tea its flavor drop,'' said Colin M. Orians, a chemical ecologist at Tufts University. ''If climate&nbsp;changes the onset of the monsoon season, farmers will have a shorter window in which to harvest their tea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next four years, Dr. Orians and his team will investigate the effects of changing temperatures and rainfall on tea quality and on the livelihoods of farmers who depend on the harvest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salamanders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salamanders in the Appalachian Mountains are getting smaller, and species at lower altitudes, where the greatest drying and warming has occurred, are the most affected. One species became 18 percent smaller over 55 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It could be that a change in body size is the first response to climate&nbsp;change,'' said Karen Lips, an ecologist at the University of Maryland. ''Their food may be affected, and they may be producing smaller babies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Lips partially relied on the data of Richard Highton, a retired ecologist from the University of Maryland who spent 50 years studying and collecting salamanders that are now preserved at the Smithsonian Institution. At the time of his retirement, he noted that salamanders were mysteriously disappearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If they are not nearly as big, they may not be producing as many offspring,'' Dr. Lips said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To test the theory, Dr. Lips and her team plan to raise salamanders in incubators that mimic different climates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bumblebees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bumblebees and other pollinators are critical to global agriculture, but recent studies suggest that up to one-quarter of Europe's bumblebee population may die out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers say that climate&nbsp;change is at least partly to blame, along with disease and loss of habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists estimate that pollinators indirectly contribute about $30 billion a year to the European economy. ''Pollinators are essential to our population,'' said Jean-Christophe Vi&Atilde;&copy;, deputy director of the species program at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roe Deer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roe deer, a small, reddish-brown species that flourishes all over Europe, give birth when new plant growth provides ample nutritious food for the mother. But flowers are blooming earlier than they used to, and the deer are missing their meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers tracked deer births from 1985 to 2011 in the Champagne region of northeastern France, where average spring temperatures have steadily increased and flowering time is coming gradually earlier. The study is online in PLOS Biology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deer time their fertility by light availability, not temperature. With earlier springs, they are now giving birth too late to take advantage of the best food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using data on 1,095 births, the scientists calculated that the mismatch between flowering time and birth over the period had grown by 36 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers estimate that deer fitness declined by 6 percent over the period, and by 14 percent in 2007 and 2011, when flowering was particularly early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Roe deer are very dependent on large quantities of high quality food, and the critical stage is the first week's supply,'' said the lead author, Jean-Michel Gaillard, a director of research at the National Center for Scientific Research at the University of Lyon. ''Unlike birds, for example, that can migrate and breed earlier, roe deer cannot.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Mediterranean Basin, small olive farms can support entire families. Olive trees are notoriously drought-resistant, and even in arid ecosystems they attract migratory birds and a host of insect species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the region warms, some olive trees will not be as productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the south, you're going to see a lower crop yield,'' said Andrew Paul Gutierrez, an ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''In marginal areas, the farmers will just go out of business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gutierrez and his colleagues predict that some local farmers ultimately will have to abandon their orchards, leaving barren swaths of desert where biodiversity once flourished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lemmings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to myth, lemmings do not commit mass suicide. But populations do rise and fall in predictable cycles, to the benefit and detriment of predators like arctic foxes and migratory birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, scientists noticed that some groups of lemmings have died off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The lemming cycle is the heartbeat of the terrestrial Arctic,'' said Nicolas Lecomte, a biologist at the University of Moncton in Canada. ''Now we're seeing the collapse of the main prey of many terrestrial predators.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lemmings survive harsh winters by hiding in the snow. When warmer temperatures bring off-season rain, that snow turns to ice, and the lemmings cannot burrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Lecomte has found that as lemmings die off en masse, the fragile Arctic ecosystem is growing weaker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wheat, Rice and Corn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If wheat, rice and corn are going to continue to feed the world, the crops will have to adapt to warmer temperatures. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change offers some predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis, published last spring in Nature Climate&nbsp;Change, concluded that a 3.6 degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature will bring a significant decline in crop yields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most projections see a decrease from 2030 onward, with greater decreases in the 2040s and 2050s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selective breeding and changes in irrigation methods, pest control, fertilization and planting dates may compensate, partially, for the temperature change. But most of these adaptations will work better in temperate regions, while tropical crop yields will continue to decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme weather events -- another consequence of climate&nbsp;change -- will affect yields year-to-year in ways that are difficult to forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are two pieces of bad news here,'' said the lead author of the I.P.C.C report, Andy J. Challinor, a professor of climate impact at the University of Leeds in England. ''One is that average yields are going down. The other is that yields in any given year will be less reliable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NICHOLAS BAKALAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharks pursue their prey partly by odor, but rising carbon dioxide levels may severely impair their sense of smell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists used the smooth dogfish, a small shark, as an experimental animal. They created tanks in which some jets of water held the odor of squid, a favorite food, or no odor at all. The water in the tanks also contained varying levels of carbon dioxide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With carbon dioxide levels resembling today's, the sharks spent 60 percent of their time nosing about the plume with the squid odor. But in water with carbon dioxide concentrations predicted for the year 2100, the animals actively avoided the jet with the food odor, spending only 15 percent of their time there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any change in shark feeding habits might affect other species as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There might be a decrease in hunting behavior among sharks, and an increase in prey animals as a result,'' said a co-author, Ashley R. Jennings, a researcher at Boston University. ''That's assuming the prey animals aren't being affected by CO&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8218;&#8218;</SPAN> as well.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NICHOLAS BAKALAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conch Snails</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the oceans gather carbon, a small sea snail that lives in the Great Barrier Reef risks losing its famous ability to leap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conch snail jumps to escape from a predator, also a sea snail, that tries to inject it with a poisonous dart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In laboratory experiments in water with increased carbon dioxide levels, the snails were 50 percent less likely to jump. And snails that did jump took nearly twice as long to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carbon dioxide and acidity disrupt a neurotransmitter receptor in the snail's nervous system, one that other marine animals also rely on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are very widespread,'' said Sue-Ann Watson, a biologist at James Cook University in Australia. ''It could affect many marine animals and their behaviors.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oceans today are 30 percent more acidic than they were 250 years ago, when the Industrial Revolution started. And it is getting worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''By the end of the century, if we carry on with business as usual, they will be 150 percent more acidic than they were 250 years ago,'' Dr. Watson said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By MICHAEL WINES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 17</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">707 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new and most likely controversial analysis of Pacific Ocean weather patterns concludes that a century-long trend of rising temperatures in the American Northwest is largely explained by natural shifts in ocean winds, not by human activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis, published on Monday in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, effectively suggests that the region has warmed because ocean winds, on average, have weakened and shifted direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists have long known that sea surface temperatures are lower when strong winds whip up ocean waves, and higher when the seas are calm. Researchers generally have assumed that the phenomenon was but one factor in that warming, and that increased levels of carbon dioxide from human activity play a major role in driving rising temperatures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new analysis, which relies on wind, barometric pressure and temperature data recorded from 1900 to 2012, concludes that human activity has little impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The concept of winds controlling or affecting ocean temperature in that very way is not controversial, but the strength of that relationship was quite amazing'' in the northwestern Pacific, said James Johnstone, a climatologist and the study's lead author. ''It explains practically every wiggle in the ocean temperature variations. It's a phenomenal correlation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the analysis plays down the impact of human activity on the region's temperatures, its findings are not a judgment on the origins of climate&nbsp;change everywhere, the authors emphasized. Indeed, they said, the characteristics of the region studied -- an area of the Pacific from Alaska to Hawaii to California -- may conspire to make wind the determining factor in air temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind changes were shown to influence land temperatures in the area of the study, from Northern California to Oregon and Washington, but the effect diminished with the distance from the ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article appears as heads of state are gathered at the United Nations for a climate summit meeting emphasizing the human role in global warming. Dr Johnstone said the timing was coincidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Look at a map of the world's hot spots for wind variations, and the North Pacific shows up as a pretty special place, one of those hot spots,'' said the study's co-author, Nathan J. Mantua, a research scientist at the federal government's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz, Calif. Not only are the region's winds highly variable, he said, but they also influence other factors, including ocean currents, that affect temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ocean surface temperatures in the northeast Pacific and the Northwest coast have risen between one-half and one degree Celsius since about 1900. That slow rise unfolded amid temperature shifts caused by climate cycles like the warm-water Ni&ntilde;o and the larger, longer Pacific Decadal Oscillation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study concludes that cycles like those play out over far longer periods, and that the current warming appears to be part of one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 80 percent of the temperature increases in the ocean and coastal areas was attributed to a weakening of the North Pacific high, a high-pressure zone that dominates northeast Pacific weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists' ocean measures were gathered from measurements of temperature, pressure and wind made independently by ships and, later, more advanced weather monitoring devices. While the measurements varied day to day, broader changes in barometric pressure were followed in lock step, about four months later, by changes in temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study cast doubt on the possibility that the wind changes were themselves caused by rising carbon-dioxide levels, noting that simulations employing the latest climate-change computer models found no such link, and that temperatures rose most sharply when carbon dioxide levels were lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One renowned climate scientist who had not seen the study, Kerry A. Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said its findings were not inconsistent with what experts know about climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The common misperception about global warming is that it's globally uniform,'' he said. ''It isn't. There are even a few places over a couple hundred years that have actually cooled, such as the Southeastern U.S.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 climate&nbsp;change protesters were arrested on Monday as hundreds marched through the streets of Lower Manhattan, at one point clashing with the police as they tried to push through barricades sealing off Wall Street.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those protesters, some linking arms, had marched two blocks north on Broadway from Bowling Green just after 3:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wall Street the group turned right, and some marchers began dismantling metal barricades that separated the street and the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers rushed to replace the barricades, and the marchers surged forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next 15 minutes a furious shoving match took place as protesters tried to push the barricades over and the police pushed the barricades back into the marchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few officers punched the hands of marchers gripping the barricades. Then, a burst of pepper spray sent many of the demonstrators reeling backward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police said three protesters had been arrested by 7 p.m. The bulk of the arrests took place over the next couple of hours, as several dozen protesters ignored orders to disperse and sat in the middle of Broadway. Officers surrounded them as others on the sidewalk chanted, ''We believe that we will win.'' Then officers began arresting those in the street and leading them away. There were no reports of injuries, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants had begun marching late Monday morning from Battery Park to Wall Street to protest the role they say investments in companies with practices that damage the environment play in encouraging climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Streaming out of the park, protesters made a sharp turn onto Broadway, and marched north between idling buses and trucks, chanting, ''The people are rising, no more compromising.'' They stopped just north of Bowling Green, blocking Broadway up to Morris Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, they sat down, unfurled a huge banner denouncing capitalism and held a series of meetings as marching bands played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those blocking Broadway was Gabriele Romeri from Ossining, N.Y., who said she thought that moneyed interests were creating energy policies at the expense of the public good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think that it is important for the sake of democracy that the people stand up,'' she said. ''Business is basically running the government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the demonstrators dressed in blue to symbolize a wave of water -- water that could engulf the low-lying streets near the New York Stock Exchange, as the storm surge from the East River and New York Harbor did during Hurricane Sandy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event, called Flood Wall Street, was planned over months as a sharper and more rebellious corollary to the large-scale climate&nbsp;change march that organizers said drew more than 300,000 people to Midtown on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities on Monday were organized without official permission from the city, and many people taking part said they were willing to be arrested to show their conviction that the economic system encourages investment that is damaging to the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was Yates McKee, an art critic from Inwood in Upper Manhattan. ''We're highlighting capitalism as the target,'' Mr. McKee said. ''Capitalism equals climate chaos.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the protesters took to the roadways on Monday, blocking vehicles while chanting, dancing and holding meetings, the police appeared to take a restrained role, containing the roving group instead of confronting it directly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaskans, stay in Alaska. People in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest, sit tight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists trying to predict the consequences of climate&nbsp;change say that they see few safe havens from the storms, floods and droughts that are sure to intensify over the coming decades. But some regions, they add, will fare much better than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget most of California and the Southwest (drought, wildfires). Ditto for much of the East Coast and Southeast (heat waves, hurricanes, rising sea levels). Washington, D.C., for example, may well be a flood zone by 2100, according to an estimate released last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, consider Anchorage. Or even, perhaps, Detroit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you do not like it hot and do not want to be hit by a hurricane, the options of where to go are very limited,'' said Camilo Mora, a geography professor at the University of Hawaii and lead author of a paper published in Nature last year predicting that unprecedented high temperatures will become the norm worldwide by 2047.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The best place really is Alaska,'' he added. ''Alaska is going to be the next Florida by the end of the century.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under any model of climate&nbsp;change, scientists say, most of the country will look and feel drastically different in 2050, 2100 and beyond, even as cities and states try to adapt and plan ahead. The northern Great Plains states may well be pleasant (if muggy) for future generations, as may many neighboring states. Although few people today are moving long distances to strategize for climate&nbsp;change, some are at least pondering the question of where they would go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The answer is the Pacific Northwest, and probably especially west of the Cascades,'' said Ben Strauss, vice president for climate impacts and director of the program on sea level rise at Climate Central, a research collaboration of scientists and journalists. ''Actually, the strip of coastal land running from Canada down to the Bay Area is probably the best,'' he added. ''You see a lot less extreme heat; it's the one place in the West where there's no real expectation of major water stress, and while sea level will rise there as everywhere, the land rises steeply out of the ocean, so it's a relatively small factor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clifford E. Mass, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington, writes a popular weather blog in which he predicts that the Pacific Northwest will be ''a potential climate refuge'' as global warming progresses. A Seattle resident, he foresees that ''climate&nbsp;change migrants'' will start heading to his city and to Portland, Ore., and surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Pacific Ocean is like our natural air conditioning,'' Professor Mass said in a telephone interview. ''We don't get humidity like the East Coast does.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the water supply? ''Water is important, and we will have it,'' Professor Mass declared. ''All in all, it's a pretty benign situation for us -- in fact, warming up just a little bit might be a little bit welcome around here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, he said, Washington State is gearing up to become the next Napa Valley as California's wine country heats up and dries out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are going crazy putting in vineyards in eastern Washington right now,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be other refuges to the east. Don't count out the elevated inland cities in the country's midsection, like Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Milwaukee and Detroit, said Matthew E. Kahn, a professor of environmental economics at the University of California, Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I predict we're going to have millions of people moving to those areas,'' he said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 2010 book ''Climatopolis,'' Professor Kahn predicts that when things get bad enough in any given location -- not just the temperatures and extreme weather, but also the cost of insurance and so forth -- people will become ''environmental refugees,'' fleeing cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Diego. By 2100, he writes, Detroit will be one of the nation's most desirable cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That assertion came as a surprise to Rachel Burnside-Saltmarshall, a former president of the Detroit Association of Realtors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I haven't come across that,'' Ms. Burnside-Saltmarshall said diplomatically, adding that there were more immediate municipal concerns. ''Like crime -- tell me when that's going to go down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by United Van Lines looking at relocation trends in 2013 found that its customers were moving primarily for economic reasons -- a new job, lower costs of living -- or quality-of-life considerations that were not climate related, such as public transit or green space. Coincidentally, Oregon -- a predicted climate-change winner -- topped the list of inbound moves, followed by South Carolina, North Carolina, the District of Columbia and South Dakota. The top states for outbound moves were New Jersey, Illinois, New York, West Virginia and Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What we see is that people are actually moving into harm's way,'' said Thomas C. Peterson, principal scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center. ''They're moving from relatively safe places in the Midwest to places along the Florida coast, where the risk has been increasing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Miami was named one of the nation's most vulnerable cities in the National Climate Assessment, the third in a series of federal reports on how global warming will play out across the country. The week the report was released, Miami Beach residents were wading through ankle-deep waters on some of their main thoroughfares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As sea levels rise in the decades ahead, said Professor Mass of the University of Washington, ''if there's ground zero for where you don't want to be, Florida is it.'' Other particularly vulnerable places are the low-lying cities of the East and Gulf Coasts, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for New York City, the nation's most populous city, Professor Mora at the University of Hawaii projects that 2047 will be the ''year of climate&nbsp;change departure'' -- when weather that seems extraordinarily hot and catastrophic by today's standards will become the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The coasts are all going to be facing very hot temperatures,'' Professor Mora said. Washington, D.C., will reach its tipping point the same year, under his model; Los Angeles has until 2048; San Francisco, 2049 and Chicago, 2052. Detroit has until 2051, and Anchorage, 2071.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some climate experts are optimistic that major cities will plan, adapt and ward off catastrophe. ''New York has such a concentration of wealth and assets that I expect we will invest to defend the region from sea level rise and flooding, and there's already movement in that direction,'' said Mr. Strauss of Climate Central, a New York City resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in the places that are expected to come out ahead, the picture does not look entirely rosy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Summer in Minnesota is projected to be like the climate is in northern Oklahoma -- the trees and the forests there, the crops that farmers plant,'' said Dr. Peterson of NOAA, citing the 2009 National Climate Assessment. ''You build houses differently in Minnesota versus Oklahoma, you lay railroad tracks differently.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, Dr. Peterson said, the changes will be highly disruptive, particularly over time. ''We often talk about the climate from now 'til the end of this century, because that's kind of a nice model,'' he said, ''But it's not going to end there -- it's going to keep changing.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEMPE, Ariz. -- Even the microbes, it seems, may be on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the planet warms, scientists say, the range of many plants and animals will change, shifting to cooler climes closer to the poles or at higher elevations. Such changes have already been documented for hundreds of species, including American goldfinches, brown argus butterflies and red oaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ferran Garcia-Pichel, a microbiologist at Arizona State University, has found evidence that this type of climate&nbsp;change impact may occur even among the smallest organisms. Photosynthesizing microbes that colonize arid soils will shift across the Southwest, with more heat-tolerant species moving northward and upward as temperatures increase.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one is certain what the effects will be, because little is known about the more heat-tolerant species. But the impact could be profound, given that the microbes, called cyanobacteria, play a critical role in desert and scrub environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A change in microbes might affect soil fertility, which could reduce the quality of scrubland that is used for cattle grazing. It could affect how the little water that falls in such areas is absorbed. And it could make arid lands more vulnerable to erosion and contribute to dust storms, already a problem in the Southwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyanobacteria ''are an important part of the ecosystem,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The microbes are contained in what are called biological soil crusts, the top few inches of soil in arid and semiarid lands found between clumps of vegetation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Soil crusts are found in every desert, and in every habitat where light reaches the soil surface,'' said Jayne Belnap, a researcher with the United States Geological Survey in Moab, Utah. ''If sunlight reaches the soil, something is going to move in, unless there's something really nasty about that soil.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobile cyanobacteria colonize the soil first, and as they move they leave a ''trail of slime,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said, that glues the soil grains together. Then other less mobile cyanobacteria settle on the surface. If the area gets enough rain, lichens and mosses can grow there, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The crust gets more and more complex,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his laboratory here, he has a library of crust samples in plastic drawers. With their brown soil speckled with lichens and mosses, they look like pans of brownies fresh from the oven. Several are from near Moab, high on the Colorado Plateau. There are some from Gold Canyon, Ariz., just down the road from Tempe in the Sonoran Desert. Others are from Texas, New Mexico and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Garcia-Pichel and his colleagues discovered that the dominant species of cyanobacteria differed depending on location. In colder environments like the Colorado Plateau, one species, M. vaginatus, was dominant; in warmer areas like the Sonoran Desert, another, M. steenstrupii, prevailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In experiments, they found that the temperature differences that determined which microbes would dominate were within the range of increases that are predicted for the Southwest over the next half-century as global warming continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The logical conclusion of that is that the distribution of these microbes will change with global warming,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If M. steenstrupii comes to dominate lands where M. vaginatus once ruled, that may be a problem. Or maybe not -- scientists just don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The genome of M. vaginatus has been sequenced, and scientists know other things about it, including how fast it recovers from drought and its impact on soil fertility. But until Dr. Garcia-Pichel's study, no one had paid any attention to M. steenstrupii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A steenstrupii-dominant crust might have lower fertility, for example, which could mean fewer nutrients in the vegetation consumed by cattle. Or steenstrupii might not hold the soil together as well, leading to greater erosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or perhaps things get better when steenstrupii becomes dominant, Dr. Garcia-Pichel said. ''Maybe it doesn't make a difference. We don't know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time, cyanobacteria and other crust organisms lie dormant in the desert or semidesert. Only when it rains do they come to life, and it takes them a while to get going. While cyanobacteria might start using their stores of carbon and producing carbon dioxide almost immediately upon getting wet, it takes longer for them to make and store new carbon through photosynthesis. They have to repair the photosynthesizing machinery, which gets damaged in the extreme dryness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They've got to gear up,'' Dr. Belnap said. ''They're drinking their coffee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That lag between consumption and production, which can last 20 minutes or longer, affects the organism's survival. If a storm is too short, the soil may dry out before photosynthesis can kick in. ''For any crust, there is a turning point where the frequency of rain does not allow net growth,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said. ''And then you don't have crust anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crusts are already suffering throughout the Southwest because of their fragility. Human footprints, cattle hoofprints or the tires of an A.T.V. can destroy the delicate structure in an instant. Full recovery can take decades. Add climate&nbsp;change to the mix, and the outlook is potentially even bleaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Part of climate&nbsp;change is going to be a change in precipitation patterns,'' Dr. Belnap said. Precisely how those patterns will change is unclear, but if there are more frequent but smaller rainstorms, some desert microbes may be in trouble. Though it is more heat-tolerant than the species it is expected to replace, steenstrupii may be worse at handling whatever changes in precipitation climate&nbsp;change brings. ''The notion that one species is going to replace the other tells you, O.K., there is some danger,'' Dr. Garcia-Pichel said. ''We don't know what it could be, but it's something we should be looking at.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whitebark pine grows in the high, cold reaches of the Rocky and Sierra Mountains, and some trees, wind-bent and tenacious, manage to thrive for more than a thousand years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its hardiness, the species may not survive much longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lethal fungus is decimating the pines, as are voracious mountain pine beetles. Making matters worse, forest managers have suppressed the fires that are required to stimulate whitebark pine seedlings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of all whitebark pines are now dead or dying. In 2012, Canada declared the tree an endangered species, and in the United States it is currently a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the tree faces a new threat: a swiftly changing climate. Temperatures are rising, and Forest Service researchers estimate that 97 percent of the whitebark pine's natural range will disappear from the United States by 2100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, conservation biologists have sought to protect endangered plants and animals where they live, creating refuges where species can be shielded from threats like hunting and pollution. But a refuge won't help the whitebark pine, and so now scientists are pondering a simple but radical new idea: moving the trees to where they will be more comfortable in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's called assisted migration, and the debate over its feasibility comes as biologists everywhere begin to reassess their tactics and the impact of climate&nbsp;change on endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What we were doing wasn't going to protect them in the long term,'' said Bruce Stein, director of the National Wildlife Federation's climate adaptation program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Stein and his colleagues recently published a 272-page guide to ''climate-smart conservation,'' offering advice on how to make ecosystems more resilient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Utah, they noted, is bracing for droughts that may endanger many species. In response, conservation biologists are introducing beavers into the region. The water trapped in beaver dams may support many species and refill underground supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Forest Service drafted a plan for restoring the whitebark pine in 2012, officials didn't just take killer fungi and hungry beetles into account: they also pondered how the trees could best withstand a warming climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their plan calls for rebuilding whitebark pine populations by planting seedlings and setting controlled fires. Healthy forests of whitebark pine, they argue, should be better able to withstand climate&nbsp;change. The trees may even spread northward as higher latitudes develop a suitable climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We feel the bottom line is to help whitebark respond on its own to climate&nbsp;change,'' said Diana F. Tomback, director of the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what if the climate warms too quickly for the trees to respond? Even as the species creeps northward a few miles, it may lose huge swaths of suitable territory to the south. The solution, some conservationists say, may be to help the trees claim new territory more quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assisted migration remains mostly hypothetical. But in 2007, Sally N. Aitken, a geneticist at the University of British Columbia, realized that she could test the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Aitken discovered that the northwestern corner of British Columbia had the right climate for the whitebark pine. But for reasons that weren't clear, the trees didn't grow there. Climate projections indicate that region should still be good for the trees in a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Sierra McLane, a graduate student working with Dr. Aitken, hiked into the remote mountain ranges of British Columbia and planted 18,000 whitebark pine seeds, some as far as 500 miles beyond the tree's current range. About 20 percent of the seeds germinated. Seven years later the trees are still growing, even at the northernmost sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'd say it really is a proof of concept,'' said Dr. Aitken. ''That leads to the question, 'Should we move whitebark pine?' But that's not a biological question.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it's an ethical question that triggers fierce debate in conservation circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have warned that assisted migrations like this could prove to be expensive failures. Even if they succeed, the rescued species may become invasive pests in their new habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brendon Larson, an environmental social scientist at the University of Waterloo, and Clare Palmer, an ethicist at Texas A&amp;M University, argue that assisted migration of the whitebark pine poses little risk because the species grows so slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper to be published in the journal Environmental Values, Dr. Larson and Dr. Palmer conclude that the pros outweigh the cons. Whitebark pines prevent soil erosion and, by trapping snow in the winter, help foster a steady water supply for the valleys below them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And over a hundred species of animals, including bears and birds, depend on the whitebark pine for food and shelter. &quot;It just makes sense to try to maintain them as best we can, and assisted migration could well help with that,'' Dr. Larson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tomback doesn't rule out assisted migration, but she has many doubts. To spread their seeds, whitebark pines depend on birds called Clark's nutcrackers. If the trees are to survive in the long term, conservation biologists also will have to figure out how to establish the birds in their new range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Short of tethering them, what keeps them there?&quot; Dr. Tomback asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert E. Keane, an ecologist at the Rocky Mountain Research Station, believes it would be wiser to find trees that can resist the fungus and use them to plant new forests, which should be maintained with fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In my mind, employing assisted migration is probably the worst thing we can do with any valuable restoration funds,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A less controversial variation of assisted migration involves moving plants or animals within their existing range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a species like the whitebark pine, each population may have evolved adaptations to its local environment, and trees on the southern edge of the range may have genes resistant to heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving some of the southern trees northward could give northern populations the genetic resources to thrive in a warmer climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Influencing the evolution of a wild species in such a way strikes many biologists as a perilous step. But most agree that the choices we've left for ourselves are far from ideal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark W. Schwartz, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis, said: ''You see everybody getting more comfortable with the idea that the future is going to look very different from the past.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Taking a Call for Climate&nbsp;Change to the Streets'' (front page, Sept. 22) and ''Global Rise Reported in 2013 Greenhouse Gas Emissions'' (news article, Sept. 22):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People's Climate March was heartening, but solving the climate crisis will require significant changes at the individual, community and national levels. Despite our efforts so far, global warming continues to accelerate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last four years, I've reduced my carbon emissions to a tenth of their 2010 level (which was near the American average), and I'm happier than ever. The number of people I meet who have made similar reductions is growing, and to a person they also report increased happiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also urgently need meaningful change at the national level. The most effective climate policy the United States could adopt is a revenue-neutral carbon fee. The fee is added to all fossil fuels at points of extraction and import, and then distributed equally to households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from hurting our economy, such a policy would improve our economy by stimulating the transition to renewables and putting money in the average person's pocket. The case of British Columbia, which adopted a revenue-neutral carbon fee in 2008, bears out this bold claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PETER KALMUSAltadena, Calif., Sept. 22, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest near-term opportunities to prevent climate&nbsp;change is to slow down deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, where the lion's share of the world's forest loss is taking place. Brazil has slowed deforestation in the Amazon region by 70 percent, for example, keeping 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and elevating this nation to global leadership in climate&nbsp;change solutions. Nothing Nadine Unger says in ''To Save the Planet, Don't Plant Trees'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 20) changes this achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that trees in the northern latitudes can warm the air by absorbing sunlight -- just think of the leaf that melts a hole into the snow it is lying on during a sunny day. But in the tropics, forests cool the air by forming clouds that bounce sunlight back into space. And when these forests are cleared and burned, black carbon goes into the atmosphere, exacerbating the warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chain saws are not a climate&nbsp;change solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DANIEL NEPSTAD GREGORY ASNER San Francisco, Sept. 22, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nepstad is a senior scientist at the Earth Innovation Institute and a lead author of the International Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change's Fifth Assessment Report (2014). Mr. Asner is a scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I disagree with Daniel C. Esty (''Bottom-Up Climate Fix,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 22) that we should throw in the towel on top-down measures to combat climate&nbsp;change. Local initiatives are crucial to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, but national and international commitments are not the ineffectual measures he makes them out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the European Union's mandate to cut carbon emissions 20 percent by 2020, using 1990 emissions as a baseline. Individual E.U. nations face individually adjusted targets under this regime, expected to yield a 22.2 percent drop in global warming gases by the target date. For 2050, the E.U. has set 80 percent to 95 percent lower emissions as its goal, and is now working with member states to meet interim milestones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Esty also chides ''top-down'' American clean energy programs for ''picking winners.'' This is a caricature of current federal policies, which most prominently feature tax incentives available to homeowners, businesses and utility-scale power generators alike. Together with the renewable electricity mandates adopted by 29 states plus the District of Columbia, federal tax credits are the primary drivers of America's shift toward clean energy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA P&Eacute;ROUSE BAY, Manitoba -- The sea ice here on the western shore of Hudson Bay breaks up each summer and leaves the polar bears swimming for shore. The image of forlorn bears on small rafts of ice has become a symbol of the dangers of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for good reason. A warming planet means less ice coverage of the Arctic Sea, leaving the bears with less time and less ice for hunting seals. They depend on seals for their survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the polar bears here have discovered a new menu option. They eat snow geese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the ice is melting earlier, the bears come on shore earlier, and the timing turns out to be fortunate for them. As a strange side-effect of climate&nbsp;change, polar bears here now often arrive in the midst of a large snow goose summer breeding ground before the geese have hatched and fledged. And with 75,000 pairs of snow geese on the Cape Churchill peninsula -- the result of a continuing goose population explosion -- there is an abundant new supply of food for the bears.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's good for the bears, however, has been devastating to the plants and the landscape, with the geese turning large swaths of tundra into barren mud. Nor does it mean that the bears are going to be O.K. in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is clear is that this long-popular fall destination for polar bear tourism has become a case study in how climate&nbsp;change collides with other environmental changes at the local level and plays out in a blend of domino effects, trade-offs and offsets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The system is a lot more complicated than anybody thought,'' said Robert H. Rockwell, who runs the Hudson Bay Project, a decades-long effort to monitor the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To fully appreciate how the chain reaction plays out in La P&eacute;rouse Bay requires studying the individual links in the chain -- the geese, the bears, and the plants and the land beneath them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rockwell, 68, has been counting geese in this area every summer since 1969. In the late 1970s, he started building his current camp -- a few buildings surrounded by an electric bear fence. It is reachable by helicopter only from nearby Churchill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this vantage point, Dr. Rockwell and his team have witnessed the snow goose population swell to the point where they are harming their own nesting grounds. The number of snow geese that live and migrate in the continent's central flyway exploded from about 1.5 million in the '60s to about 15 million now, and many of them nest here or stop by on their way farther north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for the increase, Dr. Rockwell said, can be traced largely to Louisiana and Texas, in the coastal marshes where the geese long spent their winters feeding on spartina, also known as salt hay or salt meadow cordgrass. They then migrate north in spring to nest and raise goslings on grass and sedges and other plants in the marsh and tundra of the bay shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goose population, Dr. Rockwell said, was once limited in size by its sparse winter food supply in southern states. After many of the marshes were drained for various kinds of development, ''the snow geese just sort of said, well, wait a minute, what was that green stuff just north of here? And it turns out those are the rice prairies,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having found the rice farther north in Louisiana, the geese continued to explore and expand their winter range, finding the vast agricultural fields of the Midwest. ''So a species that was once in part limited by winter habitat now has an infinite winter supply of food, and that includes the best agricultural products: corn, wheat, soybeans, canola, rapeseed, all of that,'' Dr. Rockwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some snow geese now winter in Nebraska and Iowa where these crops are grown. But they keep coming to the sub-Arctic and the Arctic in the summer, following ancient habit. During Dr. Rockwell's time here, the colony increased from 2,500 pairs to 75,000, and the birds moved as far as 20 miles inland as they ruined areas near the coast because of their eating habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing near the shore of Hudson Bay last June after a long, wet hike through bog and mire and stream and willow thicket, Dr. Rockwell surveyed the damage done by geese: acres of muddy, barren terrain -- save for the bleached backbone of a bearded seal -- all but devoid of vegetation. Distant booming signals that the pack ice offshore is starting to break up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The muddy ground used to be like a lawn -- ''golf course quality,'' he said. It is the area where the geese raised their broods after hatching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snow geese graze, eating the tops of plants, and grub, pulling out plants by the roots. They have a serrated beak and a powerful neck, which means they are better able to grip and rip than their Canada geese cousins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But geese not only eat. They are eaten. Many creatures love the eggs and goslings in particular -- arctic foxes, sandhill cranes, gulls and, as it happens, polar bears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Early Bear Gets the Bird</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conventional view is that over all, polar bears are ''food-deprived'' in the summer because there is just not enough food on land to make a significant contribution to their diet. But the snow geese may have changed that, at least here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2007, it was clear that the sea ice was melting earlier, on average, and the polar bears were often coming on shore in time to harvest the eggs from vast numbers of geese and other birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rockwell, a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History, and Linda Gormezano, a graduate student he was supervising, decided to go beyond the sightings of bears eating geese and eggs. They approached the bear diet question in a scientific way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gormezano, who this fall began postdoctoral research at the University of Montana, specializes in noninvasive methods for monitoring the behavior of predators. In terms of diet, scientists can observe what goes in, or what goes out. With an animal like a polar bear, the second approach is more practical. They turned to polar bear feces, or scat, as it is commonly called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gormezano trained a Dutch shepherd named Quinoa to find polar bear scat and drove him north for several field seasons. She and Quinoa worked with Dr. Rockwell to collect and study samples of polar bear scat for several years and found that the bears were eating lots of geese. They were also eating caribou and other animals, as well as berries -- anything in reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Iles, a graduate student at Utah State University, who has been working at La P&eacute;rouse Bay for several years, set out cameras to observe goose nests and caught the bears in the act. He now has 40 cameras set up over a stretch of tundra. They take photographs every two minutes and shoot a burst of 30 images when an animal walks in front of the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to capturing photographs of bears consuming eggs last season, the cameras caught cranes, wolves, eagles and foxes eating. ''Everything seems to love eggs out here,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One goose or one nest may not seem like much. But polar bears are gluttons. Dr, Rockwell described one case in which a bear ate about 1,200 eggs -- of eider ducks, in this case -- in four days. He said Dr. Gormezano had calculated that a clutch of four eggs would amount to 825 calories, the equivalent of one and a half Big Macs. Three hundred four-egg clutches would be 247,500 calories, or about 10 percent of a bear's yearly nutritional needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rockwell and Dr. Gormezano have published several papers on their findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some other polar bear researchers reacted with dismay about how the results may be interpreted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven C. Amstrup, the chief scientist of Polar Bears International, says he does not doubt that bears eat geese but questions how important that fact is. He said he worried that these findings would be taken by the public to mean that polar bears were doing fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What they have established,'' he said of Dr. Rockwell's work, ''is that some bears are eating some goose eggs and even geese. The important question is how many bears are doing that and what is the impact.'' Studies, he said, have shown the condition of polar bears in the Western Hudson Bay is deteriorating, whatever their diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, ''There is the potential for some number of polar bears to offset some of their nutritional losses by taking advantage of goose eggs.'' But, he said, ''It's not reasonable to expect there's going to be some great salvation of polar bears.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, he said, the concern for the bears is long-term and global. In the future, as sea ice declines, ''There's no evidence that anything like current polar bear populations can be supported,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setting aside for a moment what the bears' eating eggs ultimately means for the bears, Dr. Rockwell said their eating habits would not put a real dent in the goose population, as he once hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the geese population to remain constant, a pair of geese needs to have only two surviving offspring in a lifetime of breeding. Snow geese have many chances, typically with five or six seasons of four or five eggs each. Those are good odds for maintaining a stable population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that puts the plants of the tundra in an uncomfortable place, between a goose and a warming trend. What that is doing to plants is what scientists at the Hudson Bay project are studying next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tangled Tundra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The geese, birds, caribou and many other animals here live on plants. Those plants are facing the goose onslaught, an increase in the caribou population and swings in temperature that accompany the changing climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the tundra and marsh may look uniform and dull at first, a closer inspection shows a rich and diverse miniature forest of grasses, sedges, wildflowers, crowberries, cranberries, blueberries, cloudberries and gooseberries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers like Christa Mulder, a plant ecologist, from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, are studying what the plants are doing to better understand how the whole ecosystem is faring. In one project, she is tagging 40 species to see how the timing of their growth is changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She emphasizes that although climate&nbsp;change brings an overall warming trend, it also is bringing increased variation in average temperatures, and the timing of the seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In some years, summer season starts very late,'' she said. ''Some years, it starts very early. Sometimes, the fall comes very late. Sometimes, the fall comes very early.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, she says, ''A cold year slams plants down much harder than a warm year advances them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One aspect Dr. Mulder is studying is how the plants deal with this increased variability. It may be, she said, that for some plants, growth may ultimately be delayed rather than advanced because of the effect of the colder years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One advantage Dr. Mulder has in her studies is a rich historical database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As early as the 1700s, people associated with the Hudson Bay Company were recording the weather. By the 1930s, Churchill was connected to the south by train, and amateur and professional botanists began taking samples of plants, some of which are preserved in museum collections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the 1970s, Robert Jefferies, Dr. Rockwell's longtime collaborator at La P&eacute;rouse Bay, was collecting plants as well. Dr. Mulder can follow the plants' growth patterns over nearly a century, and for years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That future research in La P&eacute;rouse Bay is needed, Dr. Rockwell said, because the current knowledge of how this ecosystem fits together -- and how it is evolving because of climate&nbsp;change -- is so incomplete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You get all these nonlinear kinds of things, which make it very hard to understand,'' he said. ''But it makes it more fun to study.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrison Ford is struggling to keep from jumping out of his chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His face flushes. The veins in his neck bulge. Across an ornate desk, under sharp questioning by Mr. Ford, the man in charge of Indonesia's forests smiles wanly as he tries to explain just how he managed to allow a national park to be chopped down for the production of palm oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the more vivid scenes in ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' an award-winning documentary series that ran on Showtime this summer. Viewers -- after watching wanton forest destruction earlier in the episode, and seeing Mr. Ford gently caress endangered orangutans made homeless by it -- will be hard pressed not to root for him as he confronts a representative of the Indonesian government, known for its corruption.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showtime is a premium channel, which means that many American households did not have the chance to see ''Years of Living Dangerously.'' That is a shame, and now it is fixable: The series has become available on streaming services like iTunes, Amazon and Vimeo on Demand, with more to follow. The series is also out on DVD for $50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With nine episodes running nearly an hour apiece, ''Years'' represents a serious time commitment. But that time will be rewarded, because this is the best American television series ever done on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admittedly, there is not much competition. Ask anyone in the television news business why the industry has done so little on the subject, and the answer you will probably hear is, ''What are the pictures?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' Joel Bach, David Gelber and their colleagues have provided the answer. Frustrated by the poor coverage, Mr. Bach and Mr. Gelber -- who are former ''60 Minutes'' producers -- raised some $15 million to go after the subject in a visually arresting way. They helped their fund-raising by signing up Hollywood celebrities to appear on camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Bach and Mr. Gelber did not fall into the trap of asking the celebrities what they think about climate&nbsp;change. Instead, the crucial, unexpected plot twist that helps make the series work is that the producers essentially turn their celebrity talent into journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They sent actors like Mr. Ford, Ian Somerhalder, America Ferrera, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle to the front lines to ask questions. (The producers did use a few working journalists, too, including Thomas L. Friedman and Mark Bittman, who write for The New York Times.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the series unfolds, the stars head to burning forests, dying fisheries, eroding coasts and drought-stricken farms. The answers they get about what is happening to our world come from scientists who are candid about the uncertainties and from ordinary people who are experiencing the effects of climatic disruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The producers do not shy away from the issue of why so many people in the United States still have trouble believing climate&nbsp;change is real, which steers them repeatedly into the tense dialogue between science and evangelical Christianity. Every episode has gripping moments. Mr. Ford's confrontation with the Indonesian forest minister became national news in that country. In one segment, a daughter devoting her life to climate&nbsp;change has a fierce argument about the causes with her father, Rick Joyner, a megachurch pastor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gelber and Mr. Bach earned accolades for their work last month, when they won an Emmy award for best documentary series. They have begun plotting a second series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, they will use movie stars again. Doing so can open doors, and hearts and minds. In an interview, Mr. Gelber pointed out that the dashing Mr. Somerhalder had managed to interest his five million Twitter followers in the subject.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mayor de Blasio Commits to 80 Percent Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050,'' said the Sunday news release, outlining what would be a truly impressive feat if he actually were able to make good on that promise. But there is not going to be any 89-year-old, 10-term mayor named de Blasio declaring a local victory in the battle to save the planet. This is a long march to a distant goal. The commitment Mr. de Blasio made over the weekend -- an excellent and necessary one -- was to do his part now to keep the city moving in the right direction: Promised Land, that way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so, the mayor -- joined by the City Council, whose speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has announced legislation to meet the same goals -- has put the city within an emerging mainstream. So-called ''80 by 50'' pledges have been made by many other cities, states and governments here and abroad, including New York State, which set that goal for itself in 2009. And Mr. de Blasio is, in fact, continuing ambitious work begun by his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, whose 2007 greener-city agenda, called PlaNYC, provided a road map for the changes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PlaNYC proposed reducing emissions 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and in a report in December, laid out the next steps that would be needed to reach the 80-by-50 goal. It bluntly described that goal as ''theoretically feasible'' but cautioned that reaching it would require change on an ''unprecedented scale,'' including huge investments in energy efficiency and ''wholesale transition'' to low-carbon transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. deBlasio's plan focuses on making the city's buildings more energy-efficient, through strict regulations on new buildings and retrofitting existing ones, particularly the crumbling stock of public-housing apartments. This is just where the initial focus should be: residential and commercial buildings account for nearly three-fourths of the city's carbon-dioxide emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the plan will cost billions. Mr. de Blasio has naturally been stressing the sunny side of the mission ahead, noting that many changes will pay for themselves, create jobs, cut utility bills and make the air cleaner. He has also acknowledged that the job is daunting and difficult and that many changes may have to be mandated if private buildings don't meet emissions-reduction targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York has now become the largest city to accept this 80-by-50 challenge, as it should. It needs to be a leader in word and deed. It's home to the United Nations, after all, and the natural setting for events like the passionate weekend march for climate&nbsp;change at which more than 300,000 people sounded the alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, efforts to reduce emissions through top-down global agreements have been stymied by political disagreements, and until these differences are resolved, meaningful changes will have to come from the bottom up, with local leaders setting worthy examples. New York has been lucky to have two mayors in a row to acknowledge both the facts and the fearsomeness of confronting climate&nbsp;change, and to get things moving. The difficult follow-through is next.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats need to find a way to succeed in two red states this year. If they can do that -- preventing Republican victories in some combination of Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana or North Carolina -- Democrats can pull off a modest upset and keep control of the Senate this year. Otherwise, Mitch McConnell will probably achieve his dream of becoming Senate majority leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with six weeks left in the campaign, it's worth asking a slightly mischievous question: Why does the Senate matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of which party controls it, Republicans will almost certainly control the House, and Democrats will hold the White House. Given how far apart the two parties are on almost every major issue -- climate, health care, inequality, the long-term deficit, immigration and same-sex marriage, for starters -- the odds of major legislation becoming law in the next two years are scant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming weeks, you will hear a lot of speculation about the ways in which a Republican Senate and Mr. Obama may conceivably find common ground in 2015 and 2016. Don't take that speculation too seriously. By now, we all should have learned that ''grand bargain'' is a synonym for ''pipe dream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet control of the Senate still very much matters, just not for the most obvious reasons. It matters for climate policy and the Affordable Care Act, among other big issues. It also matters for the future prospects of major legislation, even if none is likely to pass in the next two years. Here's a guide to the actual stakes in this year's midterms:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate. This issue leads the list because of its importance. No one can know the precise course of climate&nbsp;change. It's highly uncertain. But the risks are now serious and rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the mild summer in parts of the United States, 2014 is on pace to be either the planet's warmest or third warmest on record, depending on which data you use. Here are the 10 warmest years on record -- going back to 1880 -- according to NASA: 2010, 2005, 2007, 1998, 2013, 2002, 2006, 2003, 2009, 2012. The knock-on effects appear to include increasing risk of floods, extreme storms, species extinction and drought, like the brutal current drought in California and the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, having failed to pass a sweeping climate bill, has instead used executive actions to regulate pollution by automakers and power plants. Combined, the actions would make a significant dent in carbon emissions in coming decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Mr. Obama would veto any stand-alone law to neuter his policies. Knowing this, Mr. McConnell has instead said he would embed restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency in broader budget bills. ''I assure you that in the spending bill, we will be pushing back against this bureaucracy,'' Mr. McConnell recently told Republican donors. If Mr. Obama vetoed those budget bills, the government would shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government shutdowns have generally hurt Republicans in recent years, and the party has tended to fold in the end. But the politics could be different if the forcing mechanism were Mr. Obama's veto. At the very least, he may have to compromise over climate policy even more than he has so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McConnell has said he will also try to undercut Wall Street regulation and the 2010 health care law through budget bills. But he has emphasized climate policy. Republican control of the Senate would probably mean less climate regulation -- and more carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courts. President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton each placed a lot of federal judges on the bench in their last two years in office. Mr. Obama may not be able to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last two decades, both parties have become more aggressive at blocking the other's judicial nominees. And Republicans have gone further than Democrats. Among Mr. Obama's nominees to the District Courts (which conduct federal trials), 16 percent have failed to be confirmed, according to Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution. That's similar to Mr. Clinton's 17 percent failure rate at the same point in his presidency. Mr. Bush's comparable failure rate was only 11 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Democrats eliminated the filibuster last year for judicial nominees, allowing a simple majority of senators to confirm federal judges. The change has helped Mr. Obama put judges on the bench. Yet it has also made the process even more polarized, and a Republican-run Senate may simply refuse to fill judicial openings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A total shutdown is not out of the question,'' said Mr. Wheeler, perhaps the leading student of the confirmation process. If that happens, Mr. Obama could end up leaving a smaller imprint on the courts than his predecessors, seating dozens fewer judges than either of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal courts only occasionally burst into the headlines, but they have a large influence. They often have the final say on policies relating to immigration, labor unions, business regulation, climate&nbsp;change, health care and same-sex marriage. The biggest issues go to the Supreme Court, but lower courts decide most questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the Supreme Court: If a justice were to resign or die unexpectedly in the next two years, the Obama nominee who could win confirmation from a Republican Senate would be quite different from the kind of nominee a Democratic Senate would confirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future. Remember one of the first lessons from civics class: Senators serve for six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if no major legislation is likely in the next two years, the people elected this November will be in the Senate for another four. The 2014 elections could well mean the difference between a Democratic Senate and a Republican Senate in 2017. (The map is more favorable to Democrats two years from now than this year.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine a Washington in 2017 in which President Marco Rubio and a Republican House want to cut top tax rates sharply -- but Senator Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat who squeaked out a win in 2014, is part of a 51-member Democratic Senate caucus that stands in the way. Or imagine that President Hillary Clinton wants to push an immigration overhaul -- but can't get any momentum behind a bill in either a Republican-led Senate or House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, once again, there's the Supreme Court. In 2018, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will turn 85, while Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia will turn 82. Anyone elected to the Senate this year is likely to vote on at least one Supreme Court nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is to say that while the 2014 election is certainly is not the most important of our lifetimes, it is important in some stealth ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With six weeks to go, the Republicans have taken leads over Democratic incumbents in Arkansas and Louisiana, while Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, another Democratic incumbent, is in better shape. The four tossups are in Alaska, Colorado, Iowa and -- surprisingly enough -- Kansas. The Democrats would need positive results in three of those four, along with North Carolina, to keep control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Upshot's Senate forecasting model currently gives the Republicans a 57 percent chance of victory. That's a real advantage, but it's not a large one. To put it in terms of baseball, another subject that will occupy much of the next six weeks: The Democrats, for all their troubles, still have a better chance of keeping the Senate than even today's best hitters have of reaching base.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The U.N. Secretary General builds public and private commitments that could slow global warming and blunt its impacts. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's heartening to review the summary of governmental and private climate and energy commitments compiled by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the end of his daylong climate&nbsp;change summit. They range from a substantial new push to reduce and eventually eliminate forest loss to boosted investment in a planned clean-energy corridor in Africa. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between this summit and the meeting the secretary general convened in 2009 is enormous. The goal five years ago was to build momentum to &quot;seal the deal&quot; on a binding climate treaty - a fruitless task given the divisions among the world's nations - while this conclave was centered on a more modest, but more concrete, achievement - &quot;to raise political momentum for a meaningful universal climate agreement [notice there's no mention of the word &quot;binding&quot;] in Paris in 2015 and to galvanize transformative action in all countries to reduce emissions and build resilience to the adverse impacts of climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some significant bullet points from the summary once you get beyond the boilerplate: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paths to cuts in emissions: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The New York Declaration on Forests, launched and supported by more than 150 partners, including 28 government, 8 subnational governments, 35 companies, 16 indigenous peoples groups, and 45 NGO and civil society groups, aims to halve the loss of natural forests globally by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Twenty-four leading global producers of palm oil as well as commodities traders committed to contribute to the goal of zero net deforestation by 2020 and to work with Governments, private sector partners and indigenous peoples to ensure a sustainable supply chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Some of the world's largest retailers of meat and agricultural products committed to adapt their supply chains to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate&nbsp;change. They will assist 500 million farmers in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial moves:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A coalition of institutional investors, committed to decarbonizing $100 billion by December 2015 and to measure and disclose the carbon footprint of at least $500 billion in investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The insurance industry committed to double its green investments to $84 billion by the end of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy and agriculture:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Leaders from 19 countries and 32 partners from Government, regional organisations, development institutions and private investors committed to creating an 8,000 kilometre-long African Clean Energy Corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture, comprised of 16 countries and 37 organisations, was launched to enable 500 million farmers worldwide to practice climate-smart agriculture by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Leaders of the oil and gas industry, along with national Governments and civil society organisations, made an historic commitment to identify and reduce methane emissions by 2020. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A second industry-led initiative was launched by leading producers of petroleum who committed to address methane as well as other key climate challenges, followed by regular reporting on ongoing efforts. Industry leaders and Governments also committed to reduce HFCs in refrigeration and food storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are modest moves. Many were already in the works. But this is a long climate and energy march and it's great to see the United Nations helping highlight and sustain such initiatives.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Climate activists should note that the arms-reduction movement is experiencing significant setbacks. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1982, up to a million demonstrators gathered in Central Park calling for a nuclear freeze. They were protesting the Reagan-era nuclear arms buildup and other developments they saw, not unreasonably, as a threat to civilization and to life on Earth, including talk by some Reagan aides about fighting and winning a nuclear war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Sunday - a generation later -hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took part in the People's Climate March in Manhattan to protest international inaction on global warming, which they see, not unreasonably, as a threat to civilization and to life on Earth.The front page of The New York Times on Monday brought the two events together, in an unintended though instructive way. The photographs were of the climate marchers. &nbsp;But the lead story was about the current aggressive efforts to rebuild the nation's nuclear arsenal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that, 32 years after the Central Park gathering, progress on significant arms reductions is going into reverse is something the climate marchers should note. Because, intentionally or not, the climate&nbsp;change movement mirrors the nuclear freeze in many ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are rooted in the idea of a global planetary emergency. Both grew along with scientific evidence that challenges the status quo in politics and industry. Both are attempting to change and harness public opinion as a way to get policymakers to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both gained popular momentum with the emergence of prominent leaders with Academy Award-winning documentaries: The nuclear freeze had Dr. Helen Caldicott and the anti-nuclear documentary &quot;If You Love This Planet,&quot; which featured Dr. Caldicott and won the Oscar in 1982 for Best Documentary Short Subject; the fight against global warming has Al Gore and the documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth,&quot; which featured Mr. Gore and won the Oscar in 2006 for Best Documentary Feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both movements have produced Nobel Peace Prize winners:&nbsp; In 1985, for the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a group that Dr. Caldicott helped establish; in 2007, for Mr. Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even some of the motivating images in each movement are similar. Models have suggested that nuclear war, if unleashed, threatens nuclear winter, with reduced sunlight and cold temperatures for a prolonged period. &nbsp;Global warming, unchecked, will lead to ever more extreme temperatures and violent weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now both movements have involved mass demonstrations in New York with other rallies held and planned elsewhere around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lessons of the nuclear freeze movement is that it's difficult to sustain a protest effort, especially one that is not focused on a specific target. &nbsp;The nuclear freeze was strongest when it was protesting the handling of a prominent geopolitical challenge (the U.S. vs. the U.S.S.R.) and specific weapons systems (cruise missiles in Europe.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, global-warming activists may have more success by focusing on wildlife that is endangered (polar bears or butterflies) or specific areas (rain forests) or specific ways of life (coastal cities or island nations) rather than on broad existential threats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Climate change affects everyone, but some more than others. The People&amp;#8217;s Climate March showed that a movement for reform has grown to encompass many issues, with social justice at the forefront. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some unlikely groups marched side by side among the estimated 300,000-strong People's Climate March, organized to put pressure on politicians gathering at this week's United Nations Climate Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing purple T-shirts, a group of Sisters of Mercy - as one of them put it, &quot;commonly known as nuns&quot; - came to the march from all around the northeast of the country. The women told Op-Talk they were protesting because earth and &quot;creation&quot; are being destroyed, polluted. &quot;It's a matter of justice, and we're about justice and compassion for anyone who is marginalized or oppressed, and the earth is among those,&quot; said Frances Thomas, 71.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not far, a group of wholly different &quot;sisters&quot; marched, wearing green. One of the protesters was Bridget Burns, 29, the advocacy and communications director for the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that helped organize the women's contingent of the march. &quot;We're here to talk about climate&nbsp;change being an issue of social justice,&quot; Ms. Burns told Op-Talk. &quot;Yes, it impacts everyone, but impacts people differently, depending on who has access to resources. And that has a gendered face, a woman's face,&quot; she said, explaining that women are particularly affected by natural disasters from droughts to tsunamis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march carried many&nbsp;messages from many&nbsp;individuals and groups -&nbsp;as many as 1,300 - from &quot;Moms Clean Air Force&quot; to activists from the AIDS awareness group Act Up. But the overarching demand was clear: Climate&nbsp;change is a problem, and something needs to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first step is to just acknowledge that something is happening,&quot; the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt told Op-Talk. &quot;Big money has been able to frame the conversation such that a lot of people still think it's debatable whether it's been happening or not.&quot; What was valuable about the march, with its overwhelming and diverse turnout, Mr. Gordon-Levitt said, is that it made the climate movement's claims &quot;irrefutable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voice of global concern for action on climate&nbsp;change is back, and this time it's no longer an environmental issue, it's an everybody issue,&quot; one of the march's organizers, Ricken Patel of Avaaz, a global activism movement, wrote in an&nbsp;op-ed for CNN. &quot;Climate&nbsp;change has gone beyond environmentalism, it's now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcelo Magnasco, 50, a biophysicist at the Rockefeller University in New York, marched in his white lab coat. &quot;I'm one of the 97 percent of scientists that believe that climate&nbsp;change is real, and its anthropogenic,&quot; he told Op-Talk. Mr. Magnasco brought his entire family to the march, including his 5-year-old daughter, Luna. &quot;This is my children's fight. We are leaving them this mess, aren't we?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The younger generation is already fighting, and in large numbers. A numerous, and loud, contingent of students representing the movement pushing colleges to divest from fossil fuels marched holding a sign saying &quot;Our Future, Our Choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our futures and our values are at stake&quot; said Iliana Salazar-Dodge, 19, a sophomore at Columbia. Ms. Salazar-Dodge is part of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, a group of activists on 400 campuses across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Salazar-Dodge echoed Ms. Burns's sentiment that climate&nbsp;change affects some people more than others. &quot;People of low socioeconomic status as well as indigenous people in tropical regions would be most affected by sea level rise,&quot; she told Op-Talk, adding that she was concerned for her own family in Mexico, which was recently hit by one of the most severe storms in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sense of urgency was emphasized by the march's organizers. &quot;There is a gap between the speed of action our survival requires and the action our governments are taking,&quot; Mr. Patel writes. &quot;The street is how we close that gap, because politicians will move faster when people move them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill McKibben, another organizer and founder of 350.org,&nbsp;writes at The New Yorker that &quot;marches aren't subtle; they don't lay out detailed manifestos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the night before, one such manifesto was introduced at the Climate Convergence conference that accompanied the march. Naomi Klein, a journalist, activist and author of the books &quot;No Logo&quot; and &quot;The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,&quot; spoke at St. Peter's Church in Midtown Manhattan about her new book, &quot;This Changes Everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easier to imagine turning down the temperature of the sun, Ms. Klein said, than changing the rules governing our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;these are the choices that we have before us, this is why climate&nbsp;change changes everything,&quot; Ms. Klein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her book, Ms. Klein argues that the root cause of climate&nbsp;change is capitalism, emphasizing that if no profound and radical changes to the system are made, a climate catastrophe is inevitable. &quot;The bottom line is what matters here: Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war,&quot; Ms. Klein writes. &quot;Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it's not the laws of nature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both in her book and during the talk, Ms. Klein admitted that she, along with many others on the left, had ignored the importance of climate&nbsp;change for years. While talking to an activist from a developing country, she writes, she realized not only the urgency of the problem but a potential for larger change that could eliminate the inequality plaguing our societies while at the same time alleviating climate&nbsp;change. Some of her solutions include &quot;rebuilding and reviving local economies&quot; or &quot;reclaiming our democracies from corrosive corporate influence,&quot; and blocking new free trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of climate&nbsp;change cannot be left to governments whose efforts -&nbsp;begun&nbsp;in the late 1980s&nbsp;-&nbsp;have largely been sluggish and ineffective. Some preliminary data show that since 1990, carbon emissions rose by 61 percent, Ms. Klein points out. In &quot;This Changes Everything,&quot; she dismisses the partnership between big green groups and corporations and calls for a mass, grass-roots movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While 'power to the people' may seem an uninspired way to change the world's dominating socioeconomic systems, Klein's sharp analysis makes a compelling case that a mass awakening is part of the answer,&quot; writes Chris Bentley in a review of the book for The Chicago Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book has also drawn criticism. Both Mr. Bentley and John Gray at The Guardian criticize Ms. Klein for the relative lack of specific ideas for an alternative economic system to the one she demolishes in her argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gray writes that her central argument is faulty. Humans have been causing damage to the climate long before the rise of capitalism, he says. Instead of framing it as a clash between the planet and capitalism, it would be &quot;more accurate&quot; to say the conflict is between &quot;the expanding demands of humankind and a finite world.&quot; He adds, on a more optimistic note that the winner is clear: &quot;The Earth is vastly older and stronger than the human animal.&quot;                      </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good Tuesday morning and welcome to First Draft's second day. It is a busy one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama heads to New York on Tuesday morning to address world leaders just hours after opening a new front in the war against Islamic extremists with an aerial barrage in Syria. But unlike with previous armed conflicts, he will be seeking support, not permission. (Russia would say no, anyway.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president stayed out of sight on Monday night even as the Pentagon confirmed the first strikes inside Syria against the terrorist group known as the Islamic State. He had told the nation in a speech Sept. 10 that he had authorized such strikes, but he left it to military commanders to decide when and where to open the air campaign. The White House said only that he was kept updated on the operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So his trip to New York for three days of meetings with presidents and prime ministers at the United Nations General Assembly meeting will present Mr. Obama with his first chance to talk publicly about the airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president will in effect be presenting his peers with a fait accompli and asking them to individually stand by his decision, even though he does not have an invitation from Syria's government to use force inside its borders against the terrorist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in New York, Mr. Obama will also seek to pass a Security Council resolution calling on all nations to prosecute those who travel abroad to join terrorist organizations or help finance them. And he will meet with Haider al-Abadi, the new Iraqi prime minister, whom Mr. Obama hopes to make a strong ally in the fight against the Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Scrutiny for the Secret Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secret Service is about to experience some of the toughest questioning it has ever faced in the wake of Friday's White House breach. Its director, Julia Pierson, is scrambling to defend her agency - and her own performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview to be published later Tuesday, Ms. Pierson describes the mood Sunday night as 700 agents and officers gathered in New York to prepare for the start of the United Nations General Assembly meeting. It had been just two days since an intruder jumped the White House fence and got through the North Portico doors before being tackled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she urged her employees to ignore second-guessing from critics: &quot;We need to be fully vigilant professionals, although we are in the media again.&quot; She exhorted them to &quot;make sure we're focused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will she be able to hold off calls for changes in practices and personnel? A string of controversies (some involving agents and prostitutes) and security lapses has exposed the Secret Service to withering criticism. And Friday's fence-jumper could produce calls for more sweeping changes. Already, a House hearing into the matter has been set for next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, promises to be rigorous. &quot;We have a lot of good men and women, but their leadership has some serious questions to answer,&quot; he said. &quot;Over the last five years or so, their luster of elite protection has lost its shine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Michael S. Schmidt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Plans for Climate&nbsp;Change, With No Guarantees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1 p.m. before the United Nations on Tuesday, President Obama will present his blueprints for confronting climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he nears the twilight of his term, a reality is sinking in. Most of the work will have to be done by Mr. Obama's successor. Or maybe the president after that. Or the president 20 years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is also no guarantee that what the administration proposes Tuesday will be enacted, given a reluctant Congress, or that what is enacted will be enough to hold off the worst climate&nbsp;changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will be front and center at the gathering. She will not only be traveling to New York with the president, but will also be sitting directly behind him as he addresses world leaders. In the face of a resistant Congress, Mr. Obama has used the agency to push through new policies, including a sweeping effort to curtail coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8203;&#8203;</SPAN>&quot;This is not a talking point,&quot; said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the E.P.A. &quot;The U.S. is using the E.P.A. to show its leadership internationally.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Affordable Care Act has waned as a campaign issue, but HealthCare.gov is being overhauled, and a new enrollment season is on the horizon. At 1:35 p.m., Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell will share the latest on the law in a speech at the Brookings Institution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two ugliest ties in Washington. Credit Jason Horowitz/The New York Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two ugliest ties in Washington are stored in a House supply closet with markers, Post-it notes and VHS cassettes of past proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to call the pink one 'the tie of shame,' &quot; said Laura Reed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Ms. Reed and her colleagues at the House Press Gallery have lent the silk ties out to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of reporters who have lacked the appropriate attire to chat with members in the Speaker's Lobby downstairs. Often the reporters ask if there are other options. There are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eagle brand pink tie has a kaleidoscope pattern and is mottled with blue cornflowers and a stain that could be chocolate, salsa or dried blood. (&quot;That's new,&quot; observed Ms. Reed.) The vastly more popular choice is paisley blue, made by Tommy Hilfiger, and split at the seams to reveal a foam stuffing. &quot;It has seen better days,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many is not entirely clear. Ric Andersen, who sits in front of the closet and has worked at the House for 15 years, said the ties predated him. &quot;Nobody knows where they came from,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the &quot;umbrella of shame&quot; that is also stored in the gallery (yellow, with the word shame written in red), no reporter has tried to steal the House neck wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ties,&quot; Ms. Reed said, &quot;always come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two ugliest ties in Washington. Credit Jason Horowitz/The New York Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two ugliest ties in Washington are stored in a House supply closet with markers, Post-it notes and VHS cassettes of past proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to call the pink one 'the tie of shame,' &quot; said Laura Reed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Ms. Reed and her colleagues at the House Press Gallery have lent the silk ties out to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of reporters who have lacked the appropriate attire to chat with members in the Speaker's Lobby downstairs. Often the reporters ask if there are other options. There are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eagle brand pink tie has a kaleidoscope pattern and is mottled with blue cornflowers and a stain that could be chocolate, salsa or dried blood. (&quot;That's new,&quot; observed Ms. Reed.) The vastly more popular choice is paisley blue, made by Tommy Hilfiger, and split at the seams to reveal a foam stuffing. &quot;It has seen better days,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many is not entirely clear. Ric Andersen, who sits in front of the closet and has worked at the House for 15 years, said the ties predated him. &quot;Nobody knows where they came from,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the &quot;umbrella of shame&quot; that is also stored in the gallery (yellow, with the word shame written in red), no reporter has tried to steal the House neck wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ties,&quot; Ms. Reed said, &quot;always come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good chilly Tuesday morning. Welcome to fall.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When German artists claimed responsibility for planting two white flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge over the summer, they said they were tributes to the bridge's builders, John and Washington Roebling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps there should have been a third flag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Warren Roebling, Washington's wife, oversaw the engineering on the bridge construction for more than a decade after her husband was disabled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are women behind other celebrated sites in our city, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, for example, was designed by Beatrix Farrand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The triangular arrangement, with radiating paths and flower beds, is considered one of the most beautiful rose gardens in the world.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The skyscraper originally known as the Union Carbide Building, which now houses the JPMorgan Chase world headquarters on Park Avenue, was designed by Natalie de Blois. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The steel-and-glass tower became an icon of 1960s architecture; the architect did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To commemorate women's contributions in the field, the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation has started a project called Built by Women NYC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is looking for 100 structures or built environments in New York City designed or constructed by women, to include in walking tours, interactive maps and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is accepting nominations through Oct. 31. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this date in 1938, the so-called 5,000-Year Time Capsule was buried at the site of the upcoming 1939 World's Fair, in Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time capsule, to be opened in 6939, contained more than 100 items. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included a woman's hat, a man's pipe, a lump of coal, poker chips, a message from Albert Einstein and a 10 million word &quot;record of our present day civilization,&quot; The Timesreported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The record was compressed into 1,100 feet of microfilm.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merely 25 years later, the torpedo-like capsule was disinterred, and plans were made to replace it with a new one at the 1964 World's Fair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new capsule will incorporate advances since 1938 in medicine, and health, space science, atomic energy, the start and conclusion of World War II and other interim information,&quot; The Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A book giving the first capsule's exact location had been published and sent to 3,000 libraries and monasteries around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A comparable book will be prepared for the new capsule,&quot; The Times assured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of people from Melbourne to Manhattan took to the streets yesterday to demand their leaders act on global warming, in the biggest display of public support for action to tackle climate&nbsp;change yet seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People's Climate March, whose organisers claimed it included 580,000 people at at least 2,700 events in 161 countries, comes before a summit of about 120 leaders at the UN, the first such gathering for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan a noisy, hopeful cavalcade estimated by organisers at 310,000 protesters, led by Hurricane Sandy survivors carrying placards of sunflowers and native Americans in traditional headdresses, took over the streets of Midtown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juggling, singing, blowing synagogue shofars, whistling and beating drums, they chugged along in biodiesel-powered floats. They were joined by celebrities including the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who was appointed last week as a UN climate&nbsp;change ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it will make a difference,&quot; said Tashina Red Hawk, 10, from the Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, who was wearing the intricately beaded traditional Sioux Indian dress. &quot;But it would still be good to do all kinds of other stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, organisers said 40,000 people marched along the sunlit streets, through the city centre and on to the Houses of Parliament. The protest was peaceful, although loud jeers erupted as the crowd passed Downing Street and the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change. In Melbourne, protesters paraded a giant puppet of Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known that left unchecked, the world is on course for a 4.5C temperature rise, a level that would inflict catastrophes on some of the poorest countries, submerging coastlines through sea-level rises and scorching fields with heatwaves and drought. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington announced just last week that June, July and August had been the hottest months on record and that 2014 was on course to break the record for hottest year, which was set in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the agenda for tomorrow's gathering in New York is uncertain. The UN has said repeatedly that the event is not about negotiations. It will be in Lima, in two months' time, that the final stretch of long and difficult negotiations will take place, aiming at an international agreement to cut the greenhouse gases that cause climate&nbsp;change by late 2015 in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the UN said, tomorrow's gathering would press world leaders to do more: to cut more carbon and, for the rich countries, release more cash to help poorer nations cope with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at yesterday's protests - which in New York included the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the former US vice-president Al Gore - said that by being in the streets they could help propel world leaders to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't get 200 people together and not have something get out of it. It's going to be huge,&quot; said Mark Ruffalo, the actor, who is a prominent supporter of environmental causes. &quot;I don't know exactly the effect, but I promise you one, five, 10, 15 leaders are going to come out of it, and do something. Somebody is going to want to be a hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London the compere kicked off the rally by asking the crowd: &quot;Who's sick of the ice receding faster than David Cameron's hairline?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Chartres, the bishop of London, told the rally: &quot;We are tenants, and we must keep the Earth fit for our children. Climate&nbsp;change is a moral issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma Thompson, the actor, said: &quot;Every single person on this Earth has the power to change the world. When we all come together, our power becomes irresistible. Now we must use our power to tackle the biggest threat humanity has ever faced.&quot; Earlier she had said: &quot;Unless we're carbon-free by 2030 the world is buggered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The designer Vivienne Westwood railed against capitalism in her address: &quot;A triad of (fossil fuel) monopolies, banks and politicians are ruining the planet. If runaway climate&nbsp;change kicks in, then within a generation, there will be very little habitable on the planet and the suffering will be unimaginable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers' costumes included polar bear and gazelle outfits. One gazelle, Merlin from Brighton, said: &quot;People are important, but animals are vital as well. We are here representing all the animals not here today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paris organisers said about 8,000 people marched. Antoine Heron, a Parisian and retired engineer, said the march was big, but not compared with the social action for which Paris was famous. &quot;It's not so big as if it were (for) salaries and political matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiger costumes at the People's Climate March in central London flag up the perils of vanishing habitats. Other cities hosting marches included Melbourne (top right) and Brussels (right). Below, the UN's secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, with Leonardo DiCaprio</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By JENNIFER MEDINA</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown of California has signed several bills to help build the market for electric cars in his state, two days ahead of speaking alongside world leaders at the United Nations this week for a summit meeting on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation is designed to make electric cars more affordable for low-income residents, and the intent is to have at least one million zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles on the state's roads by 2023.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California already has more electric vehicles on its roads than any other state, with an estimated 40 percent of all electric cars sold in the United States driven by the state's residents. Earlier this month, the Plug-in Electric Vehicle Collaborative, a coalition of advocacy groups and car manufacturers, announced that more than 100,000 plug-in cars had been sold in the state during the last four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has made combating climate&nbsp;change a cornerstone of his administration, traveling to China and Mexico to sign agreements to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. He has also continued to call for enforcement of the state's cap-and-trade program, even as some have called for it to be scaled back while the economy is sputtering. On Tuesday, he will participate in a panel discussing cities' roles in fighting climate&nbsp;change and another on carbon pricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are carrying on because we know in California that carbon pollution kills, it undermines our environment, and long-term, it's an economic loser,'' Mr. Brown said in a video statement posted online in advance of this week's summit meeting. ''We face an existential challenge with the changes in our climate. The time to act is now, the place to look is California. We're not finished, but we sure are setting the pace.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the legislation, the State Air Resources Board will be asked to draft a plan that does more to allow low-income residents to access the state's rebate program, implemented in 2010. So far, the program has issued more than 75,000 rebates for electric and hybrid cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plan will give low-income drivers who want to purchase or lease an electric car extra credits. Related legislation that Mr. Brown signed Sunday will also install charging stations for electric vehicles in apartment buildings in low-income neighborhoods and offer assistance to car-sharing programs as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown also signed related legislation that allows more electric vehicles to use car pool lanes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John D. Rockefeller built a vast fortune on oil. Now his heirs are abandoning fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family whose legendary wealth flowed from Standard Oil is planning to announce on Monday that its $860 million philanthropic organization, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is joining the divestment movement that began a couple years ago on college campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement, timed to precede Tuesday's opening of the United Nations climate&nbsp;change summit meeting in New York City, is part of a broader and accelerating initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, 180 institutions -- including philanthropies, religious organizations, pension funds and local governments -- as well as hundreds of wealthy individual investors have pledged to sell assets tied to fossil fuel companies from their portfolios and to invest in cleaner alternatives. In all, the groups have pledged to divest assets worth more than $50 billion from portfolios, and the individuals more than $1 billion, according to Arabella Advisors, a firm that consults with philanthropists and investors to use their resources to achieve social goals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who are selling shares of energy stocks are well aware that their actions are unlikely to have an immediate impact on the companies, given their enormous market capitalizations and cash flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, some say they are taking action to align their assets with their environmental principles. Others want to shame companies that they believe are recklessly contributing to a warming planet. Still others say that the fight to limit climate&nbsp;change will lead to new regulations and disruptive new technologies that will make these companies an increasingly risky investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the activist investors say, their actions, like those of the anti-apartheid divestment fights of the 1980s, could help spur international debate, while the shift of investment funds to energy alternatives could lead to solutions to the carbon puzzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a threshold moment,'' said Ellen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, which has coordinated the effort to recruit foundations to the cause. ''This movement has gone from a small activist band quickly into the mainstream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone will divest completely or right away, Ms. Dorsey noted, and some are divesting just from specific sectors of the fossil fuel industry, such as coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The key thing is that they are moving along toward a common destination,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the individual investors joining in the announcement on Monday is Mark Ruffalo, the actor. The news conference will include a videotaped message from Bishop Desmond Tutu, who said that because climate&nbsp;change has a disproportionate impact on the poor, it is ''the human rights challenge of our time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how transparent the various funds and institutions will be about the progress of their asset sales is uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, there is no equivocation but there is caution, said Stephen Heintz, its president. The fund has already eliminated investments involved in coal and tar sands entirely while increasing its investment in alternate energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unwinding other investments in a complex portfolio from the broader realm of fossil fuels will take longer. ''We're moving soberly, but with real commitment,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Rockefeller, a son of Nelson A. Rockefeller and a trustee of the fund, said that he foresees financial problems ahead for companies that have stockpiled more reserves than they can burn without contributing significantly to climate damage. ''We see this as having both a moral and economic dimension,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activism to divest from fossil fuel companies began on college campuses, but the record of success there has been mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university with the biggest endowment, Harvard, has declined to divest, despite pressure from many students and outside organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's president, has issued statements that she and her colleagues do not believe that divestment is ''warranted or wise,'' and argued that the school's $32.7 billion endowment ''is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford recently announced it would divest its holdings in the coal industry; Yale University's investment office asked its money managers to examine how its investments affect climate&nbsp;change and to look into avoiding companies that do not take sensible ''steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.'' The announcement did not satisfy students pressing for divestment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitzer College, however, is one of a number of schools that have promised more extensive efforts to remove fossil fuels from their endowments. Donald P. Gould, a trustee and chair of the Pitzer investment committee and president of Gould Asset Management, said that everyone involved in the decision knew that the direct and immediate effect on the companies would be minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think that anyone who favors divestment is arguing that the institutions' sale of the fossil fuel company stock is going to have much impact, if any, on either the stocks or the companies themselves,'' he said, since the market capitalizations of the companies is immense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the movement were to depress share prices, the energy companies, which make enormous profits from their products, do not need to go to capital markets to raise money, he noted. But in the long term, he said, ''divestment seeks to work indirectly on these companies by changing the conversation about the climate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pension funds have proved a harder sell. While Hesta Australia, a health care industry retirement fund worth $26 billion, announced last week that it would get out of coal, many others have not. PensionDanmark said in a statement that it has invested 7 percent of its $26 billion portfolio in renewable energy with plans to raise that percentage over time. ''Divestment will itself not contribute to solving the challenges of global climate&nbsp;change, and we believe it is not a very wise way to try and solve the issue,'' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torben Moger Pedersen, the fund's chief executive, added that if the returns from a traditional carbon-based power plant and a wind farm were equal, the fund would invest in the wind farm. But, he added, ''We are not missionaries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last week at the Rockefeller family's longtime New York offices at 30 Rockefeller Center, Mr. Heintz, Mr. Rockefeller and Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, the chairwoman of the fund, spoke of the family's longstanding commitment to use the fund to advance environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family has also engaged in shareholder activism with Exxon Mobil, the largest successor to Standard Oil. Members have met privately with the company over the years in efforts to get it to moderate its stance on issues pertaining to the environment and climate&nbsp;change. They acknowledged that they have not caused the company to greatly alter its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rockefellers have also tried to spur change through direct investment. In the 1980s, Mr. Rockefeller said, members of the family formed a $2 million fund to invest directly in renewable-energy alternatives. They were too early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The fund didn't survive, which was a lesson,'' he said. Nevertheless, he added, the failure of the fund was ''a badge of honor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Wayne said the family's commitment is intergenerational, and continuing. She said that her 8-year-old daughter lectures her on the destruction of orangutan habitat to create palm oil plantations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If I'm wearing lipstick, she won't kiss me,'' she said, ''because there's palm oil in it.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW HAVEN -- WORLD leaders are at the United Nations this week, at the invitation of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, to ''champion an ambitious vision anchored in action that will enable a meaningful global agreement'' on climate&nbsp;change next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if history is any guide, the dialogue is unlikely to produce the ramped-up response we need to address the many threats we face from the unrelenting buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Government leaders have gathered multiple times over the past several decades to address climate&nbsp;change, most recently in 2009 in Copenhagen, where negotiators tried, but failed, to ''seal the deal'' with a new commitment to reduce emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years later, given the difficult geopolitics, there is little to show for it. Perhaps the world community should take a different approach before the next round of talks, in Paris in December 2015, ends with another Copenhagen-style outcome with minimal results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smart people in the 20th century thought we could tackle climate&nbsp;change with a treaty in which the world's nations agreed to ''targets and timetables'' for reducing emissions. These reductions would be implemented by top-down, national mandates and government support for clean energy technologies. But 22 years after the original climate agreement, emissions continue to rise and threats of significant harm loom larger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of those who, as an official at the Environmental Protection Agency, negotiated that first United Nations treaty in 1992, I believe we need to shift gears and try something new. Relying on national governments alone to deliver results is not enough, as the last two decades have shown. The real action on climate&nbsp;change around the world is coming from governors, mayors, corporate chief executives and community leaders. They are the ones best positioned to make change happen on the ground. Accordingly, we need to move from a top-down strategy to a bottom-up approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayors in Barcelona, Melbourne and the Brazilian city of Curitiba, for instance, are trying to expand public transportation. New York City's former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg worked with pipeline companies to increase natural gas access so residents could shift from dirty fuel oil furnaces to cheaper and cleaner natural gas ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Columbia and Quebec have introduced cap-and-trade programs that put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, making it more expensive to pollute and encouraging innovation. California has done the same thing. So have nine states in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Connecticut, where I served as commissioner of energy and environmental protection, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, has begun a ''green bank'' that uses limited government money to leverage vastly increased flows of private capital for clean energy projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These efforts show that the quest for a clean energy future can be pursued in a serious, cost-effective and bipartisan manner without the impetus or imprimatur of national governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders in many industries have also stepped up, seeing sustainability as good for their bottom line. Unilever's food divisions, for instance, have encouraged their supplier-farmers to adopt efficiency advances and lower-carbon production methods. Dow Chemical has developed a filtration system that reduces the energy used to purify water by 30 percent. Alcoa has helped Boeing and Ford achieve better fuel efficiency by reducing the weight of their planes and cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These corporate successes and many more should be highlighted when world leaders gather in Paris to negotiate the next round of climate commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More fundamentally, why not invite leaders from states, provinces, cities and companies to join representatives of national governments in signing the anticipated 2015 climate&nbsp;change agreement? Sure, the focus of international relations for hundreds of years has been on nation-states, but there is no reason this has to be so. We should recalibrate our approach to engage local, regional and corporate leaders, especially on issues like climate&nbsp;change that require broad-based public support if we are to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while we're at it, let's shift away from the top-down way that the federal government subsidizes clean energy innovations, which relies on picking winners and assisting chosen industries and technologies. Instead, let's promote a financing approach in which the government works to engage the private sector in delivering clean energy projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can be done with green banks and bonds and other private-sector clean energy finance mechanisms that could drastically increase the flow of capital into energy efficiency and renewable power. A private-market emphasis offers the prospect of not just more money and better projects, but also competition to lower costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that the present approach isn't working will be hard for some. But let's hope this week's gathering starts us down a new path.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legions of demonstrators frustrated by international inaction on global warming descended on New York City on Sunday, marching through the heart of Manhattan with a message of alarm for world leaders set to gather this week at the United Nations for a summit meeting on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coursing through Midtown, from Columbus Circle to Times Square and the Far West Side, the People's Climate March was a spectacle even for a city known for doing things big, and it was joined, in solidarity, by demonstrations on Sunday across the globe, from Paris to Papua New Guinea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm here because I really feel that every major social movement in this country has come when people get together,'' said Carol Sutton of Norwalk, Conn., the president of a teachers' union. ''It begins in the streets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the scientists holding an oversize chalkboard to the Hurricane Sandy victims toting life preservers, the march was a self-consciously inclusive affair, with the organizers intent on creating a very big tent, which they hoped would hammer home the relevance of climate&nbsp;change and its effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march attracted leading lights in the environmental movement, most notably former Vice President Al Gore. It drew the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, who will preside over this week's United Nations climate summit meeting. And it included Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, fresh off his announcement that he was committing the city to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was mostly an event for concerned ordinary people, many of them veterans of climate&nbsp;change efforts, others relative newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From as close as the Bronx and as far as at least Rome, the demonstrators came in vast numbers. At one point early in the afternoon, the march came to a halt because the entire 2.2-mile route was full, and more than two hours into the procession, people were still setting out from the starting point near Columbus Circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers, using data provided by 35 crowd spotters and analyzed by a mathematician from Carnegie Mellon University, estimated that 311,000 people marched the route.The signs that marchers held were as varied as the movement: ''There Is No Planet B,'' ''Forests Not for Sale'' and ''Jobs, Justice, Clean Energy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diversity of the demonstrators made for some odd juxtapositions. On West 58th Street, the minaret of an inflatable mosque bobbed next to a wooden replica of Noah's Ark the size of a school bus. Nearby, Capuchin Franciscan monks in flowing brown robes, who were in town from Rome for the march, mingled with nuns, while a group flying a pagan flag beat a drum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climax of the march came in the early afternoon. All along the route, crowds had been quieted for a moment of silence. On Avenue of the Americas at 57th Street, there was an eerie silence as marchers raised their arms and looked down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then at exactly 1 p.m., a whistle pierced the silence, setting off a minute-long cacophony intended as a collective alarm on climate&nbsp;change. There were the beats of the drums and the blaring of horns, but mostly it was whoops and cries of the marchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key organizers of the event, the international advocacy group Avaaz, presented a petition with more than 2.1 million signatures demanding action on climate&nbsp;change. ''It's a testament to how powerful this movement is,'' Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, said. ''People are coming in amazing numbers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the march, the summit meeting on Tuesday at the United Nations will be flush with speeches intended to build support for addressing climate&nbsp;change. But the gathering of world leaders is not meant to be a formal negotiating session for a potential 2015 agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, though, the real work toward forging a global deal was underway. A few blocks from the march, in a hotel conference room on Lexington Avenue, Secretary of State John Kerry convened a meeting of foreign ministers of the 17-member Major Economies Forum, focused on climate&nbsp;change, and Todd Stern, the chief United States climate&nbsp;change negotiator, held back-to-back meetings throughout the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry said he intended to keep a focus on climate&nbsp;change throughout the week, despite the pressure of other crises, including insurgent terrorists in Iraq and the Ebola outbreak in Africa. ''The grave threat that climate&nbsp;change poses warrants a prominent position on that list,'' he told reporters. ''Those are immediate. But this has even greater, longer-term consequences that can cost hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars, and lives, and the security of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that this summer -- the months of June, July and August -- was the hottest on record for the globe, and that 2014 was on track to break the record for the hottest year, set in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was concern about the consequences of that warming that drew people to the march, organized by a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, and that inspired some of the event's most sober and most outrageous expressions, some of them not even on the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of the Flatiron Building, on Fifth Avenue, a 3,000-pound ice sculpture spelled out ''The Future.'' Dripping onto the sidewalk, it had been carved over two days in Queens by a group of Japanese ice sculptors. ''I would say we are melting down the future,'' said Nora Ligorano, one of the artists who conceived the work. ''It's a comment on what we are doing to the planet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Columbus Circle, there were bare-breasted women and people with dreadlocks and homespun clothing. There were Muslim women wearing hijabs and groups of older women with signs proclaiming they were ''Grandmas Against Global Warming.'' and that ''Gray Is Green.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two high school seniors from Long Island, Kirsten Cunha and Alexandra Dos Santos, both 17, marched with dust masks over their mouths. ''Wearing masks like this could quite possibly be our children's future,'' Ms. Dos Santos said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;What can be done to address climate change, as individuals, community members and global citizens? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have probably heard or read about, or perhaps participated in, one of the 2,700 climate&nbsp;change-related events that took place around the world on Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To what degree did these events raise your awareness about climate&nbsp;change? Do you worry about this or other environmental issues? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the article &quot;Scientists Report Global Rise in Greenhouse Gas Emissions,&quot; Justin Gillis writes about the report released on Sunday that shows 2013 as the year global emissions of greenhouse gases reached record levels:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new numbers, reported by a tracking initiative called the Global Carbon Project and published in the journal Nature Geoscience, came on the eve of a United Nations summit meeting meant to harness fresh political ambition in tackling climate&nbsp;change. Scientists said the figures showed that vastly greater efforts would be needed to get long-term global warming within tolerable limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet expectations for the summit meeting on Tuesday are low, with no sign of any political breakthrough that would lead to more ambitious efforts. Scientists say emissions must peak within the next few years, and then begin to decline, if the world is to have any hope of keeping global warming to an upper limit that countries agreed on five years ago. So far, no plans are in place that would come close to achieving that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissions have been falling gradually in recent years in most of the developed countries, in part because of economic weakness but also because of strengthening climate policies. Emissions in the 28-nation European Union fell 1.8 percent in 2013, despite increases in coal consumption in a few countries, including Germany and Poland. Emissions decreased sharply in Britain, Italy and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States emissions had been declining because of increased burning of natural gas in power generation, which emits less carbon dioxide for each unit of energy than does coal. But the nation reported an increase in 2013 as coal regained some market share. If that trend continues, it could prove to be a challenge for the Obama administration as it seeks to institute tighter policies on greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... In a separate report in early September, the World Meteorological Organization said the level of carbon dioxide in the air in 2013 was 42 percent above the level that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution. Other important greenhouse gases have gone up as well, with methane increasing 153 percent from the preindustrial level and nitrous oxide by 21 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase of these and other gases from human activity has caused the planet to warm by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the preindustrial era, which is causing land ice to melt all over the world. The oceans are rising at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and heat waves and torrential rains are intensifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nations of the world have agreed to try to limit the warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which would require that emissions slow down and then largely stop in the next 30 years or so. If they continue on their present course through the century, scientists say, the earth could warm by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit above the preindustrial level, which would likely be incompatible with human civilization in its current form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations secretary general, will open the international Climate Summit and the 69th session of the General Assembly this week with some of the most difficult challenges of his tenure dominating the agenda including Ebola and ethnic violence around the world that is driving populations from their homes. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday at the United Nations, the first world conference on indigenous peoples will begin, a day before the Climate Summit opens and world leaders begin to gather for the 69th session of the General Assembly. It will be an important week for the United Nations, and for Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, who will speak before the Climate Summit and open the General Assembly meeting with a speech on Wednesday.   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What should you listen for? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no dearth of crises that haunt the United Nations' boss. Syria has been at war for three years and counting, prompting an unprecedented refugee crisis across the Middle East, and the conflict is now convulsing Iraq.  Since the last session of the General Assembly, Mr. Ban has had to confront full-blown ethnic conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Gaza lies in ruins after this summer's war there, and so, too, the prospects for a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has prompted a wave of displacement and even compelled the United Nations to send food aid to Europe for the first time in 20 years. Mr. Ban told reporters last week that he would use his bully pulpit at the General Assembly to &quot;call on world leaders to unite and uphold human dignity, the rule of law and the principles of the United Nations Charter.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What will he try to highlight?He is trying to revive attention to climate&nbsp;change, which is overshadowed by the various peace and security crises on the agenda. Although world leaders have until next year to come to an agreement, Mr. Ban will likely use his speech at Tuesday's Climate Summit to goad rich countries to commit to specific targets on cutting emissions and to put up money for poor countries to deal with climate&nbsp;change.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, he will use his General Assembly address to remind the world of what they have been able to achieve: Member states are close to meeting several of Millennium Development Goalson things like eradicating extreme poverty and reducing maternal mortality. Members will have to wrestle next year on a new set of goals, including whether to tackle growing inequality worldwide, in rich and poor countries alike.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's his biggest test? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola. It is spreading rapidly in one of the most fragile, war-torn parts of the planet, in West Africa. It is also precisely the kind of crisis that the United Nations should be good at tackling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban has already tried to make the case that every country can help, whether by sending hazmat suits or helicopters to the affected countries. He has established an emergency mission to coordinate the world response to the Ebola outbreak. He is still trying to persuade countries to airlift and treat aid workers affected by the virus. Getting Ebola under control soon will be crucial to his legacy.                      </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;Change is a huge topic and embraces so many changes facing our planet due to irresponsible human activity. Our oceans are the heart and lungs of our planet and face serious crisis that will potentially eradicate all life as we know it. What specifically will the United Nations General Assembly do to address our most important marine challenges and make our oceans a No. 1 priority?- Reader question </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format of this United Nations climate conference is that dozens of heads of state will speak Tuesday, for four minutes apiece. At this point we don't know what they will say. It's certainly possible that some announcements will be made on ocean policy, particularly on expanding zones called marine protected areas, which is a big trend around the world right now. But I have to say that ocean policy has tended to get short shrift in almost all the United Nations climate talks, so I would not be wildly optimistic that we will hear much of substance on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1 p.m. on Sunday, tens of thousands of demonstrators in Manhattan are expected to make as much noise as they can -- with whistles, trumpets, even the tolling of church bells -- to raise an alarm about the risks of climate&nbsp;change. Similar demonstrations are planned across the United States and in 161 other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, that show of unity will most likely give way to political discord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations is convening on Tuesday the largest gathering of world leaders ever devoted to climate&nbsp;change, and some bold proclamations are expected. Africa will promise a clean-energy corridor stretching from Cairo to Cape Town. Pledges will be made to halve the destruction of the world's forests by 2020 and stop it by 2030. The World Bank will lead a big push to put a global price on emissions of greenhouse gases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as they seek to build momentum for a new global deal on climate&nbsp;change by 2015, the 126 heads of state in attendance are likely to find themselves plagued by an old divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If history is any guide, the rich countries of the world will say how concerned they are about the damage their emissions of heat-trapping gases are causing. The poor countries -- whose people have done little to contribute to global warming but stand to suffer the most from it because of their vulnerability to rising seas and weather extremes -- will point out that this professed concern never seems to translate into sufficient action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're saying to the U.S. and the developed world, 'You're responsible for this,' '' said Ronald Jean Jumeau -- the ambassador to the United Nations for the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles, off the coast of Africa -- in a preview of his country's remarks. ''Don't tell us you can't cut emissions, you can't give money, while you bask in the rich way of life you enjoy now. You know your emissions are damaging us. Help us out here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People like Mr. Jumeau have been pleading for help for years, and they have heard many promises that help will come. The latest attempt to make good on those pledges is the Green Climate Fund, a financing vehicle that is eventually supposed to funnel as much as $100 billion a year to poor countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund, which struggled for four years to get off the ground and opened its doors only recently, has received just one large donation to date: $1 billion from Germany. More are expected this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of the low expectations for the United Nations summit, though, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany plans to skip it, as do some of the world's other important leaders, most notably Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, and Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is expected to attend, and he will be able to say that his administration is pursuing serious cuts in American emissions, with a plan under development by the Environmental Protection Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are taking this summit seriously,'' John D. Podesta, a counselor to Mr. Obama, said in a briefing late last week. The president, he said, seeks ''to show the world that the U.S. is taking the climate&nbsp;change fight seriously, and to call on other leaders to step up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Podesta said the president would announce new measures to help the most vulnerable countries, though he did not give specifics or dollar figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, being held in New York, was called by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, as a prelude to 15 months of negotiations that are supposed to culminate in a new international climate agreement. The agreement is to be ratified in Paris in late 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is meant to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which proved ineffective at slowing global warming, partly because Congress balked at it and partly because it exempted developing countries from taking serious action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new negotiations will take place against a backdrop of increasingly urgent warnings from scientists, who have published a string of reports over the past year saying that climate&nbsp;change is already causing serious problems, and that they are likely to get much worse if emissions continue at a runaway pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the starkest divide in these talks is between rich and poor countries, it is the countries in the middle that may hold the key to a breakthrough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China was once counted as a poor country, but its rapid economic growth has made it the world's largest single emitter of greenhouse gases in recent years. Developing countries are now responsible for two-thirds of the world's emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means, in effect, that it is no longer possible to get global warming under control without serious action by China and other middle-income countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese seem more willing than in the past, based on recent public discussions, to entertain ambitious climate goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, for instance, a Chinese official said that by 2016, the country would roll out a national cap on emissions of carbon dioxide and issue pollution permits under the cap that could be traded in a marketplace. It is already testing such a ''cap and trade'' approach in seven regional markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of any announcements China and the United States make on Tuesday, it may not become clear until the spring how much the two countries are really willing to do to secure a deal in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiators have called for governments to put forward plans by April 1 detailing how much they will cut emissions starting in 2020, and the American and Chinese governments are both drafting such plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration envisions making a deal in Paris that it does not have to take to Congress for ratification, which would inevitably mean a document weaker than a treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two years, Mr. Obama and his aides have essentially been begging the American people to make them do more. Their logic seems to be that only popular protest can overcome the resistance in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We need a grass-roots movement,'' Secretary of State John Kerry, a longtime advocate of climate action, told television interviewers last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen if Sunday's march in New York will be large enough to get the attention of politicians. In the meantime, poor countries around the world are still waiting for the help they have been promised. Island nations whose people have nowhere to go are watching in fear as the oceans rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have been telling the world that for us, climate&nbsp;change is not a distant threat,'' said Tony A. deBrum, foreign affairs minister of the Marshall Islands, a Pacific nation of 50,000 people that has been dealing with drought and severe tidal flooding over the past year. ''Life is quickly becoming like living in a war zone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the populous countries playing their cards close to the vest, much of the attention at the summit will go to announcements of climate action by smaller countries, private companies and coalitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example is a ramped-up effort to halt the destruction of the world's tropical forests over the next 15 years, with money flowing from rich countries to poorer ones to finance preservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another expected announcement is a proposed energy corridor that is supposed to stretch the length of the African continent, with power lines linking major cities to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specifics have not been worked out, and little money has been committed so far, but the project does seem to be gathering momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The antipoverty group Oxfam, which has often been skeptical of promises on climate&nbsp;change, said in a report last week that the initiative had ''the potential to avoid future emissions by helping the continent leapfrog fossil fuels and move straight to renewables.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- ON Tuesday, world leaders will converge at United Nations headquarters in New York for a summit meeting on the climate that will set the stage for global negotiations next year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the threat of global climate&nbsp;change. The summit is titled ''Catalyzing Action,'' a decidedly hopeful characterization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I were so hopeful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that, in theory, we can avoid the worst consequences of climate&nbsp;change with an intensive global effort over the next several decades. But given real-world economic and, in particular, political realities, that seems unlikely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are emerging hints of a positive path ahead, but first let's look at the sobering reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is now on track to more than double current greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere by the end of the century. This would push up average global temperatures by three to eight degrees Celsius and could mean the disappearance of glaciers, droughts in the mid-to-low latitudes, decreased crop productivity, increased sea levels and flooding, vanishing islands and coastal wetlands, greater storm frequency and intensity, the risk of species extinction and a significant spread of infectious disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has set a goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by no more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. (The average global temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1880, with two-thirds of the warming occurring since 1975.) Meeting this goal would require a worldwide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 to 70 percent by midcentury, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change. That's an immense challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that 300 years of economic growth in the industrialized countries have been fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels -- coal, petroleum and natural gas. We still depend on these. And the large emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and South Africa are rapidly putting in place new infrastructure that is also dependent on burning fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two points are important to understand if we're going to be serious about attacking this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, it will be costly. An economic assessment might be ''difficult, but not impossible.'' And two, things become more challenging when we move from the economics to the politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing what is necessary to achieve the United Nations' target for reducing emissions would reduce economic growth by about 0.06 percent annually from now through 2100, according to the I.P.C.C. That sounds trivial, but by the end of the century it means a 5 percent loss of worldwide economic activity per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this cost projection assumes optimal conditions -- the immediate implementation of a common global price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions, a significant expansion of nuclear power and the advent and wide use of new, low-cost technologies to control emissions and provide cleaner sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the new technologies we hope will be available aren't, like one that would enable the capture and storage of carbon emissions from power plants, the cost estimates more than double.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the politics, which are driven by two fundamental facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, greenhouse gases mix globally in the atmosphere, and so damages are spread around the world, regardless of where the gases were emitted. Thus, any country taking action incurs the costs, but the benefits are distributed globally. This presents a classic free-rider problem: It is in the economic self-interest of virtually no country to take unilateral action, and each can reap the benefits of any countries that do act. This is why international cooperation is essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, some of these heat-trapping gases -- in particular, carbon dioxide -- remain in the atmosphere for centuries, so even if we were to rapidly reduce emissions, the problem would not be solved immediately. Even the most aggressive efforts will take time to ramp up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These realities -- the global nature and persistence of the problem -- present fundamental geopolitical challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing greenhouse gas pollution will require the unalloyed cooperation of at least the 15 countries and one region (the European Union) that together account for about 80 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. This will mean resolving deep divisions between industrialized nations and developing countries, which argue they should be able to build their economies, just as the West did, without having to reduce or slow the growth of their emissions. This dispute has prevented progress internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, the issue is mired in partisan politics, and the outlook is not promising for an effective national climate policy that would encourage carbon-friendly innovation and cost-effective emission reductions by putting a price on carbon emissions -- either by taxing them or using a national cap-and-trade system that would make it more expensive to pollute. Rather than rewarding today's voters with benefits financed by future generations, as Congress typically does, solving the climate problem will require costly actions now to protect those who will follow us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making matters more difficult, climate&nbsp;change is essentially unobservable by the public. On a daily basis, we observe the weather, not the climate. This makes it less likely that public opinion will force action the way it did 50 years ago when black smoke rose from industrial smokestacks, and chemicals and raw sewage were dumped untreated into rivers, famously causing one to catch fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, in China, which leads the world in carbon emissions at 29 percent of the total, the prospect in the near term for a meaningful climate policy appears dim, because of the country's predominant focus on economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China may achieve its goal of reducing the carbon intensity of its economy (the ratio of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of output) by 45 percent below its 2005 level by 2020. But the country is growing so fast that its coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to increase. China is expected to add the equivalent of a new 500-megawatt coal-fired electric plant every 10 days for the next decade, according to projections by the United States government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute between the developing and developed world over carbon-emissions reductions has its roots in a series of international agreements in the 1990s, when the industrialized nations alone, but not the large emerging economies, agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, since 1990, emissions have been flat or declining in the industrialized world, while increasing rapidly in the large, emerging economies, particularly China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of current United Nations efforts to develop a promising new approach that would require emissions reductions by all nations, most countries in the developing world continue to insist that these reductions should be made only by industrialized countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these obstacles, a developing convergence of interests of the two key emitting countries -- China and the United States -- offers hope for progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While America's annual emissions in 1990 were almost twice the level of Chinese emissions, by 2006 China had overtaken the United States. And China will surpass the United States as the top cumulative global emitter of carbon dioxide over the coming decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government is deeply concerned about worsening local air pollution, which contributed to an estimated 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010. Most actions to improve local air quality will also curb carbon dioxide emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries are moving forward with regional, market-based programs to reduce emissions. China expects to link its local and regional cap-and-trade programs together in a nationwide system. In the United States, the failure in 2009 of a meaningful carbon-pricing policy in Congress led the Obama administration to turn to regulatory action, including its June announcement of carbon dioxide regulations for existing power plants, which are likely to be met in many states through cap-and-trade systems. The linkage of such systems both within countries and across international borders holds promise as an environmentally effective and cost-effective approach to reducing emissions in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the 20th century was the American Century, then leaders in China anticipate (or at least hope) that the 21st century will be the Chinese Century, one of global leadership, not obstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the political climate in the United States presents its own challenges. It will require immense effort -- and profound good fortune -- to find political openings that can resolve the debilitating partisan divide on climate&nbsp;change. But if destructive politics have been at the heart of the problem, the best hope may be that creative politics and leadership can help provide a solution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sweeping effort to reduce its environmental impact, New York City is planning to overhaul the energy-efficiency standards of all its public buildings and to pressure private landlords to make similar improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative is part of a pledge, to be announced before the start of the United Nations Climate Summit on Tuesday, to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels. The United Nations has pointed to that rate of decrease as a desired target for developed countries to mitigate the effects of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York would become the largest city in the world to make the commitment, according to the city's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the proposal is likely to rankle some residential and commercial building owners, who will bear a portion of its cost, officials have framed the issue in part as an extension of the citywide focus on income inequality since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in January. High energy costs, the de Blasio administration argues, amount to a regressive tax, because lower-income residents by and large pay a higher share of their rent for energy than wealthier residents, and often live in less-efficient buildings. The long-term savings could prove to be a financial boost for lower-income residents, officials said -- to say nothing of the environmental benefits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such ambitions, though, will come at a significant near-term price: At least $1 billion of its capital funding alone will be devoted to enhancing the city-owned buildings over the next decade, the administration said, excluding the cost of the private building alterations and other changes. Though the city's many competing financial interests mean there are typically few spending guarantees, particularly on projects intended to span decades, officials insist the money will be incorporated in its 10-year capital plan, to be released early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Global warming was much more of an abstraction to New York City until two years ago,'' Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on Friday, alluding to Hurricane Sandy, which in 2012 caused 44 deaths and resulted in $19 billion of damage to the city. ''There's a moral imperative to act.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with a global audience looking toward New York this week, as world leaders including President Obama converge to discuss climate&nbsp;change, Mr. de Blasio is training attention not just on its waterfront but on its skyline: The city -- dense and walkable, with an extensive subway system -- has long been more environmentally friendly than most. As a result, nearly three-quarters of emissions come from energy used in buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible upgrades will range from changes like lighting or boiler improvements to solar-power installations and the introduction of an ''air conditioner exchange program'' in public housing, where the units tend to be older and less efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures are intended to help the city take a significant step toward a ''complete transition away from fossil fuels,'' according to a 111-page draft report on the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, the city said, building-based greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall an additional 10 percent by 2025, the equivalent of removing more than 700,000 vehicles from the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last several years, and particularly since Hurricane Sandy, the city has aimed to protect itself better from extreme weather. Months before leaving office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, proposed a $20 billion storm protection plan for a sprawling network of flood walls, levees and bulkheads, among other initiatives -- a vision that Mr. de Blasio has largely moved to adopt and expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boston, San Francisco and Stockholm are among cities that have made similar commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, who plans to participate in the People's Climate March in Manhattan on Sunday, predicted his program would prompt other cities to follow. ''We know when New York City acts, it helps move policy in other places,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration said it could complete many of the changes unilaterally; others will require support from the City Council, which unveiled a related package of legislation on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early months of Mr. de Blasio's term, he faced modest criticism from some environmental advocates, who suggested he had not provided enough details on his climate plans, and for not yet naming a permanent leader for the city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But groups briefed on the plan on Friday gave it generally high marks. Donna DeCostanzo of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the package of building changes ''could be the most far-reaching one of its kind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others pointed to the potential cost reductions. By 2025, according to the city's estimates, the upgrades will yield more than $1.4 billion per year in savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The de Blasio administration also plans to expand an existing mandate requiring buildings over 50,000 square feet to track and disclose energy use annually and upgrade lighting. Under the change, any building larger than 25,000 square feet would be subject to the requirements, bringing as many as 16,000 buildings in the five boroughs under the mandate for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building on programs adopted by the state -- which in 2009 set its own goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 from 1990 levels -- city officials will also offer grants and other incentives to owners. As part of a ''green grant program'' for affordable housing, officials said, the city will pay for efficiency upgrades if owners agree to preserve lower-cost units in a given building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though some landlords seem likely to resist the changes without legal prodding, the city's push earned praise from the leader of the powerful Real Estate Board of New York. Rob Speyer, the board's chairman, said in a statement that the mayor's goals of increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions would ''help solidify New York's standing as the world's model of sustainability.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials said many New York real estate owners had already embraced ''green'' buildings, citing their operational savings and attractiveness to some high-end renters. Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, said many owners were ''already doing some of these things for pure economic reasons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city would not say when a more aggressive mandate might be applied if owners failed to adopt the necessary changes on their own. Mr. de Blasio said there was ''a growing understanding in the private sector that this is everyone's problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we don't see progress,'' he added, ''we will certainly move to mandate.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years ago, Richard Branson, the tie-loathing adventurer (as his Twitter feed has it) and figurehead of Virgin Atlantic airlines, Virgin Galactic space travel and so on, pledged to invest around $3bn (&pound;1.85bn) in green technologies by 2016. A $25m investment went into the Virgin Earth Challenge, a prize for inventing something to suck up all the planet-wrecking carbon emitted by gas-guzzling industries like his own. Some goes into developing low-carbon fuels. Some pays for the snazzy Carbon War Room, a sort of green-tech Dragons' Den. &quot;Gaia capitalism&quot;, Branson has called his vision. &quot;We have to make it a win-win for all concerned.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That 2016 deadline is fast approaching. How much, Naomi Klein asked Branson, will he have put into his pledge by then? &quot;I suspect it will be less than $1bn right now,&quot; he confessed. He has been busy elsewhere in the meantime, launching Virgin America airlines, V Australia airlines, Virgin Atlantic Little Red airlines, and investing heavily in Virgin Galactic, perhaps because - as he has started saying - he has a plan to move to Mars. Klein doesn't necessarily follow the people who see Branson's green shenanigans as &quot;a cynical ploy&quot; to build his brand and confuse his critics. But you can grant him his good intentions and still think all this greenwash doesn't make a lot of sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no doubt that climate&nbsp;change is happening; it has already started wreaking damage, and is set to do much more. Temperatures have risen by nearly 1C since the industrial revolution, and in 2012 the World Bank predicted a rise of 4C by 2100, bringing &quot;extreme heat waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity and life-threatening sea-level rise&quot;. And yet coordinated international response is missing. The 2009 Copenhagen climate summit settled for a half-hearted 2C target, then failed to secure commitment even on that. Obama seems stuck, as the US fracks and drills its heart out and Canada tears up Alberta in the race for tar. Climate, politics and business are caught in a vicious triangle, and at the moment it's the climate that is getting squeezed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to resolve this is with tough, fair, world-level regulation. But instead we have a vacuum, into which pours all manner of noxious nonsense. Climate-change deniers, luxuriantly astroturfed. Charities cosying up to fossil-fuel interests, including one, Klein has discovered, that has put oil and gas wells on its own bird reserve. Clever chaps who should know better - Stephen Hawking, the lads from Freakonomics - with their fantasies of terraforms and geo-engineering. Eddying little markets in non-solutions: carbon offsets, emissions trading, organic nappies. What's wrong with us that we've let this happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein argues that humans don't cause climate collapse, and nor does carbon. The problem is a particular arrangement of these elements - in other words, capitalism, the whole point of which is to find resources and exploit them. It's a habit of mind, if you like, a form of behaviour. As such, it can be changed. Except that most of the time we cannot see this, because we are &quot;locked in, politically, physically and culturally&quot; to the world that capital has made. &quot;We lack the collective spaces in which to confront the raw terror of ecocide,&quot; is how Klein encapsulates the problem. Lucky for everybody then that opening up such spaces is exactly what Klein does best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll never forget the interview with her in the Guardian after the publication of her first book, No Logo (1999). So quietly and sensibly you scarcely noticed, she completely shifted the terms of the anti-corporate argument, and the one about what politics in the 21st century is for. On her own development, from shopping addict to activist-intellectual: &quot;The only way I got consumerism and vanity into a sane place in my life . . . was by becoming interested in other things.&quot; On why she won't judge you if your shoes were made in a sweatshop. &quot;This is not a consumer issue, it's a political issue . . . Products are just stuff.&quot; Shopping or not shopping is neither here nor there: politics is about law and democratic structures. If politicians aren't doing what people think they should be doing, it's up to those people to find a way of getting them to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, as The Shock Doctrine (2007) made plain, Klein also knows that what she's up against is extreme. Capital has learned lots recently about using disaster as a cash cow, from Katrina to Baghdad. &quot;And there are plenty of signs that climate&nbsp;change will be no exception&quot; is how she starts this book. Her task is to take a potential catastrophe of unimaginable reach and to be calm and welcoming, drawing new people in. She does vast amounts of travel and research and thinking, then crafts all of it to the scale of her own voice: the voice of a pleasant, funny, unthreatening-looking woman with layerings and lowlights, a husband and a baby, living in Toronto in what US Vogue, in its current issue, calls &quot;a middle-class brick home&quot;. (You can access the Vogue piece from Klein's website, and it's worth reading. As are what Klein calls her &quot;two issues&quot; with it: that they mentioned her recent treatment for thyroid cancer, &quot;not a subject I would have chosen to be public about&quot;, and that a promise was broken not to identify the brand of shirt she's wearing in the pictures - &quot;Lots of people make nice white shirts.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital, Klein argues, has been separating humans from the world around them since the discovery of steam. But it is what she calls &quot;our great collective misfortune&quot; that just as leaders started waking up to the emissions problem in the early 1990s, they were also establishing the World Trade Organisation, and with it, a &quot;new era&quot; of hyperactive deregulation, tax-cutting and privatisation of public space. When historians look back, as Klein says, they'll see the two processes in parallel, each pretending not to know about the other: the climate movement, &quot;struggling, sputtering, failing utterly&quot; and corporate globalisation, &quot;zooming from victory to victory&quot;. The climate movement needs to think harder about capital, if it is to have a chance of getting real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's difficult to spot climate&nbsp;change as it happens, because it moves so spasmodically and is by its nature &quot;place-based&quot;. What do I know about the mines of Nauru or gas flares on the Niger Delta? What can I do about flooding in the Maldives or New Orleans? &quot;Sacrifice zones&quot; is what Klein chillingly calls the places most depredated: &quot;Poor places. Out-of-the-way places. Places where residents lack political power, usually having to do with some combination of race, language and class.&quot; But even in the rich world, most people don't notice the dwindling of nature in their parks and gardens; or if they do, they are so sickened, they have to stop noticing right away. Which is why Klein sees the living wage as a climate issue. The main reason so many people are so careless is because they are worn out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her own eureka moment came, in 2009, she writes, over lunch with the Bolivian diplomat Angelica Navarro Llanos. &quot;Using chopsticks as props,&quot; Navarro Llanos explained how tough international climate action might mobilise what she called &quot;a Marshall Plan for the Earth&quot;. For the first time, Klein saw that climate&nbsp;change is not an abstract, sciencey matter, and that it's far too important to be left to the knit-your-owns. Her proposals for what she calls &quot;a politics based on reconnection&quot; involve real, ordinary, active humans, working in properly modern, complex societies. Green industries, such as renewable energy and public transport, are all much more labour-intensive than their fossil-fuel equivalents. &quot;Climate action is in fact a massive job creator as well as a community builder and source of hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein hopes this book will be read by people who don't read climate-change books (such as me). So it's probably my duty to warn you that it is quite wordy, and sees things from a North American angle, and is a bit more vague about renewable energy than I'd like. But so what - it's an unavoidably difficult and complex subject. The argument is signposted throughout with striking buzzwords: Extractivism, Big Green, No Messiahs, Blockadia. Not to mention the brilliant title - an executive summary in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's one especially good bit, that completely stopped me dead. If you follow the climate science, you'll have heard the talk about how change doesn't happen incrementally but touches sudden &quot;non-linear tipping elements&quot;, which may at any moment run completely out of control. Well, Klein also discusses a paper called &quot;Is Earth Fucked?&quot; by the geophysicist Brad Werner, which models the likely progress of &quot;earth-human systems&quot; towards various unpleasant outcomes, unless one remaining node of unpredictability is activated: &quot;people or groups of people&quot; who resist. Klein has timed her book to come out the week before the 2014 UN climate summit opens in New York City, and is on the board of 350.org, the group planning the People's Climate March that will greet it. We can only wish her and her fellow campaigners all the very best.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Workers Arts Coalition, a group of union members and artists, gathered to plan their float for the People's Climate March this Sunday, they had no shortage of design ideas: A sculpture of a human body decorated with different ecosystems? A performance piece with union guys singing in light-up vests? There was a robot, of course, said Jaime Lopez, an electrician and a founder of the group. ''A 'Climatron,' '' Mr. Lopez said, ''built out with all kinds of awesome weapons, fighting climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, they settled on a simpler but still grand vision. ''We're going to make our own little city,'' Mr. Lopez, 28, said, ''using different elements of green power.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Made of sheet metal -- courtesy of Local 28, a sheet metal workers' union, and others -- their float has a mini-Empire State Building, a mini-Chrysler Building and a mini-Freedom Tower. A model of the Brooklyn Bridge has a sign with W.P.A.-era lettering, ''We Build the Future,'' on a green sunburst background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message, said Bobby Andrew, a member of Local 28, is one of confidence. Organized labor is already ''using green technology,'' said Mr. Andrew, 54. The float will be pulled by a biodiesel truck, with its lights powered by workers on bicycles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those planning to participate in the march on Sunday, which its promoters are calling the world's largest action against climate&nbsp;change, much of the building and fine-tuning has come in just these last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the floats narratively accessible and visually appealing -- not to mention carbon-neutral -- has been a challenge. ''This is the hardest issue I've ever worked on,'' said Raquel de Anda, an organizer and a gallery curator, whose task was to recruit diverse artists for the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She approached Ra&uacute;l Ayala, a Brooklyn muralist and member of Ropavejeros, a collective of Latin American immigrant artists, to create a piece about immigration and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ayala, 34, and the six other members of his group, who hail from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Mexico, and who met working on construction sites around the city, came up with an allegorical float. The centerpiece is a tree, made of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; and discarded construction materials. Recycling, Mr. Ayala said, is part of his group's ethos. (Ropavejeros translates to ''rag-and-bone men,'' merchants who sell scavenged goods.) The tree's trunk is pierced with black axes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The tree represents nature; the axes represent the corporations that are trying to destroy nature,'' said Mr. Ayala, who grew up the son of Ecuadorean farmers. ''The idea was to use symbols to represent our shared struggles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. de Anda introduced him to Heather Henson, a daughter of Jim Henson, who helped add an interactive element to the bicycle-powered float.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atop the tree sits a nest; Ms. Henson designed bird kites that will fly around it. Mr. Ayala and his group made smaller mechanical birds, called ornithopters, to take wing from the nest. Powered by springing rubber bands, the ornithopters contain their builders' stories and poems about immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want to portray ourselves as birds, because we also fly, we also migrate, we also look for shelter in other lands,'' Mr. Ayala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uprooted tree, and its circling birds seeking haven, tackle the issues in an elegant way. (After the march, elements will be exhibited at Windows on Amsterdam, a community gallery at City College.) ''Climate&nbsp;change is terrifying,'' Ms. de Anda said, but with this float, ''there's still some fun and poetics to it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It resonated with the Brazilian photographer Sebasti&atilde;o Salgado, who plans to march with Ropavejeros. ''If I was in Paris, I would be marching; if I was in Rio, I would be marching,'' Mr. Salgado said through a spokesman. ''With no exception, we must come together, as this has to rise to the top of our leaders' agenda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ayala hopes it also entrances kids. ''We wanted to make it playful,'' he said, ''but at the end we want to have a clear message: Protect our home. Our planet is our nest.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As the United Nations convenes sessions on global warming and population growth, a new study foresees rising human numbers through 2100. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations and the streets of Manhattan are going into global warming saturation mode, from Sunday's People's Climate March through the Tuesdayclimate&nbsp;change&nbsp;summit convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and on through an annual green-energy event called Climate Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Largely missed in much of this, as always seems the case with climate&nbsp;change discussions, is the role of population growth in contributing both to rising emissions of greenhouse gases and rising vulnerability to climate hazards in poor places with high fertility rates (think sub-Saharan Africa).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's too bad given that on Monday a separate special session of the General Assembly is scheduled to hold a 20th-anniversary review of actions since the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. As Bob Engelman of the Worldwatch Institute mused at a Wilson Center meeting in Washington last week, there needs to be much more crosstalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, rates of consumption of fossil energy and forests per person matter more than the rise in human numbers. As I've said before, 9 billion vegan monks would have a far different greenhouse-gas imprint than a similar number of people living high on the hog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But family planning, for instance, should absolutely be seen as a climate resilience strategy in poor regions. This is how I put it in 2010:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's population is projected to double - from one to&nbsp;two billion - by 2050. That means exposure to [deep, implicit] climate hazards will greatly increase in many places even if climate patterns don't change at all. So family planning, and&nbsp;sanitation and water management, sure sound like vital parts of any push for climate progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd be happy to shift my view if someone can explain a flaw in my logic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read this timely (and aptly titled) piece by two former United Nations Population Division officials, Joe Chamie and Barry Mirkin for more: &quot;Climate&nbsp;Change and World Population: Still Avoiding Each Other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, trajectories for fertility rates, particularly in Africa, are showing few signs of modulating, leading to this sobering title on the latest analysis of United Nations population data, published in the current edition of Science:&nbsp;&quot;World population stabilization unlikely this century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study uses models to generate not only a range of outcomes for population through 2100, but also probabilities. Robert Kunzig at National Geographic, who's been writing in depth on human population growth for years, has a superb analysis of this paper and other work, led by the Austrian demographer Wolfgang Lutz, pointing to more modest growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What everyone cited in his article agrees on is that Africa is a critical region (read about Nigeria, particularly!) and that women's access to secondary education and contraception are the key to shifted trajectories on family size - and so much else, of course. Please read Lutz's piece on &quot;Population policy for sustainable development&quot; for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I reached out to one of the authors of the Science paper, Adrian E. Raftery, a professor of statistics and sociology at the University of Washington, for a final thought on the many benefits of action:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projected rapid population increase in Africa may well exacerbate a range of challenges: environmental, health and social, including climate&nbsp;change. On the other hand, if fertility decline accelerates, Africa stands to gain many benefits. These include a demographic dividend, which happens when a country experiences a rapid reduction in fertility rates. This leads to a period of 30 years or so when there are relative few dependents (children or old people), and many more resources are available for infrastructure, education, environmental protection and so on. This dividend can be reaped even while population is increasing (albeit more slowly).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If African population growth could be kept to the lower end of our projected interval (3.5 billion instead of the median of 4.2 billion, compared with the current 1 billion), the outcomes would likely be much better. That's another 2.5 billion people instead of 3.2 billion by 2100. It doesn't sound that different, but it could change a lot of things. It's feasible with the right policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the policies that can help to achieve this. The first is to improve access to contraception. 25 percent of women in sub-Saharan Africa who do not want to become pregnant are not using contraception, and this number hasn't changed in 20 years. The second is to improve girls' education. For example, more than 25 percent of girls in Nigeria do not complete primary schooling.The issues are priorities, resources and political will. Population was a major world concern up to the 1990s (with a peak at the Cairo conference in 1994), but since then has fallen off the world's agenda. This now seems to have been premature. Population should come back as a major world priority. There's a need for the world as a whole to support families and governments in high-fertility countries improve access to contraception and education.                       </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Jackson is scientific director of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and emeritus senior scientist at the Smithsonian Institution and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is executive director of the Waitt Institute, an ocean conservation group.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARROTFISH eat algae and seaweed. These brightly colored fish with beaklike mouths inhabit coral reefs, the wellsprings of ocean life. Without them and other herbivores, algae and seaweed would overgrow the reefs, suppress coral growth and threaten the incredible array of life that depends on these reefs for shelter and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was happening in Bermuda, until the government in 1990 banned fish traps that were decimating the parrotfish population. Today, Bermuda's coral reefs are relatively healthy, a bright spot in the wider Caribbean, where total coral cover has declined by half since 1970.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, in a reminder of just how dire the situation facing the world's coral reefs is, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it was listing 20 species of coral as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, including all of what were once the most abundant Caribbean corals. The action focused primarily on the projected impacts of global warming and ocean acidification. Carbon dioxide emissions are increasing ocean temperatures and making them more acidic -- and less hospitable for corals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But climate&nbsp;change is only half the story. Up to now, the impacts of climate&nbsp;change on reefs have been much less destructive than the localized effects of overfishing, runoff pollution from the land and the destruction of habitats from coastal development. Those problems have exploded in intensity over the past century and will continue to increase sharply with population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proof of the destructive power of those impacts is evident in the central Pacific where, in spite of rising temperatures, coral cover is many times higher around islands unaffected by fishing and pollution, compared with heavily fished and polluted reefs of nearby islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent detailed assessment of the changing status of Caribbean reefs over the past 40 years by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the International Union for Conservation of Nature provides a similarly important finding that offers hope. Across the Caribbean, reefs near islands with effective local protections and governance, like the ones around Bermuda, have double the amount of living coral compared with those that lack those protections. They also have more fish and clearer waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Florida, banning fish traps -- which should result in more parrotfish, less algae and more coral -- has not stemmed coral decline. That's because of extreme local pressures from millions of residents and tourists and insufficient controls on development. Similar problems plague the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which is being damaged by agricultural runoff and the development of huge ports for exporting coal. Fishing is carefully regulated there, but those other threats must be equally well managed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few remaining places in the wider Caribbean with relatively healthy reefs have one thing in common: a greater abundance of parrotfish and other herbivores. They also benefit by being adjacent to islands with comparatively small populations, more modest development and less pollution. You find this in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, on reefs around Cura&ccedil;ao and Bonaire and in protected marine areas in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stories about coral reefs commonly focus on doom and gloom. But these new findings indicate that there is actually something we can do right now to help reefs recover: prevent overfishing, overdevelopment and pollution from the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this lessens our concerns about climate&nbsp;change as humanity burns more coal and oil instead of less. But there is increasing evidence that protection from local stresses promotes the resilience of reef corals to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Caribbean islands are moving to control overfishing and pollution. Barbuda just enacted legislation to protect parrotfish, stop overfishing and establish marine sanctuaries. And the Bahamas, Belize, Bonaire, Cuba and Cura&ccedil;ao are working to enhance protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the condition of the coral reefs of the Florida Keys, the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is among the worst in the wider Caribbean, despite vast sums invested in the monitoring of reefs and research on the effects of climate&nbsp;change. This monitoring and research are vitally important, but collecting information without strong corrective action is like a doctor analyzing a patient's decline without doing everything possible to save her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to move immediately beyond listings of species as threatened and research about climate&nbsp;change and take rigorous action against the local and global stresses killing corals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coral reefs are vital to the economies of the 38 Caribbean countries and territories and their millions of people. These reefs generate roughly $3 billion annually in tourism and fishing and provide protection from storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To save coral reefs, we need to follow the lead of Barbuda and our other proactive neighbors. We need to stop all forms of overfishing, establish large and effectively enforced marine protected areas and impose strict regulations on coastal development and pollution while at the same time working to reduce fossil fuel emissions driving climate&nbsp;change. It's not either/or. It's all of the above.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This just in: Saving the planet would be cheap; it might even be free. But will anyone believe the good news?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've just been reading two new reports on the economics of fighting climate&nbsp;change: a big study by a blue-ribbon international group, the New Climate Economy Project, and a working paper from the International Monetary Fund. Both claim that strong measures to limit carbon emissions would have hardly any negative effect on economic growth, and might actually lead to faster growth. This may sound too good to be true, but it isn't. These are serious, careful analyses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But you know that such assessments will be met with claims that it's impossible to break the link between economic growth and ever-rising emissions of greenhouse gases, a position I think of as ''climate despair.'' The most dangerous proponents of climate despair are on the anti-environmentalist right. But they receive aid and comfort from other groups, including some on the left, who have their own reasons for getting it wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the new optimism about climate&nbsp;change and growth coming from? It has long been clear that a well-thought-out strategy of emissions control, in particular one that puts a price on carbon via either an emissions tax or a cap-and-trade scheme, would cost much less than the usual suspects want you to think. But the economics of climate protection look even better now than they did a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one side, there has been dramatic progress in renewable energy technology, with the costs of solar power, in particular, plunging, down by half just since 2010. Renewables have their limitations -- basically, the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow -- but if you think that an economy getting a lot of its power from wind farms and solar panels is a hippie fantasy, you're the one out of touch with reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side, it turns out that putting a price on carbon would have large ''co-benefits'' -- positive effects over and above the reduction in climate risks -- and that these benefits would come fairly quickly. The most important of these co-benefits, according to the I.M.F. paper, would involve public health: burning coal causes many respiratory ailments, which drive up medical costs and reduce productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thanks to these co-benefits, the paper argues, one argument often made against carbon pricing -- that it's not worth doing unless we can get a global agreement -- is wrong. Even without an international agreement, there are ample reasons to take action against the climate threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to the main point: It's easier to slash emissions than seemed possible even a few years ago, and reduced emissions would produce large benefits in the short-to-medium run. So saving the planet would be cheap and maybe even come free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the prophets of climate despair, who wave away all this analysis and declare that the only way to limit carbon emissions is to bring an end to economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You mostly hear this from people on the right, who normally say that free-market economies are endlessly flexible and creative. But when you propose putting a price on carbon, suddenly they insist that industry will be completely incapable of adapting to changed incentives. Why, it's almost as if they're looking for excuses to avoid confronting climate&nbsp;change, and, in particular, to avoid anything that hurts fossil-fuel interests, no matter how beneficial to everyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But climate despair produces some odd bedfellows: Koch-fueled insistence that emission limits would kill economic growth is echoed by some who see this as an argument not against climate action, but against growth. You can find this attitude in the mostly European ''degrowth'' movement, or in American groups like the Post Carbon Institute; I've encountered claims that saving the planet requires an end to growth at left-leaning meetings on ''rethinking economics.'' To be fair, anti-growth environmentalism is a marginal position even on the left, but it's widespread enough to call out nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you sometimes see hard scientists making arguments along the same lines, largely (I think) because they don't understand what economic growth means. They think of it as a crude, physical thing, a matter simply of producing more stuff, and don't take into account the many choices -- about what to consume, about which technologies to use -- that go into producing a dollar's worth of G.D.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here's what you need to know: Climate despair is all wrong. The idea that economic growth and climate action are incompatible may sound hardheaded and realistic, but it's actually a fuzzy-minded misconception. If we ever get past the special interests and ideology that have blocked action to save the planet, we'll find that it's cheaper and easier than almost anyone imagines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Fixing Climate&nbsp;Change May Add No Costs, Report Says'' (news article, Sept. 16) brings us good news on the practicality of moving to cleaner energy sources, but there is more: The article does not mention the enormous costs that climate&nbsp;change has already begun levying on all of us in the form of damage from extreme weather. The cleanup costs after storms like Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina are in the tens of billions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While scientists cannot link any particular weather event to climate&nbsp;change, they do conclude that extreme storms will be much more frequent as a result of global warming. The damage becomes that much worse as sea level rises. Warming temperatures have also multiplied the acreage destroyed by wildfires in the Western United States many times over. These costs eventually hit everyone, in the form of higher taxes (or loss of other services) and higher insurance premiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costs of moving away from fossil fuels can be minimized even further for average citizens by implementing a carbon fee and dividend plan: Tax carbon emissions at the source and return all revenue to households in the form of dividend checks. This way, the rising price of fuel oil and gasoline is offset. People can continue life as usual, or put their dividends to good use by reducing their gas and oil consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An added benefit: a boost to the Main Street economy and the creation of new jobs in the wind and solar industries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This just in: Saving the planet would be cheap; it might even be free. But will anyone believe the good news?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've just been reading two new reports on the economics of fighting climate&nbsp;change: a big study by a blue-ribbon international group, the New Climate Economy Project, and a working paper from the International Monetary Fund. Both claim that strong measures to limit carbon emissions would have hardly any negative effect on economic growth, and might actually lead to faster growth. This may sound too good to be true, but it isn't. These are serious, careful analyses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But you know that such assessments will be met with claims that it's impossible to break the link between economic growth and ever-rising emissions of greenhouse gases, a position I think of as ''climate despair.'' The most dangerous proponents of climate despair are on the anti-environmentalist right. But they receive aid and comfort from other groups, including some on the left, who have their own reasons for getting it wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the new optimism about climate&nbsp;change and growth coming from? It has long been clear that a well-thought-out strategy of emissions control, in particular one that puts a price on carbon via either an emissions tax or a cap-and-trade scheme, would cost much less than the usual suspects want you to think. But the economics of climate protection look even better now than they did a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one side, there has been dramatic progress in renewable energy technology, with the costs of solar power, in particular, plunging, down by half just since 2010. Renewables have their limitations -- basically, the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow -- but if you think that an economy getting a lot of its power from wind farms and solar panels is a hippie fantasy, you're the one out of touch with reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side, it turns out that putting a price on carbon would have large ''co-benefits'' -- positive effects over and above the reduction in climate risks -- and that these benefits would come fairly quickly. The most important of these co-benefits, according to the I.M.F. paper, would involve public health: burning coal causes many respiratory ailments, which drive up medical costs and reduce productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thanks to these co-benefits, the paper argues, one argument often made against carbon pricing -- that it's not worth doing unless we can get a global agreement -- is wrong. Even without an international agreement, there are ample reasons to take action against the climate threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to the main point: It's easier to slash emissions than seemed possible even a few years ago, and reduced emissions would produce large benefits in the short-to-medium run. So saving the planet would be cheap and maybe even come free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the prophets of climate despair, who wave away all this analysis and declare that the only way to limit carbon emissions is to bring an end to economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You mostly hear this from people on the right, who normally say that free-market economies are endlessly flexible and creative. But when you propose putting a price on carbon, suddenly they insist that industry will be completely incapable of adapting to changed incentives. Why, it's almost as if they're looking for excuses to avoid confronting climate&nbsp;change, and, in particular, to avoid anything that hurts fossil-fuel interests, no matter how beneficial to everyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But climate despair produces some odd bedfellows: Koch-fueled insistence that emission limits would kill economic growth is echoed by some who see this as an argument not against climate action, but against growth. You can find this attitude in the mostly European ''degrowth'' movement, or in American groups like the Post Carbon Institute; I've encountered claims that saving the planet requires an end to growth at left-leaning meetings on ''rethinking economics.'' To be fair, anti-growth environmentalism is a marginal position even on the left, but it's widespread enough to call out nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you sometimes see hard scientists making arguments along the same lines, largely (I think) because they don't understand what economic growth means. They think of it as a crude, physical thing, a matter simply of producing more stuff, and don't take into account the many choices -- about what to consume, about which technologies to use -- that go into producing a dollar's worth of G.D.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here's what you need to know: Climate despair is all wrong. The idea that economic growth and climate action are incompatible may sound hardheaded and realistic, but it's actually a fuzzy-minded misconception. If we ever get past the special interests and ideology that have blocked action to save the planet, we'll find that it's cheaper and easier than almost anyone imagines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey explores a 2016 presidential campaign, he is under growing pressure from his State Legislature to rejoin a regional cap-and-trade program that would limit New Jersey's carbon emissions -- and likely hurt his chances for the Republican nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Christie, who withdrew from the program in 2011 as he first considered running for president in 2012, remains adamant that New Jersey not participate in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, even though the majority of state legislators say it would be in New Jersey's economic and legal interests. Business groups remain divided on the plan. ''No, I would not think of rejoining it,'' Mr. Christie told reporters during a recent trip to Mexico. ''I think it's a completely useless plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Jersey Superior Court ruled this year that Mr. Christie failed to follow proper legal procedure when he withdrew his state from the program because his administration did not hold public hearings on the move. To comply with the law, Mr. Christie's administration held a public hearing last month, but has made it clear that the governor still has no plans to rejoin the program. The New Jersey Legislature has voted twice to rejoin, but Mr. Christie vetoed both bills.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political analysts say Mr. Christie's motive in staying out of the plan is to placate powerful conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, which are highly influential in Republican primaries and consider cap-and-trade programs to be energy taxes that hurt business and eliminate jobs. Mr. Christie will be the main speaker at an Americans for Prosperity donor meeting in New York on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is one of those issues where Christie decided he's going to take a firm position that resonates with the G.O.P. and stick with it,'' said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, N.J. ''It doesn't matter what the Legislature wants, it doesn't matter what New Jersey voters want, cap-and-trade is anathema to the base of the Republican Party.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Christie says he is acting for the benefit of his state and that he withdrew because the plan was inefficient and unfair to New Jersey, since other regional states like Pennsylvania did not take part in it. Environmentalists note that Mr. Christie has pledged to ban coal-fired power plants -- the chief source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming -- from New Jersey. In 2011, Mr. Christie also acknowledged the human role in climate&nbsp;change: ''When you have over 90 percent of the world's scientists who have studied this, stating that climate&nbsp;change is occurring and that humans play a contributing role, it's time to defer to the experts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, however, Mr. Christie has avoided speaking publicly about climate science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey became a founding member of the regional plan in 2005 under Gov. Richard Codey, a Democrat. The program, which created a regional cap on carbon emissions and required power plants to buy pollution permits from the states, slightly raised electricity rates in the region. But the overall economies of the participating states improved and their carbon pollution declined, according to a 2011 study by The Analysis Group, a Boston consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Jersey, the study found that electricity bills increased less than one percent as the state collected $118 million in fees for pollution permits purchased by power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on Mr. Christie to rejoin the program intensified in June, when President Obama proposed an Environmental Protection Agency regulation that would require all states to create climate-change plans. For states under the regional plan that once included New Jersey, complying will largely mean operating under the existing cap-and-trade system. Energy policy experts as well as some of Mr. Christie's fellow state Republicans -- including his mentor, Thomas Kean, a former New Jersey governor -- say the most efficient way for New Jersey to comply with the rule would be to rejoin the program. ''I disagreed with the decision when he did it,'' Mr. Kean said in an interview. ''I wish we'd stayed in the program.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Senator Kip Bateman, a Republican who voted to rejoin the plan, said it was the best option available to the state. ''It wasn't perfect, but we're better off being in it than not being in it,'' he said. ''The problem is, groups such as Americans for Prosperity are adamantly opposed to it. They have scared a lot of Republicans away from it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity, which receives funding from the libertarian billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch, spent heavily in the 2010, 2012 and 2014 elections to oppose candidates who supported cap-and-trade. The group took aim at Republican candidates in primary races who signaled that they would back climate-change policy, and it is expected to play a key role in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. ''We were exceedingly pleased that the governor got New Jersey out of the R.G.G.I. boondoggle,'' said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, referring to the regional plan. ''It's something that A.F.P. in New Jersey worked hard on, and the governor listened, and we applauded him pulling out and applaud him for refusing to go back in.'' Mr. Phillips said the move would be sure to help Mr. Christie's efforts in the Republican primaries, should he run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many Republican politicians question the established science that burning fossil fuels warms the planet, support in New Jersey for climate-change policies increased after Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeast in 2012. Experts say no single storm can be directly attributed to climate&nbsp;change, but a federal study released in May, the National Climate Assessment, concluded that climate&nbsp;change is making the Northeast more vulnerable to deluges, rising sea levels and higher storm surges. Last year a Stanford University poll found that 80 percent of New Jersey adults think the government should take action to limit greenhouse gases from industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after withdrawing from the program, New Jersey customers still have slightly higher electricity bills because the state is part of a wider regional electricity market, said Susan Tierney, an author of the Analysis Group report and a former top Energy Department official in the Clinton administration. Ms. Tierney also noted that the state no longer enjoyed the revenue flow from companies paying for pollution permits. ''It would be a very economically efficient thing for New Jersey to rejoin,'' she said. ''They could get more bang for their buck and have money to circulate back into the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey's largest electric utility, Public Service Enterprise Group, supported the state's participation in the program and has pushed to take the policy national. Michael Jennings, a company spokesman, wrote in an email that the utility is ''advocating that the E.P.A. allow states like New Jersey the flexibility to pursue a comprehensive approach to reduce greenhouse gases.'' But he did not directly address questions about Mr. Christie's refusal to join the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist, the utility is remaining silent so as not to antagonize the governor. ''They're concerned about getting ahead of where Christie is,'' said. ''They're a New Jersey company. They have to get along with the administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some New Jersey businesses agree with Mr. Christie. ''We supported the governor's position to withdraw,'' said David Brogan, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. ''It was a flawed program. We already pay some of the highest rates for energy in the nation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If New Jersey does not rejoin, the state will still be required to come up with a carbon reduction plan under Mr. Obama's proposed rule, which requires New Jersey to cut its carbon pollution by 42 percent by 2030. Last week Mr. Christie told reporters that he did not believe new policies would be required, given his pledge to ban coal plants. ''So I think New Jersey is very well positioned without R.G.G.I. and our people don't need another tax on their utility bills to make some environmentalists feel good on a program that is absolutely worthless in my view.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Michael Bloomberg, a mayor turned U.N. climate envoy, explains what cities can do to blunt climate change and its impacts. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently had a chance to ask former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg about the fresh push he's making for urban action to blunt climate impacts and greenhouse gas emissions as the new United Nations Special Envoy for Cities and Climate&nbsp;Change. He'll be a very busy man next week, as the city hosts the People's Climate March, a U.N. &quot;summit&quot; on climate&nbsp;change and Climate Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full interview is in OnEarth, a magazine published by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Here are several of the question and answers, followed by a link to the rest:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the energy and resilience fronts, it's pretty clear that the challenges facing mature, developed-nation cities like New York or London are different from the ones being faced by fast-growing metropolises in developing nations-cities like&nbsp;Ho Chi Minh City&nbsp;or&nbsp;Guangzhou. As your administration found, for instance,&nbsp;80 percent of the buildings&nbsp;in New York City today will still be in use in 2050, meaning that a push for energy thrift is largely one of retrofitting. In Asia and Africa, by comparison, much of the urban infrastructure has yet to be built, and there may be less capital and capacity for making energy-smart investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the most glaring opportunities for sharp cuts in fossil-generated energy in these two situations? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fast-growing cities that are still taking shape, smart city planning can make a big difference. Cities can build sustainability into their fabric as they grow. They can incorporate energy-efficient building practices from the beginning. They can embrace density and mass transit, instead of sprawl and highways. It's true that some of these policies require significant up-front investments, but they pay off in the long run by lowering energy costs, improving public health and making a city more attractive to people-who, in turn, help attract investment. Creating a city that people want to live in is the best way to create a city that businesses want to invest in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, older big cities have two main areas they can focus on to significantly reduce emissions: buildings and transportation. On the buildings side, retrofits can make a big difference. So can checking and adjusting a building's systems to make sure they are working as efficiently and effectively as they should be. This was one of the single most effective things we did to reduce New York City's carbon footprint. On the transportation side, expanding mass transit to reduce congestion is critically important, and by &quot;mass transit,&quot; I mean anything from subways and commuter rails to buses and bikes.&nbsp; Electric vehicles also represent a big opportunity-both private and city-owned vehicles. Cities can help build out the infrastructure to speed the transition, which is also something we did in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for resilience in the face of rising seas and storm surges, you gave a creditable speech on climate&nbsp;change adaptation in your final year in office, but it had a classic&nbsp;&quot;no retreat&quot;&nbsp;theme, centering on this line:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[A]s New Yorkers, we cannot and will not abandon our waterfront. It's one of our greatest assets. We must protect it, not retreat from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of the scientists and engineers I've interviewed in 25 years of writing on global warming see the hardening of shorelines as an inevitable failure, given the forecast of centuries of rising seas. At the same time, I recognize that there's no way-yet-that a mayor could stay in office with a campaign saying, &quot;We&nbsp;will&nbsp;____ retreat,&quot; regardless of what adverb filled that gap (for example, &quot;smartly&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think it's possible to create a political environment that truly reflects our coastal realities in the coming decades?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember: four of every five New York City residents live on an island. Manhattan is entirely surrounded by water. So is Staten Island. Brooklyn and Queens are on an island. And the Bronx is surrounded by water on three sides. So I was stating what should be obvious: we're a waterfront city, and we must learn to live with rising sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we&nbsp;can. If you look at what happened during Sandy, buildings that were built according to modern, higher construction standards fared far better than those that weren't. Something like 95% of the buildings that were destroyed or severely damaged during Sandy were built more than 50 years ago, before modern building code standards. New infrastructure-including parks that we built along the waterfront that took climate risks into account-suffered relatively little damage, or even no damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of waterfront cities, whether it's New York or Miami, or anywhere else- and most of the world's major cities are coastal cities-depends on our ability to adapt to rising sea levels and climate&nbsp;change. You can't pick up Manhattan and move it inland, but you&nbsp;can&nbsp;adopt policies that better protect it from storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the least appreciated aspects of urban life that offers real promise in cutting climate&nbsp;change risks is the ability to create a new generation of energy and climate problem solvers within city schools, at all levels. In the Bronx earlier this year, I was thrilled to tag along with students on a &quot;field trip&quot; to the boiler room at the public&nbsp;High School for Energy and Technology, where the custodian and teachers revealed the energy choices that make a school-or any other building-run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What innovations in education have you witnessed that you feel will give cities, and society more generally, the capacity to thrive in this changing environment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A great example with a similar focus to the one you've just described is&nbsp;Energy Tech, one of the six-year high schools we created to connect students directly to 21st&nbsp;century industries. We teamed up with Con Ed, National Grid, and CUNY [City University of New York] to create it. The kids who go there get to take college-level classes and get hands-on internship experience at two of the biggest energy utility companies in the nation, where they'll be exposed to many of the major challenges surrounding energy and climate. After six years, they graduate with an Associate's Degree, as well as a high-school diploma. Then they can decide whether they want to continue with college or enter the workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-school diploma is no longer the ticket into the middle class that it was when I was growing up. We have to give students the skills that the global economy demands, and the cities that do the best job of that will be well-positioned to grow and thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wrote a while back that the United Nations' laudable mission of developing goals, which have mostly been aimed at ending deep poverty and its attendant ills, might now need to be expanded such that new goals were being developed for, and pursued by, the world's most prosperous communities as well. (The piece was titled &quot;Do the Top Billion Need New Goals?&quot;) Clearly, we'll never live in a world where everybody on the planet occupies some happy median, but nevertheless, do you similarly believe that we need to embrace a new definition of &quot;success&quot; in this coming century of planetary constraints?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest engine for reducing poverty and disease has been capitalism, and the rise in living standards that has accompanied it. We shouldn't turn our back on that. And at the same time, as our technology advances, our method of producing and consuming things is becoming more efficient, and it will continue to. So we don't have to choose between raising living standards and saving the planet. In New York City, we were able to create a record number of jobs while also&nbsp;driving down our carbon footprint&nbsp;by 19%. Between 2005 and 2013, the city's population grew by about a quarter-million people-but our overall energy consumption stayed essentially the same. Progress like this is happening in cities all around the world, and as cities learn which policies and technologies are most effective, their progress is accelerating. The world's cities are growing fast. And that's a good thing for our planet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a three-story warehouse in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, hundreds of people are working to turn the People's Climate March planned for Sunday into a visual spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were victims of Hurricane Sandy from the Rockaways toiling with artists on a 30-foot inflatable life preserver, and immigrant artists constructing a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; tree embedded with axes. Elsewhere, religious leaders were building an ark and scientists were constructing a chalkboard covered with calculations about carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The run-up to what organizers say will be the largest protest about climate&nbsp;change in the history of the United States has transformed New York City into a beehive of planning and creativity, drawing graying local activists and young artists from as far away as Germany.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is the final crunch, the product of six months of work to make the People's March a big, beautiful expression of the climate movement,'' said Rachel Schragis, a Brooklyn-based artist and activist who is coordinating the production of floats, banners and signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march, organized by more than a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, is planned to wend its way through Midtown Manhattan along a two-mile route approved by the city's Police Department last month. It will start at 11:30 a.m. at Columbus Circle, then move east along 59th Street, south on Avenue of the Americas and west on 42nd Street, finishing at 11th Avenue and West 34th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the nuclear disarmament demonstration that drew more than 500,000 people to Central Park for speeches in 1982, the event on Sunday will rely on the marchers themselves to broadcast a message of frustration and anger at what organizers describe as a lack of action by American and world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1 p.m., after a moment of silence, marchers will be encouraged to use instruments, cellphone alarms and whistles to make as much noise as possible, helped by at least 20 marching bands and the tolling of church bells across the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're going to sound the burglar alarm on people who are stealing the future,'' said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the group 350.org, which is helping to organize the march, and the author of several books about climate&nbsp;change, notably ''The End of Nature,'' published 25 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Since then we've watched the summer Arctic disappear and the ocean turn steadily acidic,'' Mr. McKibben said in a phone interview on Wednesday. ''It's not just that things are not getting better. They are getting horribly worse. Unlike any other issue we have faced, this one comes with a time limit. If we don't get it right soon, we'll never get it right.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers say it is impossible to predict how many people could show up. But 1,400 ''partner organizations'' have signed on, ranging from small groups to international coalitions. In addition, students have mobilized marchers at more than 300 college campuses, and more than 2,700 climate events in 158 countries are planned to coincide with the New York march, including rallies in Delhi, Jakarta, London, Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, organizers are expecting 496 buses from as far away as Minnesota and Kansas to bring marchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The most useful gallon of gasoline anyone will ever burn is the one that gets them to the march,'' Mr. McKibben said. (By contrast, all floats will be pulled by biodeisel-powered cars and trucks or by hand, organizers said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forecast called for mostly sunny weather with a high temperature of 81, which would encourage a larger turnout. In February 2013, more than 40,000 protesters turned out in Washington to demand action on climate&nbsp;change and to challenge the contentious Keystone XL pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are closing off Central Park West north of Columbus Circle, and organizers are asking marchers to gather from West 65th to West 86th Street, before the start of the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Cagan, a longtime New York activist who coordinated the nuclear disarmament demonstration in 1982, has met numerous times with the Police Department to iron out the logistics of Sunday's march. ''That area on Central Park West can hold a lot of people -- we believe between 80,000 and 100,000,'' she said. The police would not provide estimates of the number of expected attendees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers have asked marchers to go to various themed staging areas along Central Park West depending on their leanings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a contingent of labor, families, students and older adults can congregate north of West 65th Street under the rubric ''We Can Build the Future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers have run phone banks, blanketed subway stations with fliers and issued weekly news releases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also produced a 52-minute documentary, ''Disruption,'' about planning the march. The film, released on Sept. 7, includes footage of meetings and pre-march rallies -- interspersed with lessons on climate&nbsp;change and the lagging efforts so far to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers say they chose Sunday because it comes ahead of a climate summit at the United Nations on Tuesday. World delegates are expected to hold high-level discussions about climate&nbsp;change that will lay the groundwork for a potential global agreement on emissions next year in Paris. (Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced on Tuesday that he planned to join the march.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When the secretary general invited world leaders to this summit, all of us in the climate justice movement thought, 'Left to their own devices, these guys will do the same thing they've done for 25 years -- i.e., nothing,' '' Mr. McKibben said. ''So we thought, we better go to New York, too.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Thursday: What to expect at Sunday&amp;#8217;s march, blue skies, and a tortoise is unveiled. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good morning on this fine Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are getting out their climate marching shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And possibly their kazoos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People's Climate March is happening on Sunday in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We checked in with Lisa Foderaro, The Times's reporter who covered the preparations for the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climax will be a moment of cacophony at 1 p.m., when about 20 marching bands and church bells across the city will &quot;sound the alarm&quot; on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horns, whistles, cellphone alarms and other disruptive noisemakers are encouraged, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion is the United Nations Climate Summit next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march is part demonstration, part parade. For months, people have prepared floats and huge props.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Rockaways group has this big 30-foot life preserver that is orange and silver that they'll carry over their heads,&quot; Ms. Foderaro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientists have a chalkboard with calculations about carbon levels. Religious leaders have this ark that they will ride in. A Filipino group has a giant mop to symbolize having to clean up after the typhoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march, which as of this week had confirmed 496 buses coming from as far away as Kansas, will coincide with similar events in 158 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the buses will be using gas, the floats will either be powered by biodiesel or pulled by hand, Ms. Foderaro noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some things to know if you're going: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central Park West north of Columbus Circle to 86th Street will be closed to traffic before the march. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People can gather from 65th Street to 86th Street. These are the access points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The march starts at 11:30 a.m. at Columbus Circle and ends at 11th Avenue and 34th Street, where participants can join a party until 5 p.m. This is the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 12:58 p.m., there will be a moment of silence followed by several moments of loud noise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once, fires in the city had to be detected by watchmen, who stood in towers, scanning the horizon for smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One historic tower still stands today: a 47-foot, cast-iron tower, designed by Julius B. Kroehl, atop an outcropping in what is now Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The watchtower, built in 1857, was decommissioned when alarms came along in 1878, and its fortunes have dwindled ever since. Now, it is about to be dismantled, The Times reports. It's not clear when, or even if, it will be restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time, though, when the tower guarded the entire upper end of Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It served another purpose, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one period it governed time in all of Harlem and the surrounding villages. All watches and clocks within sound of the bell were regulated by it,&quot; The Times noted in 1896. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firefighters rang the bell at 8 a.m., noon and 9 p.m.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was proposed several years ago to tear the tower down on account of its shaky condition, but the residents raised such an opposition that it was left standing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;If the great 1821 hurricane struck the East Coast today, it would leave a $100-billion trail of losses. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be extremely quiet here at what's typically the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, but that's no reason to relax. All it takes is one great storm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, Swiss Re, the giant reinsurance company, spends a lot of time and money going back in time trying to gauge the scope of losses it may have to cover in years to come. Its experts work with officials in places like New York City to try to limit exposure to hazards that, while rare, are ultimately inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why one of the company's atmospheric and ocean scientists, Megan E. Linkin (the photo is from when she was interviewed for The Times in 2010), just re-ran one of the region's most awesome disasters - the great Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane of 1821, but with today's heavily developed metropolitan region in harm's way. The result is, needless to say, deeply sobering, showing that the losses from Hurricane Sandy were, as many experts have warned, nowhere near a worst case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study's bottom line? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the 1821 Hurricane were to happen today, it would cause 50% more damage than Sandy and potentially cause more than $100 billion in property losses stemming from storm surge and wind damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a question I put to Linkin: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the&nbsp;&quot;we will not retreat&quot; politics that still seems to dominate storm politics in coastal cities, do you foresee a real-world way to soften shorelines and create more resilient urban planning given what's laid out in this analysis - and the inevitability of decades of rising seas ahead in a warming climate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's her answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing coastal community resilience is critical to confront climate&nbsp;change and its negative implications. Coastal communities are a significant aspect of the United States economy, currently contributing $6.6 trillion to the total U.S. GDP, and providing 51 million jobs.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the resiliency measures looked at by New York, which other coastal communities can consider, include floodwalls, levee systems, relocation of critical building infrastructure such as electrical equipment and wetland replenishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurance industry has an important role in helping all communities, including those along the coasts, understand and prepare for the risks they face.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good example of this is Swiss Re's work with the City of New York, during the Bloomberg administration.  Swiss Re used climate&nbsp;change scenarios by incorporating rising sea levels in our underwriting tools so that the city could translate feet of sea level rise into dollars of potential economic losses. The benefit of this analysis for the City was twofold; first, the analysis provided officials with an independent market-based estimate of the city's hurricane risk and second, by incorporating resiliency measures directly into Swiss Re's underwriting tools, city decision makers received a cost-benefit and could see which resiliency measures made sense financially, and which they considered too expensive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Sunday's ''People's Climate March'' in New York City could be the biggest demonstration yet for action on climate&nbsp;change. The march is scheduled to coincide with the United Nations Climate Summit, which begins two days later. Despite the advance billing and the official nature of the summit, the march is what matters. The U.N. Summit will a clubby gathering of world leaders and their representatives who will try to figure out ways to reward polluters for pretending to fix a problem for which they're responsible in the first place; a fiasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not hyperbole, either. The summit is a little like a professional wrestling match: There appears to be action but it's fake, and the winner is predetermined. The loser will be anyone who expects serious government movement dictating industry reductions in emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when governments dealt with international threats. Now, as the columnist George Monbiot says, they ''propose everything except the obvious solution -- legislation.'' Rather, they will talk, commission panels, invoke market-based solutions and even offer subsidies to industry, rather than say, for example, ''Wealthy nations are reducing emissions globally by 8 to 10 percent per year, beginning now.'' By Klein's estimates, that's precisely what it will take to avoid catastrophe and that is precisely what we are not going to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Monbiot points out, when the ozone layer threat emerged, an international protocol was established, ozone-hole-making chemicals were banned, and that threat was drastically reduced. And just as we knew how to repair the ozone layer, we know how to combat climate&nbsp;change: Slow the burning of fossil fuels, speed up the development of alternative energy sources, and mandate that at least two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves be left in the ground. It's simple, even straightforward and, as my colleague Justin Gillis wrote in yesterday's Times, not even expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But carbon polluters clearly have more political clout than makers of hair spray, and there's another tragic element at work here, a hole in the heart of government that developed at about the same time as that in the ozone layer: Neoliberalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neoliberalism has given us a ''system'' in which corporate power is stronger than ever and government controls weaker than they've been in a century. The net result is that some corporations are more powerful than governments, both domestically and globally. To fix, or combat, or deal with a threat to the wellbeing of citizenry like climate&nbsp;change is the business of government, but governments are no longer able to dictate what industry does. (No one has said this more eloquently than Monbiot: ''Humankind's greatest crisis coincides with the rise of an ideology that makes it impossible to address.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There remain several possible responses to climate&nbsp;change. One is stupidity: ''There is no crisis.'' (A subset of this is to acknowledge the crisis privately, but deny it or choose to ignore it publicly.) A second is hopelessness: ''It's all over.'' (Sadly, many of my friends fall into this category.) A third is blind faith in technology, as if it were easier to modify the power of nature than to change a system that resists not only radical change but even tinkering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a fourth is action, a fight to regain democracy (a.k.a. ''who is government for?'') and begin to remember quaint little slogans like ''the greatest good for the greatest number,'' to recognize that the payoff for seriously fighting climate&nbsp;change is not only the survival of our species (and others) but a better society. As Naomi Klein says, ''Climate&nbsp;change isn't just a disaster. It's also our best chance to demand and build a better world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what makes this march important. To paraphrase Bill McKibben, it's not so much about changing light bulbs as it is about changing the system that's powering our destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein, whose new book, ''This Changes Everything,'' is the workbook for this new, more assertive, more powerful environmental movement (and the subtitle of which, ''Capitalism vs. The Climate,'' sums things up neatly), argues convincingly that ''our economic system and our planetary system are now at war ... there are policies that can lower emissions quickly, and successful models all over the world for doing so. The biggest problem is that we have governments that don't believe in governing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If government believes that energy assets cannot possibly be stranded and capital must be allowed to pursue its interests no matter how harmful, there's only one strategy for slowing the temperature rise that will eventually cripple the earth for 1,000 years. Unless you want to leave it to the very corporations that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and fighting change, which isn't much of a strategy. Remember that Exxon Mobil remains in the world's top three most profitable corporations. Why would it want anything to change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, the only choice is for people to fight climate&nbsp;change ourselves, by confronting the fossil fuel industry and fighting plutocracy. And while marches rarely change things immediately, they do demonstrate potential power. Sometimes, marches and associated activities -- in recent times, most notably against the Vietnam War and for civil rights -- have made a difference in moving history in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capitalism needs to expand in order to survive, Exxon Mobil is not going to willingly give up its stranded assets, and government will not force it to. And yet corporate sacrifice is in order. Chris Hayes convincingly compares the essential losses that fossil fuel companies face if we are to reduce the impact of climate&nbsp;change -- somewhere between $10 and $20 trillion, according to his estimates -- with the costs to slaveholders at the end of the Civil War. This was within government's power, and can be again, but not this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why so many centrists, liberals and progressives are depressed into inaction; they see no way of winning this struggle, no matter how critical. This defeatism, in turn, leads to Obama-style compromises in which the importance of working to limit the catastrophic effects of climate&nbsp;change are acknowledged but action is mostly limited to adaptation to those effects, adaptation that cannot possibly succeed in the long run without complementary mitigation. The fact is we must burn fewer fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll continue to burn carbon short-term, but we don't need the added risk of projects like the Tar Sands and fracking. Rather, we need policies that scale renewable energy sources up quickly. Klein cites the example of Germany, which reached a goal of making about 25 percent of its energy clean and renewable within 15 years, not through nuclear energy or massive hydroelectric projects but with bold national policies that systematically encouraged small players like municipalities and co-ops. (The parallels to agriculture are obvious, appealing, and relevant, but you can draw those conclusions yourself here.) ''If,'' says Klein, ''you believe that because this is a big problem you need mega solutions -- well, that's not true. The most successful approach is decentralized and small, not, 'me and my friends will start an energy co-op,' but well-designed government policies that support small, clean, local energy generators.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this will be easy, of course, but climate&nbsp;change provides us with an opportunity to remake our society in an image that comes closer to its rhetoric. ''If we are to have any hope of making the kind of civilizational leap required of this fateful decade...'' writes Klein, we need ''a robust social movement [that will] demand (and create) political leadership that is not only committed to making polluters pay for a climate-ready public sphere, but willing to revive two lost arts: long-term public planning, and saying no to powerful corporations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can change what seems inevitable; it will just take sacrifice and hard work, what Klein calls ''Marshall Plan levels of response.'' We are nowhere near that now, though we can point to thus-far successful opposition to destructive projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and the ongoing moratorium on fracking in New York State, or support for the success of the divestment movement. These are important, but compared to the scope of the threat they are not nearly enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to think bigger, and we have that opportunity. The same things that can fix climate can fix many other problems -- agriculture, health care, inequality, campaign finance -- because to be successful the climate movement must be a pro-democracy movement. That would change everything.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The nation's capital is likely to see record flooding by 2050, putting about $7 billion worth of property, three military bases and parts of the National Mall at risk as a result of climate&nbsp;change that is raising sea levels all over the world, according to a report released Tuesday by the research group Climate Central.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is one of the group's more conservative estimates in a report titled ''Washington, D.C., and the Surging Sea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the worst case, the group draws an end-of-the-century picture of the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials as islands in a flooded Potomac River, and Fort McNair, the Washington Navy Yard and parts of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling completely under water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists' warnings about the effects of climate&nbsp;change are not new, with predictions that melting polar ice will lead to a rise in sea levels that will lap around the edges of New York, turn Houston into a latter-day Venice and force millions of residents in low-lying nations like Bangladesh out of their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dangers to Washington are acute, the report said. Contrary to popular myth, the city was not built in a swamp, but it is in a flood plain, and its officials and engineers have tamed the wild Potomac. Those advances could be turned back as the seas rise, the report said. And that may affect the nation well beyond the District of Columbia's boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The monument area and the Mall are in some ways the soul of Washington, D.C., so to see those areas flooding, I think, will probably have an important emotional and cultural effect, as well as a physical effect,'' said Ben Strauss, director of Climate Central's Program on Sea Level Rise and the report's lead author. A sea-level increase of about four feet by the end of the century would most likely lead to at least one damaging flood more than eight feet above high tide, the study says. The current record of 7.9 feet was set in 1942.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study's lowest estimate, which accounts for a rise in the sea level of just one and a half feet, predicts flooding more than six feet above high tide in just 16 years, akin to some of the most severe floods the city has seen. Just four floods have exceeded six feet since 1931.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You could go from a situation where you buy a home, it's never been flooded before in memory, it's a low flood risk,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''And by the time you pay off your mortgage, it's getting flooded every single year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also released analyses of the risks facing Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, and some of the most troubling findings show how climate&nbsp;change will affect military installations, Mr. Strauss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ''labyrinth of tidewater channels and creeks'' in the Norfolk, Va., area make the naval base there, the world's largest, especially vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change, Mr. Strauss said. Among the three states, Virginia's population is most at risk, with 107,000 residents living less than five feet above high tide, the researchers said. Maryland has the most property at that level, with more than $19.6 billion at stake.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a series of moves aimed at cutting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, powerful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has secured voluntary agreements from some of the nation's largest companies to scale down or phase out their use of HFCs, which are factory-made gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Red Bull, Kroger, Honeywell and DuPont, the company that invented fluorinated refrigerants, have agreed to cut their use and replace them with climate-friendly alternatives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, the administration estimated that the agreements announced on Tuesday would reduce cumulative global consumption of HFCs by the equivalent of 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2025. That is about 1.5 percent of the world's 2010 greenhouse gas emissions, or the same as taking 15 million cars off the road for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came a week before President Obama is expected to join over 100 other world leaders at a United Nations climate&nbsp;change summit in New York, which will begin 15 months of negotiations as leaders work toward a global climate&nbsp;change agreement in Paris next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary focus of that deal will be to push for enactment of new laws around the world aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, the abundant planet-warming gas caused by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Negotiators anticipate it will take a grueling battle to achieve such an agreement, which would require the world's largest economies -- including the United States, China and India -- to greatly cut their use of burning coal and oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But climate policy advocates say small steps aimed at reducing other greenhouse gases will also help. While HFCs are less abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, they have 10,000 times the planet-warming potency. But carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, while HFCs disintegrate after about 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every drumbeat in this symphony helps. It drives it along. This is part of that drumbeat,'' said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. ''The benefits from cutting non-CO2 come much faster,'' he added. ''CO2 is like a supertanker -- you can stop it, but it keeps drifting for a long time. Cutting HFCs are like stopping a steamboat. You stop it and that's that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's announcement also came as part of the Obama administration's efforts to push for an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, aimed at decreasing HFCs worldwide. That agreement was designed to cut emissions of gases that harm the ozone layer. Last year, the Obama administration announced an agreement with China to jointly work toward phasing down HFCs in both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has directed federal agencies to purchase alternatives to HFCs whenever possible, to work on expanding a list of HFC alternatives, and to fund Energy Department research into HFC alternative technologies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A close look at the intensifying dance between the United States and China over how to cut greenhouse gas emissions. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Goodell, who's written fine books on &quot;big coal&quot; and the batch of climate-manipulating ideas known as geo-engineering, has written an invaluable feature on China's energy and climate plans for Rolling Stone: &quot;China, the Climate and the Fate of the Planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piece centers on Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to China in July, and thus appropriately casts China's policy choices on greenhouse gases and its deep dependence on coal in the broader context of the never-ending &quot;you first&quot; dance between these two greenhouse-gas giants. Read on for a couple of excerpts, but please click the link at the end and explore the full story (which includes a fund tidbit about Kerry's guitar passion): </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piece is particularly important reading ahead of the United Nations climate &quot;summit&quot; early next week (an event that China's top leadership is skipping, along with India's and Australia's). Goodell's reporting reinforces the case made recently by former United States senators Tim Wirth and Tom Daschle, who seek a softer approach to climate treaty negotiations despite continuing calls for a new binding agreement late next year in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodell discusses several trends that hint an agreement is more achievable now than a few years ago, including this one:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China is in the midst of a profound economic and social transformation, trying to reinvent itself from an economy based on selling cheap goods overseas to an economy based on selling quality consumer goods at home, while keeping growth rates high and cutting dependence on fossil fuels. Energy demand is expected to double by 2030, and at that pace, there is not enough oil, coal and gas in the world to keep their economy humming. So China's ongoing energy security depends on the nation developing alternative energy sources in a big way. &quot;We need more of everything,&quot; says Peggy Liu, a sustainability leader who works across China. &quot;Wind, solar, a modernized grid. We need to leapfrog over the past and into a clean-energy future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's leaders are also waking up to the fact that recent decades of hypergrowth, most of it fired by coal, have exacted a steep price. Air pollution in China's big cities is among the worst in the world; one recent report found that poor air quality contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010. As Hank Paulson, former Secretary of the Treasury and longtime China observer, has put it, &quot;What is another point of GDP worth, if dirty air is killing people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese leaders know this trajectory is unsustainable - economically and politically. Earlier this year, Premier Li Keqiang &quot;declared war&quot; on pollution. Party leaders in China now routinely talk about the importance of &quot;rebalancing the economy&quot; and creating an &quot;ecological civilization.&quot; China Daily, the Communist Party house organ, regularly runs stories about air pollution and toxic waste. While I was in Beijing, I asked U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus why the Chinese were now willing to talk so openly about environmental issues. &quot;The fragility of their government,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;They will have a social revolt on their hands if they don't come up with a way of dealing with this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on reporting he did earlier this year at one of the unofficial rounds of climate talks in Bonn, Germany (been there, done that, my sympathies), Goodell writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris agreement will largely be a &quot;bottom up&quot; treaty, in which each country will put forward a &quot;contribution&quot; for what each is willing to do to reduce carbon pollution. Those contributions will then be reviewed in the future - exactly how and by whom isn't clear - to make sure each nation is keeping its promise. There will be no legally binding caps on emissions, no mandated &quot;targets&quot; that countries need to reach. In fact, it will not be a treaty at all (a treaty would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which everyone knows will never happen). It will likely be an agreement &quot;with legal force,&quot; which means, basically, that some parts of the agreement might be legally binding in some countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on that Bonn visit, he recalls a telling discussion with Zou Ji, a top Chinese climate strategist (for more, see my video intervierw with Zou Ji here):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I got a preview of the kind of arguments U.S. negotiators will face when I bumped into Zou Ji, the deputy director general for the National Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Strategy and International Cooperation and a key member of the Chinese negotiating team, in the lobby of the Maritim Hotel. I asked him if the recent action by Obama to limit pollution from power plants and increase fuel-efficiency standards had changed the dynamics in the negotiations. &quot;It is a good thing,&quot; Ji told me. &quot;But now, America says to us, 'Your turn to step up.' Well, we welcome what you have done, but we want to see more action from the U.S. first. It is very clear that Congress is a big constraint for you; Obama can only do what he can do.&quot; Ji argues, accurately, that the U.S. is still the far richer country, and while China's carbon emissions are enormous, if you break it down to per-capita emissions, the average American is responsible for dumping almost three times as much CO2 into the atmosphere every year as the average Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I point out to him that this is true, but that cumulative emissions in China will soon dwarf those in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China needs to do its part, but right now the U.S. still has huge potential to do more,&quot; he says forcefully. &quot;I have lived in the U.S., where everyone has a clothes dryer and an air conditioner and a big refrigerator and a big house and a big car. In the EU and Japan, they also live well, but people there only consume half the energy Americans do. You do have the capacity to live at the same standard and consume far less - if you choose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line? You first.Please do read the whole piece here.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global economy is undergoing a remarkable transformation that is altering our ability to deal with climate&nbsp;change. The growth of emerging economies, rapid urbanisation and new technological advances are making possible a new path of low-carbon growth in ways that were not apparent even five years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that if left unchecked greenhouse gas emissions will cause devastating climate&nbsp;change. What is now becoming clear is that reducing emissions is not only compatible with economic growth and development - if done well it can generate better growth than the old high-carbon model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take cities. The evidence shows that better planned and connected cities based on mass public transport systems tend to be economically more dynamic and have a much higher quality of life than those based on urban sprawl. They also have much lower carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in energy we are on the verge of a revolution. The price of solar and wind power has fallen so far that in several countries renewable energy no longer needs any subsidy. At the same time, coal has become more costly and less secure. It is now likely that renewable energy could make up half of all new electricity generation by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a new wave of technological innovation offers the potential to transform the demand for energy, both in industry and by consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is beginning to happen, with many examples from around the world of good policy, entrepreneurial businesses and competitive markets combining to generate low-carbon growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the world is to limit global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial times, global emissions will have to peak and then begin to fall in the next 10-15 years. That requires a big shift towards low-carbon investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a shift is now possible. Over the next 15 years, around $90tn (&pound;55tn) is likely to be invested in the world's cities, land use and energy systems. If we build low-carbon infrastructure, we can achieve multiple economic, social and environmental benefits with vastly reduced emissions. But governments must choose. Over recent years many have vacillated over policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the necessary policy shifts, two stand out. First, a strong and rising carbon price, implemented through tax or emissions trading schemes, is an essential foundation of a low-carbon economy. It ensures that polluters pay and efficiency is rewarded. Second, governments should achieve a strong and equitable international climate agreement next year. This would send a powerful signal that the future of the global economy will be low carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prize before us is huge. We can build a strong, inclusive and resilient global economy that can also avoid dangerous climate&nbsp;change. But the time for decisions is now.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world can still stave off the worst effects of climate&nbsp;change, and enjoy the fruits of continued economic growth as long as the global economy can be transformed within 15 years, a group of the world's leading economists and political leaders will argue today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling climate&nbsp;change can be a boon to prosperity, rather than a brake, according to the study involving a roll call of the globe's biggest institutions, including the UN, the OECD group of rich countries, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and co-authored by Lord Stern, one of the world's most influential voices on climate economics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report comes before a UN-convened summit of world leaders on global warming next week at which David Cameron has pledged to lead calls for strong action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technological advances - in areas as diverse as renewable energy, city design and food production - are making low-carbon growth possible at a scale that was not available when we wrote the Stern review eight years ago,&quot; Stern said. &quot;The examples have strengthened still further, from China to Ethiopia and Copenhagen to New York, showing that there is now an alternative to the old high-carbon development model. But there is still no substitute for leadership: governments must choose the low-carbon path. It won't happen on its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is his most significant intervention in climate politics since the 2006 Stern review of the economics of climate&nbsp;change, which made the case that tackling climate&nbsp;change as a matter of urgency would be cheaper than attempting to deal with the effects of the problem decades in the future. That report changed thinking on global warming and was a significant factor in the agreements forged in Copenhagen in 2009 in which developed and major developing countries for the first time set out joint measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic transformation proposed in the new report would improve the lives of billions, the authors argue, from people suffering from air pollution in crowded cities to farmers struggling with poor soil in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stern gave the example of cities, which if designed according to public transport needs can have more efficient economies - because people are not spending hours commuting and polluting, with attendant effects on health - as well as better quality of life and lower carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary, Ed Davey, said Britain had already seen benefits from focusing on clean development, and was committed to helping developing countries do the same. He said: &quot;It has required UK business and international investors to recognise the costs of failure and the benefits of change and it has been sustained by a strong, vocal and committed network of NGOs, pressure groups and activists who have been instrumental in sustaining political will and public acceptance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At next week's climate summit, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, will convene heads of state and government from around the world to discuss climate&nbsp;change for the first time since the 2009 Copenhagen conference, which produced the first commitments from countries such as China and India to curb emissions, and marked the first time the US agreed to binding emissions targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convening world leaders again is a risky strategy, but is seen by the UN as essential to pave the way for a crunch meeting in Paris next year, at which governments will attempt to forge a new agreement that will cut global greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when current pledges run out. The EU has vowed to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, but is the only major developed country bloc to have laid out clear plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's report, the New Climate Economy, from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, says that although technological &quot;fixes&quot; to climate&nbsp;change - such as renewable energy, low-carbon fuels, and better urban design - are growing fast, they are nowhere near enough to produce the transformation needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power stations, cities and transport networks are still being engineered on a high-carbon basis - coal-fired power plants, roads rather than public transport, slums without facilities rather than planned developments. Breaking that cycle requires a coordinated effort, from rich and poor countries, that prioritises sustainability and penalises high-carbon growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and an adviser to the report, said: &quot;Economic growth and emissions reductions can be achieved together, the report clearly confirms . . . Pricing CO2 is key. If emitting CO2 came at a reasonable price, this would stabilise investors' expectations so they can push forward the innovation of climate friendly technologies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Study says halting rise of carbon emissions is achievable at modest cost, but this is nothing new. What's stopping us?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is heating up under the pressure of rising greenhouse gas emissions, and the consequences will be dire: an increase in extreme weather, droughts, floods, a loss of agricultural productivity, people living precarious lives pushed closer to the brink. But it does not have to be so. Halting the rise of carbon emissions is possible - not only possible, but achievable at a modest cost that will be more than outweighed by the manifest benefits. We spend a little more now, to recoup in the next few decades in the form of breathable air, drinkable water and an atmosphere that doesn't cook us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds familiar? The New Climate Economy report, co-authored by Nicholas Stern, is published on Tuesday but it echoes the warnings first set out in stark terms in his landmark review of the economics of climate&nbsp;change in 2006. Then, his findings were revolutionary. Naysayers had argued that climate&nbsp;change was just too big a problem, too expensive to solve, requiring as it does an overhaul of the world's energy systems and economy. Stern proved - in language that economists can understand - that it could be done, that dealing with climate&nbsp;change need not cost the earth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the data is clearer than ever and the New Climate Economy report, endorsed by a roll-call of the world's major institutions including the World Bank, the OECD and the IMF, spells it out. If we want economic growth, we can have it - while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a new economy that brings a better quality of life for all, and most of all to those living in developing countries where the great majority of future population growth will be. But we can only achieve all of these goals together if we grasp the opportunity within the next 15 years. If we wait any longer, the window will close and we will be doomed to an ever-heating planet and an illusion of growth that in fact impoverishes us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first comprehensive study bringing together all of the world's knowledge on climate&nbsp;change came in 1988, with the inaugural report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change. It concluded that global warming was probably the result of human activities but more scientific research was needed. In the intervening decades, that research has been done and the results are clear. The fifth IPCC report, published in stages from last year to this autumn, sets out clearly the &quot;human fingerprint&quot; on the climate&nbsp;change that is happening, and is projected to get worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all of that scientific knowledge has come technological innovation. Wind turbines were an expensive novelty in the 1980s. Today, several generations of the technology later, they can compete with fossil fuels in generation capacity and on cost. Solar panels have dropped in cost so rapidly that they are economically viable without subsidy in many regions, even those not blessed with constant sunshine. Even fossil fuel-burning power plants have become more efficient, and electric cars provide an alternative to gas-guzzlers, while better building design and more advanced electrical equipment mean we can enjoy modern facilities without rising emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these innovations are available for us to use here and now, not decades in the future. Yet still we are building fossil fuel power plants, exploring for gas that is ever harder and more expensive to find, steaming oil from tar sands. We do so - companies do so on our behalf - because it still, more than 20 years after the world vowed in 1992 to &quot;avoid dangerous climate&nbsp;change&quot;, makes economic sense to burn carbon.</SPAN></P>

Blair Palese is the Australian CEO of 350.org, and she has enormous experience in fossil fuel and oceans campaigning. 350.org is one of the primary organisers for the people's march on 21 September, and Blair has written this guest blog to explain why tens of thousands of Australians will be marching.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend also will see the heads of state from more than 125 countries, including Barack Obama and David Cameron gather in New York for a summit on climate&nbsp;change organised by Ban Ki Moon. This is the first time world leaders have come together on the issue since the landmark Copenhagen summit in 2009 and the UN Secretary General hopes the summit will inject new momentum to reach a global deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in Paris at the end of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazingly Australia's our own prime minister, Tony Abbott, will be in New York for the UN Security Council meeting - no doubt to talk about war - but refuses to attend the Climate Summit. Although this may have come as a disappointment for the EU Commissioner for climate action, few in Australia are surprised as this government has already made its priorities and prejudices abundantly clear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Prime Minister of Australia, the world's second largest exporter of coal, has chosen to shun this summit speaks volumes about why we need the People's Climate Mobilisation. With global leaders so far failing to act in the world's best interest to address climate&nbsp;change, it's time for the global public to not only show that it is demanding change but that we will also act together to bring about the change we need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People's Climate events are planned in almost every continent in the world. In Bogata, Columbia, over 10,000 people are expected to join in a march through the capital calling for action. In rural Papua New Guinea, students from a primary school will march to a nearby lighthouse, recently semi-submerged due to rising sea levels. In Tanzania, the Maasai people plan to march, calling for action to protect their ancient homeland in the Serengeti. On the other side of the world, on the border between Vancouver and Seattle, thousands of people will link hands across the boundary to show that climate&nbsp;change knows no borders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Australia, an epic Climate March will convene in Melbourne with a group committed to walking 700 km along the eastern seaboard to Canberra, arriving at Parliament to raise awareness about climate impacts. There are over 30 People's Climate events taking place in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, as well as on Magnetic Island on the Great Barrier Reef, in Alice Springs, Darwin and the remote mining town of Mount Isa. Organisations such as Get Up!, Avaaz, the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Our Land Our Water Our Future and the Leard Alliance are working nationally to organise and support large and small events alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most impressive things about the day and the 2,000 plus events taking place across the globe is not just the individuals organising and taking part but the thousands of organisations - including unions, medical professionals, faith, social justice and community groups and those fighting for the rights of immigrants, refugees and indigenous peoples, that have signed on. The People's Climate Mobilisation is about how we use this opportunity to build the networks we need to demand global leadership and real action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has welcomed a report finding that reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved at a low cost and with added benefits in the form of a better quality of life for people around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks on Twitter, Obama said: &quot;This study concludes that no one has to choose between fighting climate&nbsp;change and growing the economy.&quot; The reaction is significant in advance of key talks next week convened by the United Nations, when world leaders will meet in New York to discuss climate&nbsp;change for the first time since 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, who will convene next week's meeting, said: &quot;We can no longer afford to burn our way to prosperity. We must manage climate risk for sustained - and sustainable - economic progress. We need a structural transformation in the global economy. This report argues for a new model where economic growth and climate action are mutually reinforcing - and it shows how we can build it. There is no time to lose.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, on the New Climate Economy, was co-authored by leading economist Lord Stern and involved a roll-call of international institutions including the World Bank, the International Energy Agency and the OECD group of rich countries. It concluded that tackling climate&nbsp;change would add only a small amount - about $240bn - to the trillions of dollars of investment that will take place around the world in the next decade and a half, in order to accommodate a growing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the authors warned that if the growth takes place along current, high-carbon lines then the world will be locked in to high carbon emissions for decades to come. For only a small amount of extra investment, businesses and governments can achieve economic growth alongside lower carbon dioxide emissions, which could halt climate&nbsp;change and lead to a better quality of life for citizens, through cleaner air and water and a better environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the most significant intervention in climate politics by Lord Stern since his 2006 review of the economics of climate&nbsp;change found that the short-term costs of tackling emissions were far outweighed by the benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Miliband, leader of the UK's Labour party, said: &quot;Better Growth, Better Climate, is a hugely important report for those who care both about safeguarding our environment for our children and creating a successful, fairer future for us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This report shows there is no contradiction between tackling climate&nbsp;change and growing our economies. However, it is clear a lack of political leadership is undermining the opportunity to act on climate&nbsp;change and secure the jobs of the future. That is why we need a Labour government that will champion a low carbon economy both in the UK and overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green party, said: &quot;Lord Stern is showing the kind of joined-up, evidence-based thinking that's sadly been entirely lacking in British policymaking to date. As he points out, providing warm, comfortable, affordable-to-heat homes, would not only tackle fuel poverty and stress, but also cut excess winter fuel deaths and demands on the NHS, as well as carbon emissions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She highlighted investments in public transport as a key measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandrine Dixson Decl&egrave;ve, director of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, which includes a variety of large UK businesses, said: &quot;The good news is that economic growth and action on climate are not incompatible. On the contrary, there are myriad possibilities for all sectors to get involved in driving low-carbon growth and economic transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we must not wait: the longer we leave it, the higher the costs. Governments and business must act together to ensure the decisions we make today are the right ones to deliver a safe and sustainable future for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By JUSTIN GILLIS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1146 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In decades of public debate about global warming, one assumption has been accepted by virtually all factions: that tackling it would necessarily be costly. But a new report casts doubt on that idea, declaring that the necessary fixes could wind up being effectively free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global commission will announce its finding on Tuesday that an ambitious series of measures to limit emissions would cost $4 trillion or so over the next 15 years, an increase of roughly 5 percent over the amount that would likely be spent anyway on new power plants, transit systems and other infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the secondary benefits of greener policies -- like lower fuel costs, fewer premature deaths from air pollution and reduced medical bills -- are taken into account, the changes might wind up saving money, according to the findings of the group, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are proposing a way to have the same or even more economic growth, and at the same time have environmental responsibility,'' said the chairman of the commission, Felipe Calder&oacute;n, the former president of Mexico and an economist. ''We need to fix this problem of climate&nbsp;change, because it's affecting all of us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission found that some $90 trillion is likely to be spent over the coming 15 years on new infrastructure around the world. The big challenge for governments is to adopt rules and send stronger market signals that redirect much of that investment toward low-emission options, the report found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a massive amount of investment firepower that could be geared toward building better cities, and better infrastructure for energy and agriculture,'' said Jeremy Oppenheim, who led the research for the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the commission found that the requisite steps may make economic sense, that does not mean they will be politically easy, the report says. For instance, the group will recommend that countries eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost about $600 billion a year but are vigorously defended by vested interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will urge nations to take a fresh look at the potential of renewable energy, whose costs are plummeting, and also recommend the adoption of initiatives to halt destruction of forests, use land more efficiently and limit wasteful urban sprawl, among many other steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim that the side benefits, such as better air quality, could potentially offset the costs is likely to be controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, a United Nations body, found in a report earlier this year that these side benefits are real, but it declined to attach a specific value to them because the methodology for doing so is difficult and uncertain. The exercise requires, for instance, defining the economic worth of improved human health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ottmar G. Edenhofer, a German climate economist who helped lead that earlier effort, said in an interview Monday that he was doubtful about the precise values for the side benefits cited in the new report. He served as an adviser to the global commission, but is not an author of the final document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The assumption and the argument that this can be done for free, that's from my point of view overly optimistic,'' Dr. Edenhofer said. ''Yes, you rescue some lives, but to assign monetary values to this is particularly complicated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Edenhofer added, however, that the recommendations in the new report were generally sensible and, if adopted, would help to put the world on a more sustainable path. ''Climate policy is not a free lunch, but it is a lunch worthwhile to buy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the report's recommendations, such as limiting urban sprawl and traffic, may sound utopian, but it cites examples of countries and cities that are already taking such action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a hundred cities in the developing world, for instance, have built fast bus systems using dedicated roads or lanes, achieving efficient public transport at a fraction of the cost of rail systems. Congestion charges in cities like London, Stockholm and Singapore have sharply cut car trips. China is launching ambitious measures to try to gain control of urban sprawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a concerted worldwide push were made to scale up ideas that have already proved successful, the commission found, emissions of heat-trapping gases could be reduced by billions of tons per year, and the chances of limiting global warming to tolerable levels would be greatly improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings come one week before world leaders, including President Obama, gather in New York to discuss climate&nbsp;change. Most experts do not expect any big breakthroughs, but tens of thousands of people are expected to march in the streets of New York and other cities on Sunday to demand stronger action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate was appointed by seven countries spanning the income spectrum: Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Norway, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The commission enlisted some of the world's top economists and business consultants to take a fresh look at the economic questions surrounding climate&nbsp;change. The report, due for release Tuesday morning, was made available in advance to The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report seeks to upend some longstanding assumptions. It points out, for instance, that the cost of renewable energy has been plunging so fast that most previous analyses of its potential role are out of date. ''Renewable energy sources have emerged with stunning and unexpected speed as large-scale, and increasingly economically viable, alternatives to fossil fuels,'' the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most important overall point of the report is that economic policies around the world are still aligned to favor fossil fuels, even though unchecked emissions from coal, oil and natural gas represent a potentially grave risk to future generations. ''We have to get the prices right,'' said Helen Mountford, who worked on the report and is the director of economics at the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere is this issue clearer, the commission said, than in the $600 billion a year spent to subsidize fossil fuels, more than six times the level of subsidies going to renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fossil-fuel subsidies have been reduced in most Western countries and are now relatively low. They are still enormous in some developing countries, especially those that are major oil exporters, where cheap gasoline is seen as something of a national birthright. Venezuela, for instance, sells gasoline for about 6 cents a gallon, encouraging profligate consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries that try to eliminate such subsidies too quickly can run into political problems. This summer, a sudden doubling of fuel prices in Yemen set off riots. But gradual price increases can work, and some experts have called for a much greater focus by institutions like the World Bank on helping countries eliminate subsidies.</SPAN></P>

They report in the journal Science that they can rule out instability in the bedrock on which the Larsen-B sheet was grounded. That leaves &quot;surface warming&quot; as the most likely explanation: in other words, it could have been climate&nbsp;change as a consequence of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide that made the 3,250 square kilometres of ice up to 200 metres thick break off from the rest of Antarctica.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was pretty much the conclusion that many people jumped to at the time, but scientists needed to explore other possible causes, and this cautious confirmation of climate&nbsp;change tells the world something about scientific rigour: only once the sea floor was exposed could researchers, in a series of cruises, make seismic measurements and take samples of the mud below. Scientists have to make certain, and while they take time to make certain, politicians may take time to decide how to react, and then how much to react. Had the case of the Larsen-B ice shelf been an isolated indicator, then perhaps energy secretaries and climate ministers would have been justified in moving at the same glacial pace. But in the 12 years before the dramatic collapse of the ice shelf, and in the 12 years since, researchers on all the world's continents have performed similar rigorous and repeated checks on many thousands of observations of manmade climate&nbsp;change, and the answers all point in just one direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is on the way, with attendant extremes of heat and windstorm, drought and flood, and of course threats to global food security. There may be a legitimate argument about the economic price of concerted political action: there is no longer much argument about the far greater price of global inaction. A UN summit in New York next week is being hailed as the best chance so far to achieve real political movement on an international scale. It is a fair bet that whatever agreements are reached, these will not be enough to halt or even significantly slow the rise in the planetary temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this is too pessimistic. But it is a concern based on experience rather than fatalism. The latest episode in the long-running drama of London's airport expansion plans indicates how seriously Britain takes the carbon dioxide crisis: politicians and their advisers debated alternatives for Heathrow, Gatwick and the mayor of London's preferred estuary complex, but none of them pointed out that to save energy and cut emissions the world must reduce air travel, and go on reducing it. The message from climate science has not changed in the last 25 years. Every week, new research adds to the urgency. The science is rigorous, the political response must be vigorous. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naomi Klein is the star of the new American left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 44, the writer and activist has twice written blockbusters combining ground-level reporting and economic analysis that challenged people to take a hard look at what they took for granted: their shopping choices, America's place in the world, and the devastating effects of arcane trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy and rampant free market ideology. Along the way she gained a following that spans academics, celebrities and street and factory protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her first book, No Logo, about the power of brands over sweatshop workers in Asia who made the products (and the consumers in America and Europe who consumed them), politicised a generation of twentysomethings. It became the handbook of the anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">globalisation protests, and inspired two Radiohead albums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years later, her second book, Shock Doctrine, analysed how wars, coups and natural disasters were used as a pretext to impose so-called &quot;free market&quot; measures. Now Klein is back, writing about capitalism, only this time the fate of the entire planet is at stake. With her new book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate, Klein hopes to set off the kind of powerful mass movement that could - finally - produce the radical changes needed to avoid a global warming catastrophe and fix capitalism at the same time. She argues that we have all been thinking about the climate crisis the wrong way around: it's about capitalism - not carbon - the extreme anti-regulatory version that has seized global economies since the 1980s and has set us on a course of destruction and deepening inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are on a collision course,&quot; she says. Twenty-five years ago, when the first climate scientist was called to testify to Congress and make global warming a policy challenge, there might have still been time for big industries to shrink their carbon footprints. But governments at the time were seized with the idea that there should be no restraints on industry. &quot;During that time,&quot; Klein writes, &quot;we also expanded the road from a two lane, carbon-spewing highway to a six-lane superhighway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we meet in her Toronto home, Klein is juggling a schedule that combines the standard author book readings and television interviews and planning for an event in New York City billed as the biggest climate march ever seen. Her husband, film-maker Avi Lewis, is out shooting a companion film due for release in January. The two text back and forth during our chat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein does not easily fit into most people's view of a committed environmentalist. She drives a car (it is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hybrid). She flies, already a lot more than most people, and is set to rack up air miles that would make her, by her own admission, &quot;a climate criminal&quot;. There is a brightly coloured plastic playhouse in the garden that was probably made in China. Yet she confesses to getting weepy when she thinks about the future under climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a long conversation over the dining table, Klein says she is not about to purge her life of plastics or fossil fuels. She says she is not going to be trapped into &quot;gotcha games&quot; about personal habits. And she is definitely not going to subscribe to the idea that climate&nbsp;change ranks above all other causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there has been this really bad habit of environmentalists being insufferably smug, where they are sort of saying: 'This is the issue that beats all other issues' or, 'Your issue doesn't matter because nothing matters if the earth is fried.'&quot; Klein says committed environmentalists aren't her target anyway. &quot;This book is not written for the environmental movement. It is written much more for people who would never read a book about climate&nbsp;change but are engaged with economic justice of other kinds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is where Klein believes she can do the most good. &quot;I want to act, if I can, as a bridge for people who read Shock Doctrine or No Logo. People who are sitting out for whatever reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein admits that even with her reputation for producing brainy economic analysis, and a crack research team to which she gives generous credit in the book and in conversation, it took</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three years of &quot;marinating&quot; in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">material. &quot;I have amazing research help. Basically what I spend my money on is research,&quot; she says. &quot;The way in which people talk about climate is just so wonky and so abstract and such a boys' club that it makes a lot of women just roll their eyes or feel that they are somehow not qualified,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of writing about climate&nbsp;change took hold of Klein around the time of the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit - legendary now as a failure of international diplomacy. The summit of world leaders, convening soon after the US had its first &quot;green president&quot; in Barack Obama, was supposed to put the major economies on a glide path to cutting emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein came to the meeting planning to write about the great fight between rich and poor countries over the historic responsibility the US and Europe bore for causing climate&nbsp;change. She had dared to hope at one point that a climate deal would be the great equaliser - compensating Africa and Asia for colonialism. But the summit collapsed under the weight of those expectations. Leaders from Africa and small south Pacific Island states, which are slowly drowning under rising sea levels, wanted a more aggressive action that would limit the temperature rise to 1.5C; leaders from rich countries deemed the proposal bad for businesses and rejected it for fear it could cost them votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't prepared for the naming of that inaction by the industrialised world as racism,&quot; Klein says. &quot;I was struck by the fact that African delegates were using words such as genocide, describing a two-degree temperature target as allowing Africa to burn.&quot; She pauses. &quot;I found the Copenhagen experience pretty devastating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a difficult time for Klein personally as well. After the publication of Shock Doctrine, she was on the road for almost two years. She barely saw her husband. While she was travelling the world giving speeches and being hailed as an inspirational figure, Klein found herself in a rut. &quot;I think I was profoundly depressed about 2008-2009,&quot; she says. &quot;I have always told myself that I would not spread hopelessness.&quot; She became convinced it was time to retreat. &quot;I just didn't feel that I had anything to offer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were other difficulties. Klein writes in the book of the surprising realisation that she did want children after all, and of her struggles through what she calls the &quot;fertility factory&quot; and miscarriages before she finally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">became pregnant. Her son, Toma, turned two this summer. The book is dedicated to him. But as she was preparing for publication, Klein was diagnosed, and operated on, for thyroid cancer; she says flatly she will not discuss the illness beyond that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For readers of Klein's earlier works - or of Thomas Piketty's analysis of inequality - the central message of the book will sound familiar. Capitalism, since it was unshackled by the deregulation of the 1980s, has widened the gap between rich and poor. The top 3% held 55% of all wealth last year, up from 45% in 1989. The bottom 90% controlled 24.7% of wealth, according to statistics released this month by the Federal Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not like everything is fine except for the problem that the temperature is going up a little bit,&quot; Klein says. &quot;If the only problem with capitalism was this slight temperature increase, we would really be cooked. But the fact is that there are lots of problems with this system, and on top of all of those problems, it is destabilising our planet's life support system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein believes the gap between the 1% and everyone else and the powerlessness of local governments to take control are casualties of global capital. To follow the course of action she prescribes would require a hostile takeover of large parts of the environmental movement. But that would be entirely warranted, it seems. Environmental groups have wasted time trying to recruit big business and billionaires to adopt pro-climate measures, she says. In the meantime, economies have continued to spew out carbon pollution, making a climate fix far more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need an ideological battle. It is still considered politically unthinkable just to introduce straight-up, polluter-pays punitive measures - particularly in the US.&quot; To Klein, environmentalists should have just gone to war on business, and on the whole concept of capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a devastating chapter, she details how the US's biggest environmental group, the Nature Conservancy, earned money from oil and gas drilling on a parcel of Texas land it had set aside for conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, Klein takes on Richard Branson for failing to live up to his promise to set aside $3bn to fight climate&nbsp;change. &quot;So much hope was put in this parade of billionaires to try and reconcile capitalism with climate,&quot; she says. &quot;When Branson entered the climate game, he posited it specifically as an alternative to regulation. He said 'the governments aren't going to do this, we're going to do this. Go to the UN climate summit in a couple of weeks and it's all going to be the new green economy and the head of Bank of America sitting down with the president of Mexico - and we are all going to do it together.'&quot; She remains irritated. &quot;That is a dangerous idea at this stage of history. We are not talking about a theory here, we are talking about a track record. I think it's fair to say: 'OK, we tried it your way and we don't have another decade to waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, Klein is vague in her book and our conversation about exactly how this would come about. In the book she talks about &quot;an effervescent moment&quot; - when popular protests converge to bring about real change - which comes after a section in the book titled &quot;Magical Thinking&quot;. There is a curious failure to really get to grips with questions about a real-world solution - Klein must have anticipated being asked. If capitalism is going to destroy the world, why wouldn't capitalism fix itself - if only for its own survival?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if capitalism wants anything. The system itself doesn't think as an entity - it thinks as a collection of self-interested profit-seeking units.&quot; Asked why Obama is such a peripheral figure in her book, Klein is ambiguous. &quot;I do think Obama is interesting but more in the sense of an absence,&quot; she says. &quot;Obama should have used the economic bailout of 2009 to impose new rules on car companies,&quot; she says. (In fact, Obama used the bailout to spend up to $100m on home retrofits, subways, and other climate-friendly measures. Klein overlooks these entirely.) &quot;The fact that Obama blew that moment, to me, is one of the great tragedies of our times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fix she proposes broadly relies on scattered groups of climate organisers, grassroots and indigenous people's groups that have been ready to take on corporate power in a way that Big Green is not. Klein admits that most environmental groups are too white, male, and middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein is on the board of one of those emerging grassroots groups: 350.org has played a lead role in reframing a mundane pipeline project, the Keystone XL, until it was seen as one of the most critical environmental decisions of Obama's presidency. The Keystone XL project, meant to transport tar sands crude from Alberta, would probably be well on its way to completion, if the protests by 350.org and Nebraska landowners had not made the project a national issue. Obama has repeatedly put off making a decision about the pipeline. But the deciding factor in that delay was almost certainly the wealthy Democratic donors pushing behind the scenes, and threatening to cut off election funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Klein continues to sees the Keystone fight, widespread local protests against fracking and campus divestment campaigns as the way forward on climate&nbsp;change. She argues there is little scope for individuals on their own to accomplish much, giving the examples of Toronto's impressive carbon-cutting efforts. &quot;It's been kind of disastrous,&quot; she says. &quot;While we are all doing these green things, our country's emissions are soaring because of the tar sands. We are just sort of like suckers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She goes so far as to lump centrist environmental leaders together with groups such as the Heartland Institute, which denies the existence of climate&nbsp;change. &quot;Between the Heartlanders who recognise that climate&nbsp;change is a profound threat to our economic and social systems and therefore deny its scientific reality, and those who claim climate&nbsp;change requires only minor tweaks to business-as-usual and therefore allow themselves to believe in its reality, it's not clear who is more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deluded,&quot; Klein writes in the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are fighting words. Over the past few years, the oil and coal lobbies and, increasingly, super-rich ultra-conservatives in America have spent close to $1bn a year building a network of rightwing organisations that have blocked efforts to cut the emissions that cause climate&nbsp;change - often by claiming that climate&nbsp;change is not even happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are already signs of a pushback on Twitter from some environmental bloggers, even before the book's release. But Klein - who over the years has endured pro-corporate backlash of her two earlier books and a ferocious assault for criticising Israel's conduct against the Palestinians, says she is ready for it. &quot;I have been through attacks that are far more personal and far more intense than what I am going to experience with this book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says she sees a new breed of climate activist, ready to go after corporate power in a way that Big Green is not. &quot;They are going after the fossil fuel companies directly as opposed to just trying to go into business with them,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time she argues there has been a shift in attitudes about how people treat one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not in despair. I am excited by what I am seeing. I think that the task is enormous. I think we are nowhere close to where we need to be, but I think we are on a track,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>

The implication of both is that the government needs to do more. Both were signed by individuals who lobby against civil nuclear power, by far the major source of carbon-free electricity around the world. Hinkley Point C, when built, will produce more carbon-free electricity than all windfarms currently operational in the UK. To act as if carbon-free nuclear is not part of the solution is destructive and threatens our planet. This is understood by more thoughtful environmentalists but not apparently Greenpeace, WFF or the Green party.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 450 deaths were reported as monsoon floods ravaged parts of northern Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir last week. The area is weathering the heaviest rainy season in more than half a century. A photo essay compiled for The Atlantic illustrates the awful scale of the devastation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands remain stranded as New Delhi and Islamabad mount rescue efforts, which many in the regional press have criticized as disorganized and slow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsoons are an annual occurrence in South Asia, but as climate&nbsp;change causes&nbsp;greater variation in seasonal weather patterns, this is unlikely to be the last time the two countries (often at geopolitical odds) join forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something new and strange is indeed afoot,&quot; writes the Indian environmentalist Sunita Narain for Business Standard. &quot;Each year, the floods are growing in intensity. Each year, the rain events get more variable and more extreme. Each year, economic damages increase - and once again, development gains are lost in one season of flood or bad drought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the flooding in northern India and Pakistan is partially attributable to &quot;destroyed drainage in floodplains&quot; because of&nbsp;overdevelopment and mismanaged engineering, she writes, &quot;climate&nbsp;change is beginning to make the country even more vulnerable, because of the increased frequency of extreme weather events.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Global Climate Risk Index for 2014, compiled by the German environmental nonprofit Germanwatch, India and Pakistan are among the world's most at-risk nations for climate&nbsp;change-induced extreme weather events. A report from the World Bank says an expected two degrees Celsius rise in the world's average temperatures will &quot;make India's summer monsoon highly unpredictable&quot; - foreboding news for a country with nearly 400 people per square kilometer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the end of the century, &quot;an extreme wet monsoon that currently has a chance of occurring only once in 100 years is projected to occur every 10 years.&quot; Kolkata and Mumbai, two of the most densely populated cities in the world, will become &quot;impact hotspots&quot; for flooding, tropical cyclones and rising sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future, in other words, looks wet and grim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, Narendra Modi, the new prime minister of India, will reportedly skip the United Nations climate summit scheduled for later this month, causing many to speculate as to whether the recently elected leaders&nbsp;harbors skepticism about the science behind climate&nbsp;change. Recent remarks, both flippant and baffling, have not soothed these concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change? Is this terminology correct?&quot; Mr. Modi asked The Hindu's Amit Baruah last week. &quot;The reality is that in our family, some people are old. They say this time the weather is colder. And people's ability to bear cold becomes less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This clashes with Mr. Modi's pre-election position on the issue. His e-book, &quot;Convenient Action,&quot; published in 2011 when he was chief minister of Gujarat, &quot;frames action on climate&nbsp;change as a moral duty,&quot; according to The Guardian's Suzanne Goldenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This further contradicted his actions in office: &quot;As Gujarat's chief minister, he oversaw the final phases of construction of the hugely controversial Narmada dam,&quot; Ms. Goldenberg reports. &quot;But he goes to great length in the e-book to promote his actions on climate&nbsp;change, expanding the use of solar and wind power and switching to natural gas as fuel for vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since his election, Modi has dismantled a number of environmental protections,&quot; she continues. &quot;Clearing the way for new coal mines and other industrial projects. He also blocked funds for Greenpeace and other environmental groups and is known to be vehemently anti-NGOs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video question and answer session with students from all across India, Mr. Modi's remarks were categorically skeptical: &quot;The climate has not changed. We have changed,&quot; he told a student from the eastern state of Assam. &quot;Our tolerance and habits have changed. If we change, God has built the system in such a way that it can balance on its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He then spent the next six minutes expounding on Indian cultural values on the environment and invoking Hindu scripture, before ending with a surreal reference to threading needles by moonlight,&quot; says Malini Mehra, an Indian environmental activist, writing for the blog Responding to Climate&nbsp;Change. &quot;He had a captive audience of millions of students across the country whose future will be defined by climate&nbsp;change,&quot; she laments. &quot;But instead of educating them on the issue, why it matters to India and what his government planned to do about it, he talked about threading needles in the moonlight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that &quot;Kashmir is suffering the worst floods&quot; since the country's independence from Britain, she writes, &quot;Why can the prime minister of India not give a straight answer on climate&nbsp;change?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after reporting on the 2010 BP oil spill, Naomi Klein discovered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that she was pregnant - and miscarried. Was there a connection?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She looks at the 'greenwashing' of big business and its effects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">denied climate&nbsp;change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most news stories. I told myself the science was too complicated and the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my &quot;elite&quot; frequent-flyer status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A great many of us engage in this kind of denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or maybe we do really look, but then we forget. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we are right. If we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, major cities will drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas; our children will spend much of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. Yet we continue all the same.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is wrong with us? I think the answer is far more simple than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things needed to cut emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have struggled to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck, because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe - and benefit the vast majority - are threatening to an elite minority with a stranglehold over our economy, political process and media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That problem might not have been insurmountable had it presented itself at another point in our history. But it is our collective misfortune that governments and scientists began talking seriously about radical cuts to greenhouse gas emissions in 1988 - the exact year that marked the dawning of &quot;globalisation&quot;. The numbers are striking: in the 1990s, as the market integration project ramped up, global emissions were going up an average of 1% a year; by the 2000s, with &quot;emerging markets&quot; such as China fully integrated into the world economy, emissions growth had sped up disastrously, reaching 3.4% a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That rapid growth rate has continued, interrupted only briefly, in 2009, by the world financial crisis. What the climate needs now is a contraction in humanity's use of resources; what our economic model demands is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it's not the laws of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gets me most are not the scary studies about melting glaciers, the ones I used to avoid. It's the books I read to my two-year-old. Looking For A Moose is one of his favourites. It's about a bunch of kids who really want to see a moose. They search high and low - through a forest, a swamp, in brambly bushes and up a mountain. (The joke is that there are moose hiding on each page.) In the end, the animals all come out and the ecstatic kids proclaim: &quot;We've never ever seen so many moose!&quot; On about the 75th reading, it suddenly hit me: he might never see a moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I went to my computer and began to write about my time in northern Alberta, Canadian tar sands country, where members of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation told me how the moose had changed. A woman killed one on a hunting trip, only to find the flesh had turned green. I heard a lot about strange tumours, which locals assumed had to do with the animals drinking water contaminated by tar sand toxins. But mostly I heard about how the moose were simply gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And not just in Alberta. Rapid Climate&nbsp;Changes Turn North Woods into Moose Graveyard read a May 2012 headline in Scientific American. A year and a half later, the New York Times reported that one of Minnesota's two moose populations had declined from 4,000 in the 1990s to just 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will my son ever see a moose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n our desire to deal with climate&nbsp;change without questioning the logic of growth, we've been eager to look both to technology and the market for saviours. And the world's celebrity billionaires have been happy to play their part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his autobiography/new age business manifesto Screw It, Let's Do It, Richard Branson shared the inside story of his road to Damascus conversion to the fight against climate&nbsp;change. It was 2006 and Al Gore, on tour with An Inconvenient Truth, came to the billionaire's home to impress upon him the dangers of global warming.&quot;It was quite an experience,&quot; Branson writes. &quot;As I listened to Gore, I saw that we were looking at Armageddon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he tells it, his first move was to summon Will Whitehorn, then Virgin Group's corporate and brand development director. &quot;We took the decision to change the way Virgin operates on a corporate and global level. We called this new approach Gaia Capitalism in honour of James Lovelock and his revolutionary scientific view&quot; (this is that the Earth is &quot;one single enormous living organism&quot;). Not only would Gaia Capitalism &quot;help Virgin to make a real difference in the next decade and not be ashamed to make money at the same time&quot;, but Branson believed it could become &quot;a new way of doing business on a global level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the year was out, he was ready to make his grand entrance on to the green scene (and he knows how to make an entrance - by parachute, by jetski, by kitesail with a naked model clinging to his back). At the 2006 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York, the highest power event on the philanthropic calendar, Branson pledged to spend $3bn over the next decade to develop biofuels as an alternative to oil and gas, and on other technologies to battle climate&nbsp;change. The sum alone was staggering, but the most elegant part was where the money would be coming from: Branson would divert the funds generated by Virgin's fossil fuel-burning transportation lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, he was volunteering to do precisely what our governments have been unwilling to legislate: channel the profits earned from warming the planet into the costly transition away from these dangerous energy sources. Bill Clinton was dazzled, calling the pledge &quot;ground-breaking&quot;. But Branson wasn't finished: a year later, he was back with the Virgin Earth Challenge - a $25m prize for the first inventor to figure out how to sequester 1bn tonnes of carbon a year from the air &quot;without countervailing harmful effects&quot;. And the best part, he said, is that if these competing geniuses crack the carbon code, the &quot;'doom and gloom' scenario vanishes. We can carry on living our lives in a pretty normal way - we can drive our cars, fly our planes.&quot; The idea that we can solve the climate crisis without having to change our lifestyles - certainly not by taking fewer Virgin flights - seemed the underlying assumption of all Branson's initiatives. In 2009, he launched the Carbon War Room, an industry group looking for ways that different sectors could lower their emissions voluntarily, and save money in the process. For many mainstream greens, Branson seemed a dream come true: a media darling out to show the world that fossil fuel-intensive companies can lead the way to a green future, using profit as the most potent tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Gates and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg have also used their philanthropy aggressively to shape climate solutions, the latter with large donations to green groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund, and with the supposedly enlightened climate policies he introduced as mayor. But while talking a good game about carbon bubbles and stranded assets, Bloomberg has made no discernible attempt to manage his own vast wealth in a manner that reflects these concerns. In fact, he helped set up Willett Advisors, a firm specialising in oil and gas assets, for both his personal and philanthropic holdings. Those gas assets may well have risen in value as a result of his environmental giving - what with, for example, EDF championing natural gas as a replacement for coal. Perhaps there is no connection between his philanthropic priorities and his decision to entrust his fortune to the oil and gas sector. But these investment choices raise uncomfortable questions about his status as a climate hero, as well as his 2014 appointment as a UN special envoy for cities and climate&nbsp;change (questions Bloomberg has not answered, despite my repeated requests).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates has a similar firewall between mouth and money. Though he professes great concern about climate&nbsp;change, the Gates Foundation had at least $1.2bn invested in oil giants BP and ExxonMobil as of December 2013, and those are only the start of his fossil fuel holdings. When he had his climate&nbsp;change epiphany, he, too, raced to the prospect of a silver-bullet techno-fix, without pausing to consider viable - if economically challenging - responses in the here and now. In Ted talks, op-eds, interviews and in his annual letters, Gates repeats his call for governments massively to increase spending on research and development, with the goal of uncovering &quot;energy miracles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By miracles, he means nuclear reactors that have yet to be invented (he is a major investor and chairman of nuclear startup TerraPower), machines to suck carbon out of the atmosphere (he is a primary investor in at least one such prototype) and direct climate manipulation (Gates has spent millions funding research into schemes to block the sun, and his name is on several hurricane-suppression patents). At the same time, he has been dismissive of the potential of existing renewable technologies, writing off energy solutions such as rooftop solar as &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;noneconomic&quot; (these cute technologies already provide 25% of Germany's electricity).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a decade after Branson's epiphany, it seems a good time to check in on the &quot;win-win&quot; crusade. Let's start with his &quot;firm commitment&quot; to spending $3bn over a decade developing a miracle fuel. The first tranche of money he diverted from his transport divisions launched Virgin Fuels (since replaced by private equity firm Virgin Green Fund). He began by investing in various agrofuel businesses, including making a bet of $130m on corn ethanol. Virgin has attached its name to several biofuel pilot projects - one to derive jet fuel from eucalyptus trees, another from fermented gas waste - though it has not gone in as an investor. But Branson admits the miracle fuel &quot;hasn't been invented yet&quot; and the fund has since moved its focus to a grab-bag of green-tinged products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diversifying his holdings to get a piece of the green market would hardly seem to merit the fanfare inspired by Branson's original announcement, especially as the investments have been so unremarkable. If he is to fulfil his $3bn pledge by 2016, by this point at least $2bn should have been spent. He's not even close. According to Virgin Green Fund partner Evan Lovell, Virgin has contributed only around $100m to the pot, on top of the original ethanol investment, which brings the total Branson investment to around $230m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branson refused to answer my direct questions about how much he had spent, writing that &quot;it's very hard to quantify the total amount. . . across the Group&quot;. His original &quot;pledge&quot; he now refers to as a &quot;gesture&quot;. In 2009, he told Wired magazine, &quot;in a sense, whether it's $2bn, $3bn or $4bn is not particularly relevant&quot;. When the deadline rolls around, he told me, &quot;I suspect it will be less than $1bn right now&quot; and blamed the shortfall on everything from high oil prices to the global financial crisis: &quot;The world was quite different back in 2006. . . In the last eight years, our airlines have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these explanations for falling short, it is worth looking at some of the things for which Branson did manage to find money. In 2007, a year after seeing the climate light, he launched domestic airline Virgin America. From 40 flights a day to five destinations in its first year, it reached 177 flights a day to 23 destinations in 2013. At the same time, passengers on Virgin's Australian airlines increased from 15 million in 2007 to 19 million in 2012. In 2009, Branson launched a new long-haul airline, Virgin Australia; in April 2013 came Little Red, a British domestic airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So this is what he has done since his climate&nbsp;change pledge: gone on a procurement spree that has seen his airlines' greenhouse gas emissions soar by around 40%. And it's not just planes: Branson has unveiled Virgin Racing to compete in Formula One, and invested heavily in Virgin Galactic, his dream of launching commercial flights into space, for $250,000 per passenger. According to Fortune, by early 2013 Branson had spent &quot;more than $200m&quot; on this vanity project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be argued - and some do - that Branson's planet-saviour persona is an elaborate attempt to avoid the kind of tough regulatory action that was on the horizon when he had his green conversion. In 2006, public concern about climate&nbsp;change was rising dramatically, particularly in the UK, where young activists used daring direct action to oppose new airports, as well as the proposed new runway at Heathrow. At the same time, the UK government was considering a broad bill that would hit the airline sector; Gordon Brown, then chancellor, had tried to discourage flying with a marginal rise in air passenger duty. These measures posed a significant threat to Branson's profit margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, was Branson's reinvention as a guilt-ridden planet-wrecker volunteering to solve the climate crisis little more than a cynical ploy? All of a sudden, you could feel good about flying again - after all, the profits from that ticket to Barbados were going to help discover a miracle green fuel. It was an even more effective conscience-cleaner than carbon offsets (though Virgin sold those, too). As for regulations and taxes, who would want to hinder an airline supporting such a good cause? This was always Branson's argument: &quot;If you hold industry back, we will not, as a nation, have the resources to come up with the clean-energy solutions we need.&quot; It is noteworthy that his green talk has been less voluble since David Cameron came to power and made it clear that fossil fuel-based businesses faced no serious threat of climate regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a more charitable interpretation of what has gone wrong. This would grant Branson his love of nature (whether watching tropical birds on his private island or ballooning over the Himalayas) and credit him with genuinely trying to figure out ways to reconcile running carbon-intensive businesses with a desire to help slow species extinction and avert climate chaos. It would acknowledge, too, that he has thought up some creative mechanisms to try to channel profits into projects that could help keep the planet cool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if we grant him these good intentions, then the fact that all these projects have failed to yield results is all the more relevant. He set out to harness the profit motive to solve the crisis, but again and again, the demands of building a successful empire trumped the climate imperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that only capitalism can save the world from a crisis it created is no longer an abstract theory; it's a hypothesis that has been tested in the real world. We can now take a hard look at the results: at the green products shunted to the back of the supermarket shelves at the first signs of recession; at the venture capitalists who were meant to bankroll a parade of innovation but have come up far short; at the fraud-infested, boom-and-bust carbon market that has failed to cut emissions. And, most of all, at the billionaires who were going to invent a new form of enlightened capitalism but decided, on second thoughts, that the old one was just too profitable to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">t some point about seven years ago, I realised I had become so convinced we were headed toward a grim ecological collapse that I was losing my capacity to enjoy my time in nature. The more beautiful the experience, the more I found myself grieving its loss - like someone unable to fall fully in love because she can't stop imagining the inevitable heartbreak. Looking out over British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, at an ocean bay teeming with life, I would suddenly picture it barren - the eagles, herons, seals and otters all gone. It got worse after I covered the 2010 BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico: for two years after, I couldn't look at any body of water without imagining it covered in oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of ecological despair was a big part of why I resisted having kids until my late 30s. It was around the time that I began work on my book that my attitude started to shift. Some of it, no doubt, was standard-issue denial (what does one more kid matter?). But it was also that immersing myself in the international climate movement had helped me imagine various futures that were decidedly less bleak. And I was lucky: pregnant the first month we started trying. But then, just as fast, my luck ran out. A miscarriage. An ovarian tumour. A cancer scare. Surgery. Month after month of disappointing single pink lines on pregnancy tests. Another miscarriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It just so happened that the five years it took to write my book were the same years my personal life was occupied with failed pharmaceutical and technological interventions and, ultimately, pregnancy and new motherhood. I tried, at first, to keep these parallel journeys segregated, but it didn't always work. The worst part was the ceaseless invocation of our responsibilities to &quot;our children&quot;. I knew these expressions were heartfelt and not meant to be exclusionary, yet I couldn't help feeling shut out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But along the way, that feeling changed. It's not that I got in touch with my inner Earth Mother; it's that I started to notice that if the Earth is indeed our mother, then she is a mother facing a great many fertility challenges of her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had no idea I was pregnant when I went to Louisiana to cover the BP spill. A few days after I got home, though, I could tell something was off and did a pregnancy test. Two lines this time, but the second strangely faint. &quot;You can't be just a little bit pregnant,&quot; the saying goes. And yet that is what I seemed to be. After more tests, my doctor told me my hormone levels were much too low and I'd probably miscarry, for the third time. My mind raced back to the Gulf - the toxic fumes I had breathed in for days and the contaminated water I had waded in. I searched on the chemicals BP was using in huge quantities, and found reams of online chatter linking them to miscarriages. Whatever was happening, I had no doubt that it was my doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a week of monitoring, the pregnancy was diagnosed as ectopic - the embryo had implanted itself outside the uterus, most likely in a fallopian tube. I was rushed to the emergency room. The somewhat creepy treatment is one or more injections of methotrexate, a drug used in chemotherapy to arrest cell development (and carrying many of the side-effects). Once foetal development has stopped, the pregnancy miscarries, but it can take weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a tough, drawn-out loss for my husband and me. But it was also a relief to learn that the miscarriage had nothing to do with the Gulf. Knowing that did make me think a little differently about my time covering the spill, however. As I waited for the pregnancy to &quot;resolve&quot;, I thought in particular about a long day spent on the Flounder Pounder, a boat a group of us had chartered to look for evidence that the oil had entered the marshlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our guide was Jonathan Henderson of the Gulf Restoration Network, a heroic local organisation devoted to repairing the damage done to the wetlands by the oil and gas industry. As we navigated the narrow bayous of the Mississippi Delta, Henderson leant far over the side to get a better look at the bright green grass. What concerned him most was not what we were all seeing - fish jumping in fouled water, Roseau cane coated in oil - but something much harder to detect without a microscope and sample jars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spring is the start of spawning season on the Gulf Coast, and Henderson knew these marshes were teeming with nearly invisible zooplankton and tiny juveniles that would develop into adult shrimp, oysters, crabs and fin fish. In these fragile weeks, the marsh grass acts as an aquatic incubator, providing nutrients and protection from predators. &quot;Everything is born in these wetlands,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects for these microscopic creatures did not look good. Each wave brought in more oil and dispersants, sending levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) soaring. And this was all happening at the worst possible moment in the biological calendar: not only shellfish, but also bluefin tuna, grouper, snapper, mackerel, marlin and swordfish were all spawning. Out in the open water, floating clouds of translucent proto-life were just waiting for one of the countless plumes of oil and dispersants to pass through them like an angel of death. Unlike the oil-coated pelicans and sea turtles, these deaths would attract no media attention, just as they would go uncounted in official assessments of the spill's damage. If a certain species of larva was in the process of being snuffed out, we would likely not find out about it for years, and then, rather than some camera-ready mass die-off, there would just be. . . nothing. An absence. A hole in the life cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our boat rocked in that terrible place - the sky buzzing with Black Hawk helicopters and snowy white egrets - I had the distinct feeling we were suspended not in water but in amniotic fluid, immersed in a massive multi-species miscarriage. When I learned that I, too, was in the early stages of creating an ill-fated embryo, I started to think of that time in the marsh as my miscarriage inside a miscarriage. It was then that I let go of the idea that infertility made me some sort of exile from nature, and began to feel what I can only describe as a kinship of the infertile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months after I stopped going to the fertility clinic, a friend recommended a naturopathic doctor. This practitioner had her own theories about why so many women without an obvious medical reason were having trouble conceiving. Carrying a baby is one of the hardest physical tasks we can ask of ourselves, she said, and if our bodies decline the task, it is often a sign that they are facing too many other demands - high-stress work, or the physical stress of having to metabolise toxins, or just the stresses of modern life. Most fertility clinics use drugs and technology to override this, and they work for a lot of people. But if they do not (and they often do not), women are frequently left even more stressed, their hormones more out of whack. The naturopath proposed the opposite approach: try to figure out what might be overtaxing my system, and then remove those things. After a series of tests, I was diagnosed with a whole mess of allergies I didn't know I had, as well as adrenal insufficiency and low cortisol levels. The doctor asked me a lot of questions, including how many hours I had spent in the air over the past year. &quot;Why?&quot; I asked warily. &quot;Because of the radiation. There have been some studies done with flight attendants that show it might not be good for fertility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I admit I was far from convinced that this approach would result in a pregnancy, or even that the science behind it was wholly sound. Then again, the worst that could happen was that I'd end up healthier. So I did it all. The yoga, the meditation, the dietary changes (the usual wars on wheat, gluten, dairy and sugar, as well as more esoteric odds and ends). I went to acupuncture and drank bitter Chinese herbs; my kitchen counter became a gallery of powders and supplements. I left Toronto and moved to rural British Columbia. This is the part of the world where my parents live, where my grandparents are buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradually, I learned to identify a half-dozen birds by sound, and sea mammals by the ripples on the water's surface. My frequent-flyer status expired for the first time in a decade, and I was glad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first few months, the hardest part of the pregnancy was believing everything was normal. No matter how many tests came back with reassuring results, I stayed braced for tragedy. What helped most was hiking, and during the final anxious weeks, I would calm my nerves by walking for as long as my sore hips would let me on a trail along a pristine creek. I kept my eyes open for silvery salmon smolts making their journey to the sea after months of incubation in shallow estuaries. And I would picture the cohos, pinks and chums battling the rapids and falls, determined to reach the spawning grounds where they were born. This was my son's determination, I would tell myself. He was clearly a fighter, having managed to make his way to me despite the odds; he would find a way to be born safely, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know why this pregnancy succeeded any more than I know why earlier pregnancies failed - and neither do my doctors. Infertility is just one of the many areas in which we humans are confronted with our oceans of ignorance. So, mostly, I feel lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I suppose a part of me is still in that oiled Louisiana marsh, floating in a sea of poisoned larvae and embryos, with my own ill-fated embryo inside me. It's not self-pity that keeps me returning to that sad place. It's the conviction that there is something valuable in the body-memory of slamming up against a biological limit - of running out of chances - something we all need to learn. We are built to survive, gifted with adrenaline and embedded with multiple biological redundancies that allow us the luxury of second, third and fourth chances. So are our oceans. So is the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But surviving is not the same as thriving, not the same as living well. For a great many species, it's not the same as being able to nurture and produce new life. With proper care, we stretch and bend amazingly well. But we break, too - our individual bodies, as well as the communities and ecosystems that support us *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma Thompson was on a ship recently, bound for the Arctic, with 37 crew and her 14-year-old daughter, Gaia, part of a Greenpeace mission to highlight global warming. She has done a lot of trips like this, to Africa and south-east Asia - &quot;raising awareness&quot;, as the exhausted phrase goes - but the ship cleaving through ice seemed particularly apt. Thompson, at 55, is regarded as formidable in almost the Edwardian style, the actor-activist more concerned with the cause than with what you might think of her - or, for that matter, with the niceties of the charity world. &quot;When a disaster occurs,&quot; she says, &quot;there can be a rather unsavoury rush to plant the flag of your NGO in the nearest head of whoever's surviving.&quot; She will not bite her tongue for anyone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor, for the most part, will she play the movie star card. We are in Thompson's work space in a semi-detached house in suburban north London, near where she grew up and where her family still lives. She looks like a graduate student in a Greenpeace sweatshirt, torn jeans, owlish glasses and trainers, her face fresh without makeup - an observation that, after spending an hour with Thompson, one hesitates to make for fear of letting the side down. Still, she is an actor, and pulls another version of herself out of the hat when necessary, appearing on talkshows and at awards ceremonies to promote, in the US at least, a highly stylised Englishness that the Americans find charming and the English, perhaps, find a little de trop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's just energy. It's performance energy,&quot; she says. &quot;It's not what you do, and you might regard it with some horror, but it's what I do. And it's what pantomime performers have done for centuries in our country. I don't have to do too much that's truly idiotic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is true. Thompson's roles have, over the years, inspired an unusual devotion. A week before our meeting, I was at a US immigration office in New York where a harried, thirtysomething officer insisted on having a reason for my trip, and when I gave him one, transformed before my eyes. Sense And Sensibility, he said, was his favourite film. I thought he was going to cry. Even at 20 years' distance, Thompson's Elinor Dashwood in the Ang Lee adaptation of Austen's novel - especially the moment where she finds out that Edward Ferrars is not, after all, married - does something weird to one's system; so, too, her Margaret Schlegel in Howards End, and the scene (the only good one) in Love Actually, when she crumples on discovering her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is lusting after someone else. Thompson is ordinarily so brisk, so seemingly sorted and amused, that when she goes, we all go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, she is in a mildly brisk mode today, on a mission to inform us about the planet which, of course, we should be thoroughly engaged with, but who has the time, and aren't there a million other things to be worried about? &quot;It's your grandchildren,&quot; she says. &quot;You've got skin in the game, mate. And if my daughter is lucky enough to have children, if she wishes them, and I have grandchildren, these are the people who are going to be dealing with the mess. So unless we get to grips with this instead of just wibbling on, it's going to be really hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine-day voyage to the Smeerenburg glacier, part of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, was designed to flag up the environmental threats posed by climate&nbsp;change and oil drilling. &quot;We have a dependency, in the same way we had a dependency on tobacco until we realised it killed us. Fossil fuels were a really good idea at the time. But they're not a good idea any more. It's so hard, because you've got corporations with trillions and trillions of dollars who see things that are trapped in the Earth's crust as their inheritance. And I think one of the reasons people zone out is they feel guilty and helpless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point in the Guardian's film of the trip, while standing on the ice in full Arctic gear, she holds up a sign addressed to Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister who, though he has since softened his stance, once referred to climate&nbsp;change science as &quot;crap&quot;. (The sign says: &quot;Tony Abbott Climate&nbsp;Change is REAL I'm Standing In It&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any word from his office?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, sadly not. I'd be very happy to have a chat to Tony about his attitudes to women and abortion. Look at the things that Tony Abbott has said - oh, he's a corker.&quot; She bursts out laughing. &quot;Tragic.&quot; It's embarrassing, I say. Thompson says drily: &quot;People are embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embarrassment is one of the emotions she plays well. Also, indignation and bafflement. Remember her in The Remains Of The Day, trying to wrangle a human response out of Anthony Hopkins' repressed butler? In her most recent role, as PL Travers in the biopic Saving Mr Banks, she went the full Edith Evans with a performance that tipped, here and there, into parody. But Thompson is always fascinating to watch, the frank intelligence of her performances somehow acknowledging the absurdity of the whole acting exercise without ever quite killing off suspension of disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will talk effectively about dwindling roles for women in their 50s, but is affronted by suggestions - even indirect ones - that she downplay her age. While on ship, her daughter made her tweet, something that doesn't come naturally. &quot;No, no, I wouldn't dream of it, normally. It's not my generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. I'm 55. It's not my thing at all.&quot; She says this very firmly, as if countering a wrong but widely held assumption about 55-year-olds in general. &quot;I mean, it took me ages to get used to using a computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is having a great decade, what with the success of the Nanny McPhee franchise, and plaudits for Mr Banks. But don't be fooled, she says. The reason she said yes to Greenpeace (apart from the fact that a great friend asked her) is that it met the stringent criteria she now applies to all projects: &quot;Is the subject right and fascinating, and can I bring every best energy I have to it? Especially now, when time's running out. It's a different patch of life, your 50s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She feels that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes. Absolutely. Sorry. Not in a horrible way, but. . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought 50 was the new 35?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can I just say, very loudly, bollocks. If you look after yourself and you're healthy, then you'll have the energy to do things. But not to recognise getting older for what it is? I do think the infantilisation of our generation is one of the huge issues of our time. People wanting to be 35 when they're 50 makes me think: why? Why don't you be 50 and be good at that? And also embody the kinds of choices that are sustainable at that age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What sort of choices? &quot;Well, I see people starting life over and over again. And you want to say: just go deeper into the one you've got. Because you can skim very easily. It's set up for that because we're such a disposable society. And I think that relationships are regarded as more disposable than they were, and that's short-sighted of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson is married to the actor Greg Wise, whom she met on the set of Sense And Sensibility. Theirs is perceived to be a good union; I tell her that before our meeting, a friend said one of the reasons she admires Thompson is that she &quot;has a great marriage&quot;. She gives me a rather dry look. &quot;I think the first 20 years are the. . . bedrock. And then you can start having a good time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many years has she been married?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She smiles. &quot;Nineteen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a child, Emma Thompson was regarded as bossy. She has said, in interviews, that this impression continued into adulthood and that some, in the past, have found it hard to deal with - &quot;mentioning no names, but my first husband&quot;. (She was married to Kenneth Branagh for six years from 1989.) Now, she says, &quot;I saw 'bossy' used in reference to a man recently, which I thought was very encouraging. I wouldn't refer to myself as bossy in the normal run of things, but of course I was called bossy, constantly, when I was younger. As was and is everyone, as Rebecca West would say, who has an opinion that doesn't chime with that of a doormat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mother, Phyllida Law, and her father, Eric Thompson, were in the entertainment business, a jobbing actor and director. Their two girls, Emma and Sophie, grew up in the mild bohemia of 1970s north London, which Law has written about in two very charming memoirs, Notes To My Mother-In-Law and How Many Camels Are There In Holland? The kitchen table at dinner was a lively place. &quot;We were surrounded by writers and directors and actors, so there was a lot of talk about theatre. But not, I would imagine, the sort of talk that was around Peter Brook's table. It was humbler, really. We talked about books, a bit. Mum's a great reader. But it wasn't a political atmosphere, in the way that our house now has a political atmosphere. I don't think I discovered politics of that kind until I was at uni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parents had to work, as did Thompson from her early 20s; one of the most useful things she learned from her parents is that it is OK to be out of the limelight. &quot;Sometimes there was money and sometimes there wasn't. They weren't particularly famous, none of their friends was famous. It was just a job. It's just my job. Fame is a completely accidental by-product. I don't have any feeling of, you've got to keep your face up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Gaia was born, Thompson scaled back for many years. When she did re-engage, she was lucky to have Wise around to pick up the slack at home. &quot;I could never have done any of my work that involved filming otherwise. Writing's great, but going off to work on something like Saving Mr Banks I couldn't have done. I'd have had to take her with me or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably she could go off with a clear conscience, though, because Gaia was with her dad. &quot;Not really. There's always guilt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last few years, Thompson has been working on first the writing, then the filming of Effie Gray, the story of the 19th-century art critic John Ruskin and his long-suffering wife, played by Dakota Fanning; Thompson plays the imperious Lady Eastlake and Greg Wise plays Ruskin. The film was stuck in legal purgatory for years while Thompson successfully defended two plagiarism suits brought by American writers. It's a strange film, slow and a little thin, but beautifully filmed and the performances are terrific - especially from Wise, who makes Ruskin's rejection of his wife and adherence to his mother (Julie Walters) skin-crawlingly creepy. It's very British, in lots of ways, full of people failing to say what they think or mean, although, as Thompson points out, the Americans can be just as bad. &quot;They're often very dishonest, especially in my business. 'Oh, yeah, great, you were fabulous!'&quot; The Brits probably have it worse, though. &quot;I think the British can be very twisted about their genuine feelings. Have you read (Edward St Aubyn's) Patrick Melrose novels? Oh my god! Talking of false identities and people's disguises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Thompson's delight, Gaia loved the trip to the Arctic, and found the people on ship deeply sympathetic. They were all ages, all backgrounds, some optimists, some pessimists, which Thompson liked. (She is, unusually for someone promoting a cause, deeply sceptical about the aid world. &quot;I liked the fact that you weren't with a load of people saying, 'We're going to save the planet!' The question of whether it's a form of make-yourself-feel-better tourism I think is a very fair one.&quot;) Gaia, meanwhile, said, &quot;'I've found my tribe.' And I knew exactly what she meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a teenager of roughly the same age, Thompson was &quot;very loud and angry&quot;. In the Guardian's video, her daughter comes across as a thoroughly nice kid. &quot;Well, yeah, let's hope so. She's wonderful and I think she's fantastic. I think the proof will be on the analyst's couch in 30 years' time, if that occurs. I don't think so, though, because I think of Gaia and Tindy as being very much hand-reared. They've been checked, and picked out, like a little garden. They haven't been handed over to anyone. There's a lot of soil work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tindy is Thompson's 27-year-old adopted son, a former child soldier from Rwanda whom she and Wise met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16. He has accompanied her on many aid trips and is now a human rights lawyer. Gaia was just two when he came into their lives, and the two regard each other as siblings, absolutely, she says. &quot;For Tindy, Gaia's incredibly valuable, because she's a proper sister. And he drives her mad and they fight. They fight! Which is brilliant. When that happens, I'm secretly thrilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Cambridge in the early 1980s, Thompson shaved her head and grunged out, as the times permitted. Her feminism was uncompromising and it stayed that way after her hair grew back. It is absurd that, by talking without caveat about sexism, she is considered almost eccentrically radical by the standards of her industry. (She traces the destruction of the Arctic - the fact that we're &quot;fucking the Earth over right, left and centre&quot; - to patriarchal standards set during the industrial age. Most Hollywood actresses would rather die than use the word &quot;patriarchy&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it does baffle me. I don't understand. When you say, 'But feminism means equal rights for women' - sorry, what's the problem? You think it's done? Then think again and inform yourselves, because it isn't done. Don't be daft about it. So what's the issue? Is it that there have been feminists who have said things that shock and appal you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps other actresses think they won't get jobs. &quot;Well, I would not be in work if that was the case. It's very, very odd. I've worked with some young, brilliant women whom I would consider feminists, who don't like to use the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does she remonstrate with them? &quot;Yes. I say, why? It seems to be out of fashion. Surely it's a bottom line thing that has nothing to do with fashion, one way or another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenting teens, Thompson says, strikes her as much harder than stewarding younger children. She and her oldest friend from university took Gaia and three other teens to the Reading festival last month, whereupon &quot;the most important thing is that they know you're there, but that you can be picked up and used as and when needed. I think people sometimes think, oh, they're teens now, they're up and running. But this is the crucial time; when they're little, they just need feeding and cuddling. But not this later stuff. You have to be around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thinks back to when she was 15, &quot;reading Jackie fucking magazine. Reading articles like How To Find Your Man And Keep Him. I was wading through a huge heap of insidious twaddle.&quot; The insidious twaddle available to today's teens is much more pervasive. Like most sensible parents, Thompson keeps the computer in the kitchen, but you can't police your teen's phone. The sheer weight of sexual imagery to which they are exposed, she believes, means people growing up now &quot;don't have any connection to their own sexuality. It'll be our children who will tell us later: why the fuck didn't you do something about this? Do you know I haven't had an erection since 1989 or whatever?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has Thompson's strength of feeling, her willingness to campaign, interfered with her work? Would she use a film to proselytise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give me an example of a proselytising film. In The Name Of The Father or something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, except that was a great movie. Could a script light her political fire but still be a bad film? &quot;No, no, no, no, no. I get offered a ton of political stuff, and a lot of the time it's not good enough. There aren't very many films that are truly political and truly great. The Lives Of Others, City Of God. Some of Mike Leigh's are wonderful, and Ken Loach's can be fantastic, but sometimes a bit too proselytising for me. I need to be surprised. It's like reading Victor Hugo's Miserables. I got exhausted by agreeing with him. I thought, yes, I know, it's awful, the poor get shat on.&quot; She chuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was heavily criticised, and called an IRA sympathiser, for In The Name Of The Father, Jim Sheridan's 1993 biopic of the Guildford Four, in which she played defence lawyer Gareth Peirce. And there was criticism when she publicly opposed the first Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of her judgment calls are right, mind you; Thompson added her name to the ill-advised petition in support of Roman Polanski some years ago. &quot;Yes, but then I had to take my name off it. Mike Nichols rang me up and said, sign this, and sent me a documentary about the utterly appalling (judicial) process. Made by a woman. And I thought, OK, well it's a tricky one. Then I spoke to a woman at Tindy's university who said no, rape is rape, and I thought about it and thought, mmm, yeah. Yeah. You're right. And it was such a messed up process of justice, it was rotten. But rape is rape. And you look at what's been going on recently here with Operation Yewtree and it makes your eyes water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaia pops her head round the door, very much following in her mum's sartorial style in DMs and a jacket that would look great on a demo. She is off out for the day. &quot;Are you going to be warm enough, mate?&quot; Thompson says cheerfully. &quot;Take a scarf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She turns back to the kitchen table. Her political interests, she assumes, are tolerated in the US, &quot;because they know I'm going to go away. I'm not going to live there and fiddle with their menfolk. Or indeed their women. I don't know.&quot; And she half-shrugs, as if to say, either way, it doesn't make the blindest bit of difference *</SPAN></P>

Thompson, at 55, is regarded as formidable in almost the Edwardian style, the actor-activist more concerned with the cause than with what you might think of her - or, for that matter, with the niceties of the charity world. &quot;When a disaster occurs,&quot; she says, &quot;there can be a rather unsavoury rush to plant the flag of your NGO in the nearest head of whoever's surviving.&quot; She will not bite her tongue for anyone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor, for the most part, will she play the movie star card. We are in Thompson's work space in a semi-detached house in suburban north London, near where she grew up and where her family still lives. She looks like a graduate student in a Greenpeace sweatshirt, torn jeans, owlish glasses and trainers, her face fresh without makeup - an observation that, after spending an hour with Thompson, one hesitates to make for fear of letting the side down. Still, she is an actor, and pulls another version of herself out of the hat when necessary, appearing on talkshows and at awards ceremonies to promote, in the US at least, a highly stylised Englishness that the Americans find charming and the English, perhaps, find a little de trop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it's just energy. It's performance energy,&quot; she says. &quot;It's not what you do, and you might regard it with some horror, but it's what I do. And it's what pantomime performers have done for centuries in our country. I don't have to do too much that's truly idiotic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is true. Thompson's roles have, over the years, inspired an unusual devotion. A week before our meeting, I was at a US immigration office in New York where a harried, thirtysomething officer insisted on having a reason for my trip, and when I gave him one, transformed before my eyes. Sense And Sensibility, he said, was his favourite film. I thought he was going to cry. Even at 20 years' distance, Thompson's Elinor Dashwood in the Ang Lee adaptation of Austen's novel - especially the moment where she finds out that Edward Ferrars is not, after all, married - does something weird to one's system; so, too, her Margaret Schlegel in Howards End, and the scene (the only good one) in Love Actually, when she crumples on discovering her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is lusting after someone else. Thompson is ordinarily so brisk, so seemingly sorted and amused, that when she goes, we all go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, she is in a mildly brisk mode today, on a mission to inform us about the planet which, of course, we should be thoroughly engaged with, but who has the time, and aren't there a million other things to be worried about? &quot;It's your grandchildren,&quot; she says. &quot;You've got skin in the game, mate. And if my daughter is lucky enough to have children, if she wishes them, and I have grandchildren, these are the people who are going to be dealing with the mess. So unless we get to grips with this instead of just wibbling on, it's going to be really hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine-day voyage to the Smeerenburg glacier, part of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, was designed to flag up the environmental threats posed by climate&nbsp;change and oil drilling. &quot;We have a dependency, in the same way we had a dependency on tobacco until we realised it killed us. Fossil fuels were a really good idea at the time. But they're not a good idea any more. It's so hard, because you've got corporations with trillions and trillions of dollars who see things that are trapped in the Earth's crust as their inheritance. And I think one of the reasons people zone out is they feel guilty and helpless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point in the Guardian's film of the trip, while standing on the ice in full Arctic gear, she holds up a sign addressed to Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister who, though he has since softened his stance, once referred to climate&nbsp;change science as &quot;crap&quot;. (The sign says: &quot;Tony Abbott Climate&nbsp;Change is REAL I'm Standing In It&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any word from his office?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, sadly not. I'd be very happy to have a chat to Tony about his attitudes to women and abortion. Look at the things that Tony Abbott has said - oh, he's a corker.&quot; She bursts out laughing. &quot;Tragic.&quot; It's embarrassing, I say. Thompson says drily: &quot;People are embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embarrassment is one of the emotions she plays well. Also, indignation and bafflement. Remember her in The Remains Of The Day, trying to wrangle a human response out of Anthony Hopkins' repressed butler? In her most recent role, as PL Travers in the biopic Saving Mr Banks, she went the full Edith Evans with a performance that tipped, here and there, into parody. But Thompson is always fascinating to watch, the frank intelligence of her performances somehow acknowledging the absurdity of the whole acting exercise without ever quite killing off suspension of disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will talk effectively about dwindling roles for women in their 50s, but is affronted by suggestions - even indirect ones - that she downplay her age. While on ship, her daughter made her tweet, something that doesn't come naturally. &quot;No, no, I wouldn't dream of it, normally. It's not my generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. I'm 55. It's not my thing at all.&quot; She says this very firmly, as if countering a wrong but widely held assumption about 55-year-olds in general. &quot;I mean, it took me ages to get used to using a computer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is having a great decade, what with the success of the Nanny McPhee franchise, and plaudits for Mr Banks. But don't be fooled, she says. The reason she said yes to Greenpeace (apart from the fact that a great friend asked her) is that it met the stringent criteria she now applies to all projects: &quot;Is the subject right and fascinating, and can I bring every best energy I have to it? Especially now, when time's running out. It's a different patch of life, your 50s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She feels that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes. Absolutely. Sorry. Not in a horrible way, but. . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought 50 was the new 35?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can I just say, very loudly, bollocks. If you look after yourself and you're healthy, then you'll have the energy to do things. But not to recognise getting older for what it is? I do think the infantilisation of our generation is one of the huge issues of our time. People wanting to be 35 when they're 50 makes me think: why? Why don't you be 50 and be good at that? And also embody the kinds of choices that are sustainable at that age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What sort of choices? &quot;Well, I see people starting life over and over again. And you want to say: just go deeper into the one you've got. Because you can skim very easily. It's set up for that because we're such a disposable society. And I think that relationships are regarded as more disposable than they were, and that's short-sighted of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson is married to the actor Greg Wise, whom she met on the set of Sense And Sensibility. Theirs is perceived to be a good union; I tell her that before our meeting, a friend said one of the reasons she admires Thompson is that she &quot;has a great marriage&quot;. She gives me a rather dry look. &quot;I think the first 20 years are the. . . bedrock. And then you can start having a good time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many years has she been married?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She smiles. &quot;Nineteen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a child, Emma Thompson was regarded as bossy. She has said, in interviews, that this impression continued into adulthood and that some, in the past, have found it hard to deal with - &quot;mentioning no names, but my first husband&quot;. (She was married to Kenneth Branagh for six years from 1989.) Now, she says, &quot;I saw 'bossy' used in reference to a man recently, which I thought was very encouraging. I wouldn't refer to myself as bossy in the normal run of things, but of course I was called bossy, constantly, when I was younger. As was and is everyone, as Rebecca West would say, who has an opinion that doesn't chime with that of a doormat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mother, Phyllida Law, and her father, Eric Thompson, were in the entertainment business, a jobbing actor and director. Their two girls, Emma and Sophie, grew up in the mild bohemia of 1970s north London, which Law has written about in two very charming memoirs, Notes To My Mother-In-Law and How Many Camels Are There In Holland? The kitchen table at dinner was a lively place. &quot;We were surrounded by writers and directors and actors, so there was a lot of talk about theatre. But not, I would imagine, the sort of talk that was around Peter Brook's table. It was humbler, really. We talked about books, a bit. Mum's a great reader. But it wasn't a political atmosphere, in the way that our house now has a political atmosphere. I don't think I discovered politics of that kind until I was at uni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parents had to work, as did Thompson from her early 20s; one of the most useful things she learned from her parents is that it is OK to be out of the limelight. &quot;Sometimes there was money and sometimes there wasn't. They weren't particularly famous, none of their friends was famous. It was just a job. It's just my job. Fame is a completely accidental by-product. I don't have any feeling of, you've got to keep your face up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Gaia was born, Thompson scaled back for many years. When she did re-engage, she was lucky to have Wise around to pick up the slack at home. &quot;I could never have done any of my work that involved filming otherwise. Writing's great, but going off to work on something like Saving Mr Banks I couldn't have done. I'd have had to take her with me or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably she could go off with a clear conscience, though, because Gaia was with her dad. &quot;Not really. There's always guilt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last few years, Thompson has been working on first the writing, then the filming of Effie Gray, the story of the 19th-century art critic John Ruskin and his long-suffering wife, played by Dakota Fanning; Thompson plays the imperious Lady Eastlake and Greg Wise plays Ruskin. The film was stuck in legal purgatory for years while Thompson successfully defended two plagiarism suits brought by American writers. It's a strange film, slow and a little thin, but beautifully filmed and the performances are terrific - especially from Wise, who makes Ruskin's rejection of his wife and adherence to his mother (Julie Walters) skin-crawlingly creepy. It's very British, in lots of ways, full of people failing to say what they think or mean, although, as Thompson points out, the Americans can be just as bad. &quot;They're often very dishonest, especially in my business. 'Oh, yeah, great, you were fabulous!'&quot; The Brits probably have it worse, though. &quot;I think the British can be very twisted about their genuine feelings. Have you read (Edward St Aubyn's) Patrick Melrose novels? Oh my god! Talking of false identities and people's disguises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Thompson's delight, Gaia loved the trip to the Arctic, and found the people on ship deeply sympathetic. They were all ages, all backgrounds, some optimists, some pessimists, which Thompson liked. (She is, unusually for someone promoting a cause, deeply sceptical about the aid world. &quot;I liked the fact that you weren't with a load of people saying, 'We're going to save the planet!' The question of whether it's a form of make-yourself-feel-better tourism I think is a very fair one.&quot;) Gaia, meanwhile, said, &quot;'I've found my tribe.' And I knew exactly what she meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a teenager of roughly the same age, Thompson was &quot;very loud and angry&quot;. In the Guardian's video, her daughter comes across as a thoroughly nice kid. &quot;Well, yeah, let's hope so. She's wonderful and I think she's fantastic. I think the proof will be on the analyst's couch in 30 years' time, if that occurs. I don't think so, though, because I think of Gaia and Tindy as being very much hand-reared. They've been checked, and picked out, like a little garden. They haven't been handed over to anyone. There's a lot of soil work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tindy is Thompson's 27-year-old adopted son, a former child soldier from Rwanda whom she and Wise met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16. He has accompanied her on many aid trips and is now a human rights lawyer. Gaia was just two when he came into their lives, and the two regard each other as siblings, absolutely, she says. &quot;For Tindy, Gaia's incredibly valuable, because she's a proper sister. And he drives her mad and they fight. They fight! Which is brilliant. When that happens, I'm secretly thrilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Cambridge in the early 1980s, Thompson shaved her head and grunged out, as the times permitted. Her feminism was uncompromising and it stayed that way after her hair grew back. It is absurd that, by talking without caveat about sexism, she is considered almost eccentrically radical by the standards of her industry. (She traces the destruction of the Arctic - the fact that we're &quot;fucking the Earth over right, left and centre&quot; - to patriarchal standards set during the industrial age. Most Hollywood actresses would rather die than use the word &quot;patriarchy&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, it does baffle me. I don't understand. When you say, 'But feminism means equal rights for women' - sorry, what's the problem? You think it's done? Then think again and inform yourselves, because it isn't done. Don't be daft about it. So what's the issue? Is it that there have been feminists who have said things that shock and appal you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps other actresses think they won't get jobs. &quot;Well, I would not be in work if that was the case. It's very, very odd. I've worked with some young, brilliant women whom I would consider feminists, who don't like to use the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does she remonstrate with them? &quot;Yes. I say, why? It seems to be out of fashion. Surely it's a bottom line thing that has nothing to do with fashion, one way or another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenting teens, Thompson says, strikes her as much harder than stewarding younger children. She and her oldest friend from university took Gaia and three other teens to the Reading festival last month, whereupon &quot;the most important thing is that they know you're there, but that you can be picked up and used as and when needed. I think people sometimes think, oh, they're teens now, they're up and running. But this is the crucial time; when they're little, they just need feeding and cuddling. But not this later stuff. You have to be around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thinks back to when she was 15, &quot;reading Jackie fucking magazine. Reading articles like How To Find Your Man And Keep Him. I was wading through a huge heap of insidious twaddle.&quot; The insidious twaddle available to today's teens is much more pervasive. Like most sensible parents, Thompson keeps the computer in the kitchen, but you can't police your teen's phone. The sheer weight of sexual imagery to which they are exposed, she believes, means people growing up now &quot;don't have any connection to their own sexuality. It'll be our children who will tell us later: why the fuck didn't you do something about this? Do you know I haven't had an erection since 1989 or whatever?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has Thompson's strength of feeling, her willingness to campaign, interfered with her work? Would she use a film to proselytise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give me an example of a proselytising film. In The Name Of The Father or something?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, except that was a great movie. Could a script light her political fire but still be a bad film? &quot;No, no, no, no, no. I get offered a ton of political stuff, and a lot of the time it's not good enough. There aren't very many films that are truly political and truly great. The Lives Of Others, City Of God. Some of Mike Leigh's are wonderful, and Ken Loach's can be fantastic, but sometimes a bit too proselytising for me. I need to be surprised. It's like reading Victor Hugo's Miserables. I got exhausted by agreeing with him. I thought, yes, I know, it's awful, the poor get shat on.&quot; She chuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was heavily criticised, and called an IRA sympathiser, for In The Name Of The Father, Jim Sheridan's 1993 biopic of the Guildford Four, in which she played defence lawyer Gareth Peirce. And there was criticism when she publicly opposed the first Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of her judgment calls are right, mind you; Thompson added her name to the ill-advised petition in support of Roman Polanski some years ago. &quot;Yes, but then I had to take my name off it. Mike Nichols rang me up and said, sign this, and sent me a documentary about the utterly appalling (judicial) process. Made by a woman. And I thought, OK, well it's a tricky one. Then I spoke to a woman at Tindy's university who said no, rape is rape, and I thought about it and thought, mmm, yeah. Yeah. You're right. And it was such a messed up process of justice, it was rotten. But rape is rape. And you look at what's been going on recently here with Operation Yewtree and it makes your eyes water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaia pops her head round the door, very much following in her mum's sartorial style in DMs and a jacket that would look great on a demo. She is off out for the day. &quot;Are you going to be warm enough, mate?&quot; Thompson says cheerfully. &quot;Take a scarf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She turns back to the kitchen table. Her political interests, she assumes, are tolerated in the US, &quot;because they know I'm going to go away. I'm not going to live there and fiddle with their menfolk. Or indeed their women. I don't know.&quot; And she half-shrugs, as if to say, either way, it doesn't make the blindest bit of difference *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Miners Battle Black Lung, and Bureaucracy'' (editorial, Sept. 8):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I applaud the efforts of Senators Bob Casey and Jay Rockefeller to expedite black lung claims for miners, they should be asking a bigger question: Why do we keep sending coal miners to their death in pursuit of this dirty 18th-century fuel? According to many recent studies, cleaner and safer energy sources like solar, wind and nuclear could provide a viable alternative to our dangerous dependence on coal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll of more than 76,000 miners since 1968 is just the beginning of coal's unacceptable consequence. Add to that the thousands of citizens who die each year from heart and lung ailments caused by coal's toxic emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then add the ultimate risk: the carbon-caused climate disruption that scientists say threatens life on earth. Clearly, the cost of this so-called cheap energy is way too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the senators really want to aid coal miners, they should work to help miners find safer occupations and move America toward clean energy by supporting the new carbon fee and dividend legislation now in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Studies show that such plans will save lives, improve health, grow our economy and cause a rapid shift toward cleaner and safer energy sources. That, too, would be something worth fighting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAY BUTERA Senior Congressional Liaison Citizens Climate Lobby Gladwyne, Pa., Sept. 9, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, black lung disease has been making a comeback, particularly among younger miners. Even so, the coal industry objects to federal rules that would limit workers' exposure to coal dust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miners take significant health risks for high-paying jobs with good benefits. Increasingly, they also face the risk of losing those jobs. As natural gas displaces coal, companies have been laying off thousands of miners. We're also moving away from coal production to reduce risks from climate&nbsp;change. That's a good thing, but we cannot forget the men and women -- like those in my native West Virginia -- who have helped keep the lights on for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress has in the past provided assistance to displaced workers, and it should do so now. Coal states are beginning to see the need to diversify their economies. Even amid disagreements about climate&nbsp;change policy, let's agree that the people who mine our coal deserve a brighter future, too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Pakistan and India are struggling to cope with raging monsoon floods which have killed more than 460 people, displaced nearly a million people, and still threaten many more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakistani military specialists blew up dykes with explosives to divert water from rivers running close to three cities, while Indian authorities admitted that relief efforts had not yet reached about 300,000 people in Kashmir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local people, aid-workers and medical staff in the Indian-administered parts of Kashmir criticised the relief effort, which they called &quot;inadequate and chaotic&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One aid worker based in Srinagar, a city of 1 million people, said the coordination between the Indian military, local authorities and NGOs had been &quot;almost nonexistent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valay Singh, of Save the Children, said that at least 50,000 people were living in community-run relief centres, mainly mosques and Sikh temples. &quot;People who are rescued have next to nothing, as of now. They need shelter, food, medicines, clothes. There's no consolidated list of the rescued people in the relief camps. There is an urgent need to compile lists as it will help in identifying people displaced by the floods and help them in reuniting them with their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 200 people have been killed in Srinagar and bodies have reportedly been seen floating in the streets. Police said some residents had been trapped in the top floors of their homes since heavy rain caused the Jhelum river to surge last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammad Farhan Malik, a volunteer doctor in Srinagar described a chaotic situation in the city. &quot;There are over 20,000 people here (at one large mosque). Most people are suffering from conjunctivitis, stress, gastroenteritis. We fear an outbreak of cholera. We have to be prepared for the worst. There are just eight to 10 doctors working . . . but the government hasn't set up any proper health camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water levels in Kashmir have started to drop, but the extent of destruction in more remote areas remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some villages where everything has been swept away. People are extremely angry, frustrated and exhausted,&quot; said R K Khan, an Indian police official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian air force announced last night that it had been forced to scale back operations after angry survivors pelted helicopters with stones. Most communications networks in Kashmir had failed and only 20% of the population had clean water supplies, reports in India said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jhelum river flows from Indian Kashmir to the Pakistan side, then down into the flat fertile lands of Punjab. The two embankments destroyed by the army yesterday were near the cities of Muzaffargarh and Multan. The new breaches flooded farmland and small villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disaster, caused by heavy rain over the last eight days, has forced more than 700,000 people to flee their homes in Pakistan. Some chose to remain to protect their property and land only to end up being trapped on what few high positions they could find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We sat on roofs for three days waiting for help,&quot; said Allah Wasaee, a mother of 10 children, from a village near Jhang city. &quot;Even the women climbed up into the trees to escape the water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, visited the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir yesterday and told flood victims that his government would do whatever it could to rebuild their damaged homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian and Pakistani leaders offered each other help at the weekend to deal with the disaster, which temporarily diverted attention from fighting along their borders. The crisis is the first humanitarian emergency in India since Narendra Modi took power in India in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two states have fought four wars since winning their independence from Britain in 1947 and tension over Kashmir is a key factor in the mutual hostility. This week, however, violence flared again on the &quot;line of control&quot;, the de facto border splitting Kashmir, as Indian troops shot dead three militants even as flood rescue operations began elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pakistan, hardline Sunni sectarian groups, some with a history of fighting in Kashmir, have rushed to assist families who have fled to relief camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other supposedly banned groups have also been quick to extend support, including the charity arm of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which is led by Hafiz Saeed, a controversial hardline cleric. The group has set up its own camps and has offered food to displaced families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saeed is blacklisted under the UN's international terrorism sanctions and is also subject to a $10m US bounty for his role in the 2008 assault on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Asia experiences monsoon rain from June to September, which are vital for the regional agriculture. But the rain frequently turns to floods, devastating crops, destroying homes and prompting outbreaks of diseases and diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists in Delhi said the government should recognise that floods were getting worse due to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Kashmir floods are a grim reminder that climate&nbsp;change is now hitting India harder,&quot; said Chandra Bhusan, head of the climate&nbsp;change team at the Centre for Science and Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said this year's monsoon rains had killed more than 1,000 people in India alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past year has seen the obstacles blocking action on climate&nbsp;change beginning to crumble. Opposition on scientific grounds looks pretty unpersuasive in the light of what has come from the experts on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change. Their seven-year study states that they are now 95% certain that human activity is a significant and avoidable element in driving climate&nbsp;change around the world. Predicted changes in the climate are now being observed in the most vulnerable countries, confirming the predictive models that have been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion that action on this would have too great an economic cost is likewise looking increasingly shaky. This month the New Climate Economy report will be published by a global commission, including Felipe Calderon, the former president of Mexico; Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever; the economist Nicholas Stern; and Chad Holloway, the chairman of the Bank of America - as well as a substantial number of finance ministers from around the world. This report will show that action on climate&nbsp;change is entirely compatible with economic growth in almost all countries and that the economic benefits, both short and long term, will outweigh the costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will reinforce the findings of a report published last October by a group of financial heavyweights outlining the threat to US businesses of doing nothing in the face of climate&nbsp;change. Risky Business - by former US treasury secretaries Hank Paulson, Robert Rubin and George Schultz; Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York; and the billionaire investor Thomas Steyer - argued, purely on economic grounds, that ignoring the challenge is folly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another stumbling block that is also beginning to disappear is political inertia. Politicians, working with short-term election cycles, have constantly been tempted to kick this particular can down the road. But President Obama, having spoken powerfully about the need for action, is now backing up his rhetoric with legislation limiting carbon emissions from US power plants. There are similarly encouraging signs in China, where lethal levels of atmospheric pollution, especially in cities, have at last goaded the government to start to move in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With actors who have traditionally dragged their feet taking the lead, and with the urgency for action in developing nations beyond any serious doubt, it is now those who have traditionally been more proactive - European nations in particular - who need to step up to the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hope is that the New York summit of world leaders on 23 September, at which climate&nbsp;change will take centre stage, will be the next major prompt to agreed action. Hosted by the UN secretary general, this meeting will show the real leaders in responding to climate&nbsp;change, and should kick-start negotiations ahead of the crucial UN climate summit in Paris in December next year which must decide on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. David Cameron became prime minister on the promise of &quot;Vote blue, go green&quot;. He promised to lead the &quot;greenest government ever&quot;. His presence and actions at this month's summit will be a significant test of these commitments and aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral case for action is clear. It is those suffering the most who carry the least historic responsibility for our situation. The wealthier industrialised nations have the power to act and secure a safe world for today's poorest and tomorrow's children. Christian Aid is soon to publish a report by Susan Durber examining the links between theology and climate&nbsp;change, in which it will be made very plain that the call for climate justice is something that echoes clearly the challenges found in the biblical prophets to a complacent and short-sighted society. As Durber says: &quot;Prophets are sometimes unpopular and can be ridiculed by those who have much to lose if people really were to open their eyes. But they are those who consistently, and without fear, speak what they believe to be the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed from our politicians is leadership that takes the long view and breaks free of the tight cycle of calculated electoral advantage - a calculation that often misses the issues that most directly affect everyone's wellbeing. We're starting to see this with the publication of a paper from the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change which outlines the need for, and the benefit of, an ambitious climate deal at the Paris meeting. But as Christiana Figueres, the leading UN spokesperson on climate&nbsp;change, said in a speech in St Paul's Cathedral last May, we need to see action already in place this year if the deal in 2015 is to be strong enough: we need the groundwork laid, and we need clear signs that the political will is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate summit in New York offers the perfect opportunity for our leaders to show that there is indeed a sensitivity to the kind of prophetic vision that rouses us from complacency, and a will to secure the future of our children and grandchildren.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTTAWA -- Some Canadians, particularly Prime Minister Stephen Harper, have long been taken with the story of the disastrous attempt by the British explorer Sir John Franklin to sail and map the Northwest Passage. So it was not surprising that Mr. Harper took it upon himself to announce on Tuesday that the sixth attempt by Canada's government to locate wreckage from Franklin's doomed voyage had been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers from Parks Canada, the national parks agency, found one of the two ships abandoned in 1848 by Franklin's 129 crew members, all of whom ultimately died. The discovery, made on Sunday by a remotely controlled underwater vehicle, was also a confirmation of sorts. The ship's wreckage was found near King William Island in the territory of Nunavut, the place where the Inuit, the region's aboriginal people, have long said the ships were crushed by sea ice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For more than a century, this has been a great Canadian story and mystery,'' an unusually animated Mr. Harper said. ''I'd say it's been the subject of scientists and historians and writers and singers. So I think we have a really important day in mapping together the history of our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the disappearance of the expedition's crew became almost an obsession of Victorian England, prompting 32 unsuccessful search missions between 1848 and 1859, it has not loomed large in modern Canadian life. But Robert Huebert, a political scientist the University of Calgary in Alberta who studies circumpolar issues, said that Arctic nationalism is, along with hockey and the War of 1812, a topic of particular interest to Mr. Harper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is one of the three things that really gets him going,'' Mr. Huebert said. ''This is a tremendous find for Canadian Arctic nationalism. It acts as an element of nation building. It's who we are, we see ourselves as a northern people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Harper has made of point of traveling to the Arctic each summer, and this year he briefly participated in the quest for the lost ships. But both the annual Arctic excursions and the search, which was partly financed and aided by a variety of private groups, are driven by political strategy as much as the prime minister's personal passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thinning of Arctic ice as a result of climate&nbsp;change has opened the possibility that the Northwest Passage, which doomed Franklin and his men, will become a major shipping route between Europe and Asia. Mr. Harper has vigorously asserted Canada's claim that the route lies within Canadian waters. The United States, however, contends that the route is an ''international strait.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of ice in the Arctic may also make mining and oil and gas development in the area feasible, leading Canada and other nations to begin an extensive effort to map the extended continental shelf in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly publicized effort to find the ships coincided with budget cuts that forced Parks Canada to reduce some services and access to some national historic sites, leading to criticism from Mr. Harper's political opponents. Similarly, environmentalists and native groups have accused the prime minister of ignoring the sometimes-profound negative effects of climate&nbsp;change on the north during his annual visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1858, a search party found two brief notes left by the crew describing how the ships had become trapped in ice, Franklin's death and the survivors' plans to find a path to a trading post on Hudson's Bay. More recent archaeological work on the remains of the crew suggests that lead poisoning from food cans as well scurvy and tuberculosis killed many of them. Other researchers, however, dispute the lead-poisoning theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear which vessel the recently discovered wreckage was from: H.M.S. Erebus or H.M.S. Terror. Yet John Geiger, the chief executive of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, one of the groups that participated in the search, said that images showed that the ship appeared to be very well preserved. He said he expected that divers would eventually recover artifacts that further detail the expedition's ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's not just that the ships are interesting historical artifacts,'' he said. ''They hold answers to questions that have long been unanswered.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this summer, I was invited to write an essay on humanity's troubled relationship with the changing atmosphere for a special issue of Audubon Magazine centered on the Audubon Society's comprehensive new report on birds in a changing climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is now published online and in print and has a range of excellent features, including &quot;How Climate&nbsp;Change is Sinking Seabirds&quot; by Carl Safina, &quot;Why U.S. Forests Are Fueling Europe&quot; by T. Edward NIckens, &quot;Rethinking How We Think about Climate&nbsp;Change&quot; by Elizabeth Kolbert, and a stunning photo essay on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, my article, &quot;How We Ran Out of Airtime,&quot; considers the current human-generated carbon dioxide buildup in relation to a tumultuous period of atmospheric disruption triggered by another life form some 2.4 billion years ago.&nbsp;Here's the opening section (I've included links that weren't preserved in Audubon's online version):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be no surprise, first of all, that humanity is taking its time absorbing and confronting what's going on. Our interactions with climate, for far more than 99 percent of history, ran in one direction: Precipitation or temperatures changed, ice sheets or coastlines or deserts advanced or retreated, and communities thrived, suffered, or adjusted how or where they lived. Only a couple of decades have passed since people outside of a tiny community of scientists began to grasp that the human-climate relationship, in measurable but still subtle ways, now runs in two directions....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are different from other life-forms that have become planet-scale powerhouses. Take blue-green cyanobacteria, organisms that began flooding the atmosphere with oxygen some 2.4 billion years ago. Some earth scientists call that atmospheric jolt the great Oxygen Catastrophe,&nbsp;because the buildup of oxygen was toxic to most other species at the time. And yes, you could step back and say there's not much of a difference between our carbon binge and that oxygen outburst. Except those mats of photosynthesizing slime weren't looking up at the sky, measuring and marveling at what they'd done. Through science, we are. With awareness comes responsibility, at least in theory. I'm pretty sure cyanobacteria are not self-aware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily it's still too early to describe the ongoing buildup of human-generated greenhouse gases as the great Carbon Dioxide Catastrophe. Climate scientists say there's still &quot;space&quot; in the climate system for the CO2 from burning roughly another 500 billion tons of carbon before long-lasting shifts in temperature, weather patterns and sea level guarantee a daunting future for our species and many of our companions on this planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I argue for moving away from a &quot;solve the problem&quot; approach to global warming to a more realistic long-term framing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[H]ow do we develop a sustainable, two-way relationship with the atmosphere and climate? How do we limit warming and gird ourselves smartly for the future? First, it would help to conceive of global warming less as a problem to be solved and more as a legacy issue to be consistently addressed. Too often we've heard calls to &quot;seal the deal&quot; (on a binding treaty) and &quot;solve the climate crisis&quot; in ways that imply this is the task of a single president or generation. A more realistic view is that we need a new relationship with energy to go with our evolving new relationship with climate. Addressing both sources of emissions and sources of societal and ecological risk is something to do as routinely, and passionately, as we work on poverty reduction and health care. It took a century to get deep into the fossil era; it will take decades to get out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closing section centers on a them&nbsp;I've explored before on Dot Earth - the value of a diverse array of approaches to climate-friendly energy progress:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;super wicked&quot; complexity of the greenhouse challenge, as first described by the young climate analyst Kelly Levin and some colleagues in 2007, guarantees that a mix of approaches-the &quot;silver buckshot&quot; of Bill McKibben, the veteran climate writer and campaigner-is needed. In action as in evolution, diversity is adaptive. McKibben has mostly shaped&nbsp;his 350.org movement&nbsp;around confrontation, for example, attacking big oil companies and pressing university trustees and politicians to pull fossil fuel investments. But the group has also staged &quot;work parties&quot; in which communities gather together to make such environmentally friendly changes as planting trees and erecting solar and wind energy installations. At the same time, innovators like the Caltech chemist Nate Lewis focus on pushing forward photovoltaics and other energy technologies. Entrepreneur Billy Parish of Mosaic is devising new investment models to foster expanded solar panel use. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Secretary-General, has wisely approached the world's interlaced climate and energy challenges along two tracks, pairing climate-smart diplomacy with expanded sustainable energy access for the world's still un-electrified billions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most exciting signs of a change in thinking came in a powerful essay written for Yale Environment 360 by two former Democratic senators, Tim Wirth and Tom Daschle-long champions of such top-down tools as laws and treaties. They laid out a new approach to climate progress that fits our variegated world:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the time has come for the international community to alter its collective climate strategy, cease the search for the impossible all-encompassing top-down agreement-described unattractively as &quot;burden sharing&quot;-and instead encourage an approach that builds on national self-interest and spurs a race to the top in low-carbon energy solutions. This would change the psychology of the climate&nbsp;change issue from one of burden to opportunity, and change the likely outcome from one of hand-wringing about failure to excitement about tangible action to build a better world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their call replaces the unachievable quest of building a binding treaty with an inclusive and sustained search for productive paths on energy and the environment. And as that kind of approach spreads-from international diplomacy to household decisions to career choices made by students-I see solid prospects that we can win this race with ourselves. We can move from awareness to responsibility to meaningful action and pass on a planet to the coming generations that, while unavoidably bearing our footprint, remains something beautiful to behold.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of North America's bird species, from common backyard visitors such as the Baltimore oriole and the rufous hummingbird to wilderness dwellers such as the common loon and bald eagle, are under threat from climate&nbsp;change and many could become extinct, a study has found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If present trends continue, 314 species face dramatic declines in population as warmer temperatures push birds out of their traditional ranges. Ten states and Washington DC could lose their state birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard to imagine that we are not going to lose some of these birds permanently,&quot; said Gary Langham, chief scientist for the National Audubon Society and leader of the seven-year study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scale of disruption we are projecting means that many familiar sounds, and many familiar birds that people may see in their backyards and on their walks, that help them define a place for them, may no longer be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are much bleaker than a 2010 US government report on the fate of North America's birds, which suggested ocean and Arctic birds would be the most vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change. An updated version of that report is due out today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Audubon researchers found that on present trends 126 of the 588 bird species in the study would lose more than half of their traditional ranges and would go into decline by mid-century. Another 188 species would lose their range by 2080.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maryland would lose the Baltimore oriole, the mascot for the baseball team as well as the state bird, which would no longer be able to breed in the mid-Atlantic. Louisiana's brown pelican is under threat and Minnesota would lose the common loon, its state bird, which would be unable to survive in the continental US. Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont and Washington DC would also lose their state birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bald eagle, once considered a success story for American conservation, could lose 75% of its range by 2080. Some birds, such as the trumpeter swan, would lose virtually all of their range towards the end of the century, according to the projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study found 274 birds would maintain or increase their ranges under climate&nbsp;change. However, even if the birds find room to expand, they could face renewed competition from other species, as well as new predators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers drew on more than a century of observations from birdwatchers as well as a 40-year historical record from the US Geological Survey, combining the data with 17 climate models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Audubon's chief executive, David Yarnold, described the findings as a &quot;call to action&quot;. The group is calling for cuts in carbon emissions, as well as measures to preserve habitats and give the birds a better chance of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langham said the study did not take into account other factors associated with climate&nbsp;change such as rising sea levels, which can flood marshes and other bird habitats with saltwater; drought, which can kill off insects and other food sources; or extreme storms. As a result, it was likely to be a conservative assessment of the threats facing birdlife, he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: As we approach the New York climate summit, there are serious questions about whether the two degrees of warming limit is acceptable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has released a timely analysis on economic growth and carbon emissions, which makes the point that there is a &quot;disconnect between the global climate negotiations aiming for a 2&deg;C limit on global warming, but national pledges may only manage to limit it to 3&deg;C, and current trajectory actually on course for 4&deg;C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was released in the lead up to the United Nations climate&nbsp;change summit in New York, which will also be the focus of global climate rallies, to hammer home the message that &quot;taking decisive action to avoid the extremes of climate&nbsp;change is a pre-condition for sustained economic growth&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PwC analysis shows that in order to keep to the&nbsp;2&deg;C limit on warming, decarbonisation of the global economy would need to occur at &quot;five times the rate&nbsp;currently achieved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the analysis, Australia topped the chart for the second year running in decarbonisation rates for 2013, recording a 7.2 percent reduction in carbon emissions. China had a decarbonisation rate of 4 percent, while many major economies&nbsp;including the USA, India, Germany and Brazil increased their carbon intensity. This was largely due to increased coal consumption and a &quot;slower pace of change to renewable energy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the New York climate summit, delegates will be discussing how to achieve the&nbsp;2&deg;C limit on global warming. This is the same limit on global warming that was described in 2009 at the Copenhagen summit as a &quot;suicide pact&quot;. With less hyperbole, outspoken climate scientist James Hansen warned that &quot;international negotiations for two degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As climate activist and 350.org founder Bill McKibben pointed out in his confronting 2012 Rolling Stone article, the&nbsp;warming we have already locked in, about 0.8&deg;C, is already causing &quot;far more damage than most scientists expected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While policy analysis like that produced by PwC is welcome, in that it hopefully emphasises to business and political leaders the urgent need for rapid economic transformation, it also continues the &quot;myth&quot; that&nbsp;2&deg;C is an appropriate limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;2&deg;C target, as pointed out recently by climate activist and author David Spratt, is a &quot;very unsafe target&quot; and is &quot;more appropriately considered as the&nbsp;boundary between dangerous and very dangerous climate&nbsp;change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists and climate policy experts have been saying for this for years. For example, back in 2006, the Independent reported that dangerous climate&nbsp;change would be &quot;likely to be unstoppable&quot; if atmospheric carbon concentration exceeded 400 parts per million. In July 2014, the concentration was 399 and exceeded 400 in April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stabilisation at two degrees warming is not a policy for a safe climate. A Royal Society paper by&nbsp;Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows in 2008 points out that &quot;The framing of climate&nbsp;change policy is typically&nbsp;informed by the 2 degrees C threshold; however, even stabilizing at 450 ppmv CO2e [parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent] offers only a 46 per cent chance of not exceeding 2 degrees C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They further point out that the&nbsp;2&deg;C limit is the result of very optimistic scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, and that to achieve &quot;stabilisation&quot; would require&nbsp;an unprecedented step&nbsp;change in the global economic model and the rapid deployment of successful CO2&nbsp;scrubbing technologies&quot;. IPCC scenarios have been criticised as systematically underestimating the pace and severity of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Glenn Scherer wrote in 2012, we are facing&nbsp;unstoppable, &quot;non-linear &quot;light switch&quot;&nbsp;moments when the climate system abruptly shifts from one paradigm to another&quot;, where global warming becomes locked in and self-reinforcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates to New York, and leaders around the world, must recognise the stark reality: two degrees is unacceptably and dangerously inappropriate&nbsp;as a mitigation and adaptation target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having reached the 400 parts per million threshold this year, it is clear that we are struggling to even keep within&nbsp;the&nbsp;2&deg;C warming limit.&nbsp;Most of the world, including Australia under the Abbott government, is continuing with &quot;business as usual&quot;. Worse, most countries are giving mere lip service to the&nbsp;the&nbsp;2&deg;C limit, with many national pledges limiting warming to&nbsp;3&deg;C. As George Monbiot pointed out last year, governments are collaborating &quot;in the disaster they publicly bemoan&quot;. A report, &quot;Paris 2015: getting a global deal on climate&nbsp;change&quot;, released in the lead up to the New York summit by the Green Alliance UK (including Greenpeace&nbsp;and&nbsp;the WWF) underlined this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissions reduction pledges for the period up to 2020 have been made by&nbsp;more than 90 countries but, added together, these are, in the words of the&nbsp;UN, &quot;far from sufficient to close the emissions gap.&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an appetite for action on climate&nbsp;change. But global warming has&nbsp;not been reduced to safe levels. The world is currently on track for&nbsp;warming of at least 3 to 4&deg;C by 2100, which would have far reaching&nbsp;consequences for food security, fresh water availability, and the frequency&nbsp;and intensity of storms.15 At this level of climate&nbsp;change, the efficacy of&nbsp;adaptation strategies would be severely limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These statements are largely backed up by the PwC report. PwC is hardly a radical green organisation, yet it makes the point that the world's nations have missed decarbonisation targets for six years in a row and that &quot;we are way behind&quot; avoiding even&nbsp;the&nbsp;2&deg;C &quot;suicide pact&quot; target. It states that decarbonisation must occur at a rate of 6.2 percent per year, a global rate that is unprecedented. Global investments in fossil fuels continues to outstrip investment in renewables, largely due to global policy settings that favour fossil fuel extraction and consumption. Many of these investments will result in stranded assets as the impact of global warming becomes worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Australia, to seriously and substantially contribute to avoiding 2&deg;C in warming, we must reduce our carbon emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020. This reduction goal is the stated bi-partisan policy of both the Abbott government and the Labor party; although&nbsp;the Abbott government's &quot;direct action&quot; policy has no chance whatsoever of meeting even the lower bi-partisan target of 5 percent reductions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A challenge for us all leading up to the New York summit is that the&nbsp;2&deg;C target&nbsp;rhetoric is likely&nbsp;sabotaging policy negotiations&nbsp;that would meaningfully tackle global warming.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HighWaterLine made from blue chalk snaking through city shows which parts would be submerged by rising sea levels</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A blue chalk line - heralded as the largest art work ever commissioned in the UK - has begun weaving its way around a city's streets to raise awareness of what could happen if global warming goes unchecked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HighWaterLine project is designed to show which parts of Bristol are at risk of disappearing under water if sea levels rise and more extreme weather batters the coast of England's west country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next fortnight, hundreds of residents are expected take to the streets to create the 32-mile line aimed at giving an idea of what could be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept was dreamed up by the US artist Eve Mosher, who marked out a similar high water line in New York. Last year, Miami residents also created a 26-mile line highlighting the historic buildings they believe are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristol has been chosen because it is regarded as a vulnerable place for flooding because of its proximity to the Bristol Channel, which has the world's second-highest tidal range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those behind the project accept the line is not precise and does not necessarily represent one huge deluge but it highlights the areas that are at risk of flooding. They have used data from the Environment Agency and Bristol city council and have worked with Bristol University's school of geography to try to make sure that the artwork is backed by science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project has been commissioned by art organisation Invisible Dust, which works with artists on environmental issues. Over the last six months it has run workshops and talks about the risks the city faces and what could be done to mitigate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isobel Tarr, project manager at Invisible Dust, said: &quot;It's been wonderful to see people from all parts of the city come together and start conversations about positive solutions to this problem so that Bristol can be a more resilient city in the face of change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosher's original HighWaterLine involved the artist herself marking out a line 10ft (3m) above sea level around the coast of New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When subsequently parts of the route were flooded after hurricane Sandy in October 2012, people began to see her artworks as innovative ways to visualise the future impacts of climate change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Baltimore oriole will probably no longer live in Maryland, the common loon might leave Minnesota, and the trumpeter swan could be entirely gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are some of the grim prospects outlined in a report released on Monday by the National Audubon Society, which found that climate&nbsp;change is likely to so alter the bird population of North America that about half of the approximately 650 species will be driven to smaller spaces or forced to find new places to live, feed and breed over the next 65 years. If they do not -- and for several dozen it will be very difficult -- they could become extinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four Audubon Society scientists who wrote the report projected in it that 21.4 percent of existing bird species studied will lose ''more than half of the current climactic range by 2050 without the potential to make up losses by moving to other areas.'' An additional 32 percent will be in the same predicament by 2080, they said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most threatened species are the three-toed woodpecker, the northern hawk owl, the northern gannet, Baird's sparrow, the rufous hummingbird and the trumpeter swan, the report said. They are among the 30 species that, by 2050, will no longer be able to live and breed in more than 90 percent of their current territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Common sense will tell you that with these kinds of findings, it's hard to believe we won't lose some species to extinction,'' said David Yarnold, the president of the National Audubon Society. ''How many? We honestly don't know. We don't know which ones are going to prove heroically resilient.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the birds just move? ''Some can and some will,'' Mr. Yarnold said. ''But what happens to a yellow-billed magpie in California that depends on scrub oak habitat? What happens as that bird keeps moving higher and higher and farther north and runs out of oak trees? Trees don't fly. Birds do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's predictions are based on both United Nations estimates of the effects of climate&nbsp;change in 2050 and 2080, and on two voluminous surveys of birds: the Audubon Society's own Christmas bird count, which thousands of volunteers have worked on for decades, and a more general annual survey of breeding birds. The latter was started by the federal government in 1914; amateur birders began the Christmas bird count a few years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The notion that we can have a future that looks like what our grandparents experienced, with the birds they had, is unlikely,'' said Gary Langham, the study's chief author, in an interview. The impact of climate&nbsp;change, he said, will not just harm birds already considered endangered -- it is as likely to decimate birds that have robust populations now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This whole other threat tends to undo successes we've had in the past,'' Dr. Langham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Root, a Stanford University biologist who specializes in the impact of climate&nbsp;change on the geographic distribution of species, said she found the conclusions in the Audubon survey disturbing indeed. ''If we are losing as many species as this is saying, what's going to happen to all the insects they eat?'' she said. ''There are going to be winners if you move a species out of a region, and these winners might be mosquitoes and spiders.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, Dr. Root said: ''Maybe other avian species will grow in abundance and take up the space. We don't know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Smithsonian Institution are scheduled to release their annual state of the birds report, which is also expected to describe declines in bird populations and threats from changing ecosystems. Laury Parramore, a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a statement on Monday that the Audubon Society's work ''provides a tool to help predict future bird distribution and ranges'' that will help guide her agency's conservation plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birds could feel the impact of a changing climate in different ways. Drought in Southern California is blamed for a sharp drop in breeding among California raptors, perhaps because a lack of water is killing the insects and small rodents they feed on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puffins, whose reintroduction off the Maine coast had largely been a success story for the Audubon Society, have shown signs of declining both off the American coast and in countries like Iceland and England, perhaps because of climate-driven changes in the ocean food web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every species of plant and animal is very well-tuned to what it does for a living,'' Dr. Langham said. ''A bird in the desert can't go to the boreal forest. Everything about every organism is finely tuned.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the bright side, Dr. Langham said, his report shows that many species will continue in their current abundance and, mostly, their current locations: American robins, red-tailed hawks, western scrub jays, western meadowlarks, northern cardinals and northern mockingbirds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at least one species, popular among poets and jilted lovers, is expected to flourish as warming takes its course, Dr. Langham said. ''You want to know what climate&nbsp;change sounds like?'' he asked. ''It's the sound of a mourning dove -- their climate potential is going to increase.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other species may or may not be able to adapt. For example, the brown pelican, a Gulf Coast resident, could move northward and inland, Dr. Langham said, adding, ''But really with any bird that shows new climate space opening up, it is far from certain that any bird is going to capitalize on that potential.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Langham called for a revised conservation strategy that focuses not only on species in immediate trouble, but those likely to suffer as climate forces them out of their current homes. The Audubon report, he said, is ''a framework to focus on which species are predicted to be sensitive and where they are likely to move, and importantly, where they are likely not to move.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Yarnold of the Audubon Society said that birds were resilient, but that climate&nbsp;change will test their limits. ''We just don't know whether they'll be able to find the food sources and the habitat and cope with a new range of predators,'' he said. ''Maybe they'll all be incredibly hardy and find ways to survive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added, ''That doesn't seem likely, given, one, the number of birds affected, and two, the pace at which these things are happening.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FALL RIVER, Mass. -- In May 2013, two environmental activists piloted a lobster boat close to the vast pile of coal at the Brayton Point Power Station, the hulking plant that overlooks this industrial inlet near the border between Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the tiny boat, the two men -- Jay O'Hara, 32, and Ken Ward, 57 -- dropped anchor and for a day blocked a freighter with a 40,000-ton shipment of coal, and they were charged with conspiracy, disturbing the peace and other violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were scheduled to be tried on Monday, and they planned to deploy an old legal argument called the necessity defense: They had no choice but to act because the consequences of climate&nbsp;change are so dire. But instead of a jury trial, the major charges were dropped or downgraded by the district attorney, who said, in effect, that he was sympathetic to the defendants' point of view on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Sutter, the Bristol County district attorney who dropped the conspiracy charge and downgraded the others to civil infractions, strode out of the Fall River Justice Center clutching an article on climate&nbsp;change written by the environmentalist and author Bill McKibben, who was prepared to testify as an expert witness for the defense. Mr. Sutter told more than 100 climate activists who had gathered outside that he had reached his decision in part because of environmental concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced,'' Mr. Sutter said. ''In my humble opinion, the political leadership on this issue has been sorely lacking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is by no means the first time prosecutors have downgraded charges for civil disobedience, but Mr. Sutter's strong words about climate&nbsp;change surprised many of the advocates gathered outside the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it was very bold; I don't know of another politician -- maybe including Al Gore -- who has said it as quickly, as forthrightly, at the point of decision in something under his purview,'' said Mr. Ward, who, like Mr. O'Hara, still has to pay $2,000 in restitution to settle the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sutter, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the Ninth District in 2012, describes himself as a ''fervent environmentalist,'' and said a trial could have put him in an awkward position. Despite his personal beliefs, he said, he was not sure the defense team would meet the legal burdens required for the necessity defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I would have been in a position of saying, 'Well, I legally don't think you have a necessity defense, but this is a crisis,' '' said Mr. Sutter, who says he is interested in running for another office in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim DeChristopher, a Harvard Divinity School student who spent nearly two years in federal prison after he disrupted an oil and gas auction in Utah in 2008, was in Fall River on Monday, and he said he hoped Mr. Sutter's action would encourage other elected officials to take bolder action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We rarely ask people in official positions to make the kind of risks that activists take,'' Mr. DeChristopher, 32, said. ''What D.A. Sutter did today is to show that there's no reason for that.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later this month world leaders will gather in New York for a historic summit on climate change. This is an opportunity to inspire key decision-makers to act in the face of a growing climate crisis that threatens almost every aspect of our lives. Politicians all over the world cite a lack of public support as a reason not to take bold action against climate change. So on 21 September we will meet this moment with unprecedented public mobilisations in cities around the world, including thousands of people on the streets of London. Our goal is simple - to demonstrate the groundswell demand that exists for ambitious climate action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From New York and London to Paris, Berlin, Delhi and Melbourne we'll demonstrate demand for an economy that works for people and the planet; a world safe from the ravages of climate change; a world with good jobs, clean air and water, and healthy communities. There is only one ingredient that is required: to change everything, we need everyone. The abolition of slavery. The end of apartheid. The spread of universal suffrage. All proof that the future is ours to shape. We just need to step out and claim it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As pressure grows from students who want to see their schools use financial clout to address environmental issues, Yale University's investment office wrote to its money managers asking them to assess how investments could affect climate&nbsp;change and suggesting they avoid companies that do not take sensible ''steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter, from David F. Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, stopped short of asking managers to sell shares in companies with a ''large greenhouse footprint.'' Instead, Yale asked them to ''discuss with company managements the financial risks of climate&nbsp;change and the financial implications of current and prospective government policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Swensen, who has run the $20.8 billion endowment since 1985, said in an interview that ''while divestment is a blunt tool, considering the economic costs of greenhouse gas footprints is more subtle, influencing in a positive or negative fashion the risk and return profile of every investment position, existing and potential.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it is a valuable experiment,'' he added. ''We will see how it plays out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy is part of a program just announced at Yale that includes a $21 million capital investment for energy conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yale's endowment, the second largest in the country after Harvard's, is closely watched. Mr. Swensen was a pioneer in the use of alternative investments, including hedge funds, and established a stellar record. In recent years, alternatives have fared poorly relative to other asset classes. Nevertheless, for the decade ending June 30, 2013, Yale and Columbia led university endowment returns with an average annual return of 11 percent, according to Cambridge Associates. Returns for the most recent year will be released this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on universities to respond to the issue of climate&nbsp;change has evoked responses across the country. A few, including Unity College in Maine, have chosen to divest themselves of fossil fuel stocks. Others have opted not to alter their investment portfolios, arguing that, among other factors, sales would have little effect on the target company and would end any dialogue between the university and the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike some universities, Yale does not manage its money internally, instead allocating it to outside investment groups. Still, Yale could have sought to sell shares in certain companies because it has separate accounts that would allow for that. Mr. Swensen noted that the university divested its holdings in South Africa and Sudan years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Fine, founder of Fine Capital Partners, a $1.2 billion hedge fund that invests largely for endowments, said she found the approach ''innovative as an opportunity to discuss the impact with companies that have some direct connection to the fossil fuel issue as well as raising the awareness of companies that are not directly involved.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister campaigned on climate change, jobs and infrastructure, while promising to oversee women and Indigenous issues. How did he fare?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andie Fox: Tony Abbott, the prime minister of women</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in September 2013, I argued that Tony Abbott appointing himself women's minister might not be such a bad thing. He wouldn't make landmark progress for women, I predicted, but he'd give the portfolio some muscle in the cabinet room, and given his reputation on gender issues, he'd have something personal at stake in the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since that time Abbott has managed to exacerbate his &quot;woman problem&quot;. The infamous wink caught on camera during talk-back radio, when the caller revealed she does phone sex work, was a particularly insensitive look from Abbott given she was also telling him about the hardships she faces from his budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the budget, it's one that disproportionately hurts women. The harshest aspects for women include cuts to family payments that squeeze single parent families, lower increases to pensions, and freezing superannuation contributions as well as cutting the low-income super rebate. Older women are especially vulnerable to these kinds of changes given they retire with an average superannuation of almost half that received by men.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction of a draconian GP co-payment also disproportionately affects women, as they have more GP visits than men. Changes to the repayment of university fees appear to put a greater interest repayment load on young women going on to have children. And critically, Abbott's signature women's policy, the enhanced paid parental leave scheme has now been deferred with no clear signal of return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible wins for women under Abbott? I'm struggling here, but the fact that control is incredibly centralised in the Abbott government and that his office is led by female chief of staff, Peta Credlin, makes this an interesting case in power to observe on a personal level. And whether you find Abbott sincere or not, it was still noteworthy that he declared himself feminist on International Women's Day this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Andie Fox is a freelance writer and commentator</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Quiggin: Tony Abbott, the prime minister of infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defining feature of the Abbott government, from civil liberties to education policy and beyond, is that it is &quot;all culture war, all the time&quot;. To understand the government's line on any issue, it is sufficient to look at the tribal enemies who are being punished or the tribal allies who are being rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is just as true of Abbott's pledge to be &quot;the infrastructure prime minister&quot; as of Hockey's &quot;lifters and leaners&quot; budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;infrastructure prime minister&quot; does not, as one might suppose, imply a generalised enthusiasm for nation-building investment projects. Rather, it is necessary to distinguish between &quot;good&quot; infrastructure, benefitting ordinary Australians as Abbott perceives them, and &quot;bad&quot; infrastructure, foisted on the public by un-Australian groups such as environmentalists, trade unionists and the Labor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most obvious piece of &quot;bad&quot; infrastructure is the NBN, too closely identified with Kevin Rudd to be anything but anathema. Unsurprisingly, the government has commissioned a hatchet job on the project, based on the unsurprising premise that, if we don't discover any new uses for the Internet, our existing infrastructure, with a modest upgrade will suffice to meet our needs. More generally, with any project inherited from the previous government, the only question is whether to appropriate it, and claim the credit, or dump it and present it as an example of wasteful Labor spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In transport infrastructure, the distinction between &quot;goodies&quot; and &quot;baddies&quot; is obvious. Cars are good, and public transport (at least in urban areas) is bad. Public transport hits all the tribal enemy buttons for Abbott: liked by environmentalists, a largely unionised workforce and a service that primarily benefits Labor voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divide is even more extreme in relation to energy. Despite the sovereign risk involved, the government looks set to dump the renewable energy target, with the aim of transferring vast amounts of wealth to coal-fired electricity generators. Along with bad economics, the government has engaged in the kind of scaremongering normally found on the fringes of the environmental movement, holding repeated inquiries into the totally spurious health risks of wind turbines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the nature of its tribal enemies and supporters, the government's culture war approach to infrastructure inevitably means that its thinking is stuck in the 20th century. Renewable energy, the Internet and the decline of car culture, all notable trends of the 21st century here and elsewhere, are totally alien to the middle-aged and older men whose prejudices form the basis of this government's policy. Sadly, here as elsewhere, tribal enmity is not a good basis for policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; John Quiggin is an Australian laureate fellow in economics at the University of Queensland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celeste Liddle: Tony Abbott, prime minister of Indigenous affairs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I think of Tony Abbott's time in office, the only way I can describe his efforts is &quot;unsettling&quot;. The fears I held of him taking on the Indigenous Affairs portfolio have unfortunately been cemented and then some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd argue that whilst holding this portfolio, Abbott actually has set out to infuriate the Indigenous community. He has openly celebrated mainstream ideals whilst further entrenching Indigenous marginalisation. Abbott's recent suggestion that the defining moment of this country was the arrival of the First Fleet was indicative of this mentality. In one small comment he ignored several millennia of preceding history not to mention the consequences this invasion has had on Indigenous people. Combined with his &quot;unsettled&quot; comments, I wonder if our prime minister thinks Aboriginal people were all in suspended animation prior to 1788.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Abbott has said though is the tip of this iceberg. The $500 million worth of cuts handed down to Indigenous affairs in the federal budget have been disastrous. I cannot see, for example, that anything positive is going to come of draining resources out of Aboriginal Legal Services when we are still incarcerated at exorbitant rates, nor Family Violence Prevention services when Aboriginal women are still 45 times more likely to experience family violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott also doesn't seem to be interested in engaging with diverse Indigenous voices. Abbott defunded the democratically-community-elected National Congress and put in place a hand-picked Indigenous Advisory Council. He has stated that the Indigenous community wish to be recognised within the Australian Constitution yet has ignored the diversity of Indigenous voices on this issue. Abbott seemed to endorse Andrew Forrest's review of Indigenous employment and economic development yet many peak community organisations want a parliamentary inquiry into this document because it failed to allow the opportunity for submissions from the Indigenous community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this has been his first year as Indigenous affairs minister, then I loathe to think what his next two years will bring.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver Milman: Tony Abbott, the environment prime minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his detractors, Tony Abbott's stance on climate&nbsp;change has been set in stone since 2009, when he infamously said the science of human-caused warming was &quot;crap.&quot; Abbott has used his first year in power to negate this image as a climate&nbsp;change denier, not so much by aggressively supporting the overwhelming science, but by attempting to sweep the issue off the agenda entirely. He got his landmark victory in July, scrapping the carbon price after successfully framing the issue as one of household power bills rather than how Australia must avoid the worst ravages of climate&nbsp;change. Australia became the first country to scrap a carbon price and, with the Coalition's widely unloved Direct Action alternative yet to be legislated, the nation is in the unhappy position of having no specific policy to lower carbon emissions. The rise in emissions since the carbon price's repeal may be a sign of a regressive trend to come. The idea that economic growth can only be achieved through a regrettable but necessary increase in emissions appears firmly entrenched. Climate&nbsp;change is not on the agenda in the upcoming G20 gathering in Australia, to the surprise of other nations, with Abbott stressing that economic growth and job creation must be a priority. Abbott got into an unhappy tangle with the science of climate&nbsp;change in the first months of his prime ministership, dismissing the link between rising temperatures and bushfires and accusing the chief UN climate official of &quot;talking through her hat&quot; when she pointed out the correlation. The CSIRO and the department of environment clearly link climate&nbsp;change to extreme weather, although the latter seems to have modified its thinking. Abbott has, in fairness, recently reigned in such comments on climate&nbsp;change, consistently stressing that he trusts the science. In July, he admitted that some of his previous statements on the top were perhaps &quot;a little over the top.&quot; &quot;My position is that climate&nbsp;change is real, humanity does make a contribution and it's important to have strong and effective policies to deal with it and that's exactly what the Coalition's Direct Action policy is,&quot; he said. How effective Direct Action is, and whether a reluctant senate will even legislate it, will be key variables in how effective Abbott's government is in proving it does take climate&nbsp;change seriously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: A year after his election, what does the Abbott government's environmental record look like? The answer is not pretty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Sunday marks a year since Tony Abbott was elected.&nbsp;The prime minister&nbsp;is riding low in the&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;as the least popular prime minister in twenty five years, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;net dissatisfaction rating of minus 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's little&nbsp;doubt that Mr Abbott's unpopularity is driven by many things;&nbsp;he was unpopular even before his election in 2013. The litany of broken promises could be one reason. His attempts to&nbsp;unravel the Australian social compact, mostly encapsulated in his&nbsp;first budget,&nbsp;could be another.&nbsp;Judging by the fights he has picked, Abbott has decided he needs enemies like a thirsty man needs water: the environment, unions, Russia, asylum seekers, the unemployed, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contributing factor in my view is that Tony Abbott and his government have not just failed to responsibly steward Australia's natural heritage, but has actively treated the environment as an enemy. Several of the attacks were promises that Mr Abbott decided not to break, but others are surprises that were sprung only after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The active, purposeful attacks by Abbott against Australia's natural heritage is not just a political issue that has contributed to his low standing with the public, but have real impacts that may last for decades. This negligence is reckless and endangers our air, water, soil&nbsp;now and for future generations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been many potentially disastrous decisions made by the Abbott government since the 2013 election on 7 September. Here's my top ten worst decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Repealing the carbon price</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeal of the carbon price was perhaps the single biggest act of negligence and misanthropy from the Abbott government to date. It is quite simply a betrayal of current and future generations, and sets Australia back more than a decade. The globe is moving towards pricing carbon, whether through emissions trading or through shadow pricing schemes. The Clean Energy Future Act, while not perfect, had the essential elements needed to decarbonise the economy. Since the abolition of the carbon price, carbon pollution emissions&nbsp;has increased:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the year to August 2014, emissions were 1m tonnes higher when compared with the year to June 2014. This is equivalent to an increase of 0.8% in emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This disappointing but predictable increase&nbsp;follows reductions in carbon emissions&nbsp;from 2012-13. Needless to say, carbon pollution is the primary cause of dangerous global warming. Unfortunately, the replacement policy proposed by the Coalition,&nbsp;&quot;direct action&quot;, is a sham&nbsp;that could only be proposed by a&nbsp;government that believes global warming is a hoax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Winding back, freezing or abolishing the renewable energy target</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the 2013 election, the renewable energy target was a bi-partisan policy originally introduced by the Howard government. The target would see 20 percent or 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy generated by 2020. Leading up to last year's election, both Tony Abbott and environment minister Greg Hunt made clear commitments that they would keep, unchanged, the renewable energy target. On 19 June 2013,&nbsp;Hunt said on Sky News:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree on the national targets to reduce our emissions by five per cent by 2020. We also agree on the renewable energy target. And one of the things we don't want to do is to become a party where there is this wild sovereign risk where you are, where businesses take steps to their detriment on the basis of a pledge and a policy of Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The renewable energy target was responsible for increasing the amount of clean, renewable energy in our electricity grid, the creation of&nbsp;thousands of jobs from new energy projects, and downward competitive pressure on energy prices. Upon his election, Mr Abbott appointed a review panel chaired by climate denier Dick Warburton, who has proposed the scheme be dramatically cut back. If Abbott accepts these recommendations, it would effectively shut down&nbsp;Australia's renewable energy industry future. The beneficiaries of any freeze or reduction in the renewable energy target would be the fossil fuel energy producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Abolishing the Climate Commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Climate Commission was created to provide independent, accurate and relevant information to the public about global warming. The commission's abolition was announced just a few weeks after Abbott's election, when Greg Hunt abruptly called the&nbsp;commission's&nbsp;chief&nbsp;professor Tim Flannery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major challenge facing policy reform on global warming is the virulent and hardened propaganda campaigns run by climate deniers. There is a strong need for accurate information to help better inform the Australian public about the risks of climate&nbsp;change, and to correct the misinformation that is given airing in mastheads like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Australian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A well informed public is inherently meritorious, even more so when it concerns an issue as complex and contested as climate&nbsp;change policy. It is exceptionally disappointing that the government abolished the Climate Commission, and doing so has not altered the facts of global warming or silenced the likes of Tim Flannery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Attempting to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Renewable Energy Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both these organisations, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency were created to assist in the rapid commercial development of renewable energy projects. The&nbsp;Renewable Energy Agency finances research and development for renewable energy projects, and currently supports around 180 projects worth $1&nbsp;billion, many of which are in regional areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;Clean Energy Finance Corporation alone has financed billions in renewable and energy efficiency investments; the Abbott government's argument is that these investments &quot;crowd out&quot; private investment and that the investments it does make are &quot;highly speculative&quot;. Both criticisms have been refuted by the corporation itself, and far from crowding out private investment, it has actually spurred it, attracting &quot;A$2.90 from private funds for every A$1 it has invested in projects&quot;. According to strategic management professor John Matthews:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem facing most renewable energy projects is that financial institutions are too conservative to back their projects. But if a project is &quot;proofed&quot; by the CEFC then it becomes much more attractive to conventional finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government's abolition attempts for both the&nbsp;Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency were blocked in the senate by Labor, the Greens and the Palmer United Party &quot;coalition&quot; (including Ricky Muir). Nevertheless, the Abbott government's ideological opposition to clean energy and the jobs it creates is openly apparent with their brutish attempts to force the finance corporation to cease its investments before legislation was even introduced to parliament to abolish it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Keeping fossil fuel subsidies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government declared that the &quot;age of entitlement&nbsp;is over&quot; when Joe Hockey said that &quot;everyone in Australia must do the heavy lifting&quot;. This clearly excluded fossil fuel and mining companies, the main beneficiary of enormous and unneeded subsidies.&nbsp;Despite the severe cuts in the federal budget targeting everyday people, the&nbsp;government decided to keep $10 billion per year&nbsp;in subsidies to fossil fuel companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These handouts&nbsp;take the form of direct subsidies, cash, tax breaks and publicly funded infrastructure. The most egregious is the diesel fuel rebate, primarily used by mining companies to the tune of $2 billion per year. Highly&nbsp;profitable, mostly foreign-owned mining companies pay just $0.06c per litre for fuel, compared to the $0.38c per litre that everyday people pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just mining companies. The major fossil fuel companies get tax-payer funds for their oil, coal and gas projects, which over the next four years will add up to more than $4 billion. This includes exceptionally favourable depreciation laws for assets like drilling rigs, which costs Australians money and helps fossil fuel companies make their massive profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Wrecking the Great Barrier Reef</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Great Barrier Reef is one of the truly wondrous natural wonders of the world, and the Abbott government decided to approve the expansion of a coal terminal near the reef. The reef is not only at risk of ocean acidification and extreme weather, but industrial development and shipping along the reef puts it under considerable pressure. There is a real possibility that the reef has already been irreparably damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it now appears the worst elements of the Abbot Point coal terminal, which involved &quot;the dumping of three million cubic tonnes of dredge spoil in the marine park area&quot; may not proceed, the threat of climate&nbsp;change and environmental problems from increased shipping of coal exports remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Tearing up the Tasmanian forest deal and attempting to de-list the Tasmanian World Heritage forests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a generation, Tasmania was divided between&nbsp;pro-logging and conservationists, with conservationists opposing logging of old-growth forests. After many years of negotiation, the major conservation groups came to an agreement with the forestry industry, ensuring World Heritage protection for large parts of Tasmania's forests, and a path for Forest Stewardship Council certification for the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his election, Tony Abbott tried to have the United Nations de-list Tasmania's 74,000 hectares of World Heritage listed forest, and the recently elected Liberal state government has also committed to tearing up the forest deal. The UN rejected the Abbott government's attempts at a meeting this year in Doha, with a delegate saying &quot;accepting this delisting would set an unacceptable precedent&quot;. These actions show that the Abbott government is attempting to reignite the bitter conflict between industry and conservationists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth noting that the Tasmanian&nbsp;forest industry supports the existing deal, suggesting that Abbott's actions have been driven by anti-environmental ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Reviewing the marine national reserves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Labor government significantly expanded Australia's marine national parks, growing the commendable work done under the conservative Howard government. The marine network is now being reviewed by a panel, with pro-fishing groups expecting the current marine park process to be &quot;suspended&quot;. As we have seen in other places, reviews under the Abbott government are often stalking horses to provide cover for&nbsp;more extreme agendas, and the risk is that Australia's network of marine reserves will be&nbsp;weakened beyond repair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue has sadly received relatively little coverage by major mastheads, although Fairfax's Bianca Hall did cover the original decision in December 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Attempting to handover environmental powers to the states</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The referral of environmental powers to the states would be a betrayal of Australia's natural heritage, under the paltry guise of removing &quot;green tape&quot;. The cumbersomely named&nbsp;Environmental Protection and Biodiversity&nbsp;Conservation&nbsp;Act creates requirements for federal approval for major projects. The referral proposal would see the federal government hand over approval powers to state governments, many of whom are hopelessly conflicted or incapable of assessing major projects adequately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the referral would leave Australia's environment at the mercy of major mining and fossil fuel interests. The furphy of &quot;green tape&quot; was dreamed up by conservative business interests to undermine legitimate protections for the environment and communities. What's more, handing these powers is an abdication of the federal government's responsibility to steward our national heritage, many of which cross state boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Defunding the environmental defenders office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small network&nbsp;of community legal centres exists to empower local communities to protect themselves and their environment. They do public interest work, like running cases to ensure that governments abide by existing conservation laws, or protecting endangered species. These environmental defenders offices were funded through federal government grants (like most community legal centres) but upon the election of the Abbott government, George Brandis, the new attorney general, defunded them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is disappointing because it reduces the ability of communities to hold the government and big business to account and to protect their local interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 Creating an unsafe and underpaid &quot;green army&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;green army&quot; is an election promise to recruit around 15,000&nbsp;volunteers to opt into working on environmental projects. In lieu of payment, participants receive an allowance. In addition to there being doubts to the merit of the environmental projects the &quot;green army&quot; will undertake, the participants of the program lack basic employment protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the program is to provide work experience and training to volunteers aged 17-24. The program has been legislated to ensure that volunteers do not receive social security payments but instead receive an allowance, paid by the program service provider (which are companies or other organisations that are contracted by the federal government). Participants are not characterised as employees, and are therefore denied rights and protections taken for granted by other workers, including health and safety laws, workers compensation, superannuation, leave, unfair dismissal, and anti-discrimination protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real shame of this program is that it puts vulnerable young people in potential danger without any real rights or protections just to provide a green-wash for the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who must admit to being still something of a beginner when it comes to buying (and using) vacuum cleaners, the glee with which the Daily Mail and some other papers have rounded on Brussels for banning machines rated above 1,600 watts has been shocking. Stories about the ban have prompted a &quot;stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners&quot;, with online sales up by as much as 400%, and reports of customers &quot;stockpiling two or more high-power models&quot;. Can Mail readers' houses really be so dusty that they need a turbo-charged, Jeremy Clarkson-approved machine to clean their floors? Can a vacuum cleaner be a good reason to leave Europe? Do people really have enough money to stockpile vacuum cleaners?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that this is a tabloid-induced summer storm that has little to do with cleaners and everything to do with political vacuums - and the right of the right to be as thick as it likes. The idea behind the - albeit Orwellian-sounding - Ecodesign for Energy-Using Products and Energy Labelling directives is to make the world's designers come up with machines that need less power, make less noise and cost less to run. Which sound pretty reasonable ambitions as long as the new machines continue to do their jobs efficiently. All vacuum-cleaner makers, including Sir James Dyson, as well as most fridge, washing machine and telly makers, have known about this directive for years and have quite easily adapted their models. Just a few Brits, it seems, demand the right to ignore labels showing how much money they can save and to carry on using obsolete, super-powered machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as Ute Collier, a former green energy campaigner who now works with the UK parliament's climate&nbsp;change committee, says, wattage does not equate with cleaning performance; design is of key importance. She notes that the German equivalent of Which?, Stiftung Warentest, has found that of the 20 top-rated products on the German vacuum cleaning market, only one would be banned by the new rules. Which?, on the other hand, says that of seven cleaners awarded &quot;best buy&quot; status since January 2013, five have motors of more than 1,600w. &quot;Personally, I've had a Which? best buy 'eco' vacuum cleaner for some time which, with a 1,200W motor, provides the same performance as a 2,000W cleaner,&quot; says this true European.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wider reason behind the horrible-sounding directive, of course, is to reduce Europe's overall energy consumption to save money, import less fuel from unreliable countries such as Russia and reduce climate-change emissions. The new regulations are expected to save 19 terrawatt hours (TWh) of electricity by 2020. That's not much in overall terms, but it is more electricity than all 178 million people in Nigeria used in 2012, or more than what was generated by several British power stations and all our windfarms last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the designers and bureaucrats hoping to reduce electricity use and consumer costs cannot keep up with the massive growth in the sheer numbers of computers, tablets, mobile phones, &quot;smart&quot; TVs, game consoles and other electronic gadgets and machines that are now in use worldwide. Last year, electronic gadgets alone were estimated to use around 600TWh of electricity - equivalent to the output of 200 medium-size coal-fired power plants. This might have been excusable if manufacturers had made them with the best available technology, but the UN's International Energy Agency (IEA) reckoned they used three times more electricity than necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More scarily, the amount of electricity we now use on consumer electronics and household goods is thought by the IEA to be growing by about 6% a year - or doubling every decade. In a report in July, the agency warned that if design standards were not changed, then within five or so years we may need as many more power stations to work them as presently exist in Canada and Germany combined - along with all the dams, pylons, mines and ugly infrastructure that will be needed to build them. The deal is simple. If energy efficiency isn't forthcoming fast, then expect power cuts, environmental destruction and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next few years, the tabloids' vacuum-cleaning readers could become apoplectic. Next on Brussels' list to have their power reduced by 2017 are smaller electrical appliances such as hair driers, toasters, power tools, blenders and even air conditioning units in cars. All these gadgets will be expected to reduce the electricity they use by 20-30%. That should keep the designers busy - and Mail readers irate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: How is the global organised labour movement responding to climate change?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end November 2013, Philip Jennings, the general secretary for the global union federation UNI Global Union spoke at a climate conference in Toronto. His message was simple: &quot;there is nothing more important facing humanity than the dangers of a warming planet. We have no time to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Jennings, who is from Welsh mining stock, the threat of global warming amounts to a &quot;class war&quot;, with the world's poorest people paying the highest price for the carbon production of the richest. &quot;While billionaires prepare safe havens for themselves and their money,&quot; he said, &quot;workers will bear the cost of climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For global unions like UNI Global, the climate struggle is starting to merge with the struggle for workers rights, especially in the third world. &quot;For unions, employment and decent work is core business and climate&nbsp;change is not employment friendly,&quot; said Jennings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangladesh is a country where climate action is at the forefront of significant struggles by organised labour. As a nation, it is facing enormous risk from extreme weather and sea level rise, both exacerbated by global warming. In fact, Bangladesh&nbsp;is considered the country most vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change, according to&nbsp;Maplecroft's 2013 Climate&nbsp;Change and Environmental Risk Atlas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With global brands investing heavily in vulnerable growth markets to take advantage of the spending power of rising middle class populations, we are seeing increasing business exposure to extreme climate related events on multiple levels, including their operations, supply chains and consumer base,&quot; said James Allan, one of the authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cyclone Phailin demonstrates the critical need for business to monitor the changing frequency and intensity of climate related events, especially where infrastructure and logistics are weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The massive workforce that textile sweatshops that feed the world's major clothing brands rely upon come from farmers fleeing swamped regional areas. When they're not busy evacuating their homes due to flooding, the workers in Bangladesh's slums are&nbsp;at risk of workplace accidents in largely unregulated factories, construction sites and sweatshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For unions, this poses a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming is clearly having major impacts on working people; not just in their workplace, but their personal lives and in their communities. The catastrophic&nbsp;Cyclone Phailin hit India in October 2013 killing 36 and uprooting over 550,000 people;&nbsp;Cyclone&nbsp;Mahasen hit Bangladesh&nbsp;and Burma in May 2013 causing&nbsp;one million people to be&nbsp;evacuated and killing 14. The workers in low-lying areas are living and working in ground zero for climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As organisations committed to improving the working lives of their members, what priority or response should unions and global unions give to climate&nbsp;change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the question I asked Sharan Burrow, the president of the International Trade Union Confederation, the global union's peak representative body, in July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrow was the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions before being elected to the ITUC in 2010, and Australian unions under her leadership played a key role in working with environment groups and supporting national climate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global unions response has been to launch an international campaign to support climate action. &nbsp;The objective, says Burrow, is &quot;to mobilise union members in the lead up to Paris and Peru&quot; and &quot;achieve a just transition focusing on skills, jobs and technology&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last IPCC reports were shocking,&quot; Burrow said, &quot;and the picture is clear. We need to decarbonise our societies and economies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the greatest climate&nbsp;threat facing the 170 million workers represented by the ITUC is displacement. &quot;Workers in places like Africa are already experiencing climate displacement. Thousands of agriculture workers in Africa are being uprooted by drought and natural disasters,&quot; she said. &quot;Over the next 25 years, the destruction of regional industry through climate displacement is a bigger risk than the closure of industries due to other economic reasons.&quot; The desertification in parts of Africa is not just seeing industries wiped out, but entire communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global union agenda is to support actions limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, with the central mission being the just transition. &quot;The just transition must start now,&quot; Burrow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITUC research suggests that even a small investment in renewable energy and related industries could create tens of millions of jobs, as well as safeguard industries like steel, concrete and aluminium by cleaning them up. &quot;Aluminium has a future,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just the energy mix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can transition,&quot; Burrow said,&quot; if we tackle fear head on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing unions like UNI Global Union and their national affiliates, representing service workers such as finance workers, garment makers, call centre workers, post officers and cleaners&nbsp;are hostile multi-national corporations, many of whom are at the cutting edge of union-busting tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennings, in an&nbsp;interview with The Guardian, explained the scale of the challenge that global unions like UNI face:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center of the world's union busting industry is the US. Companies adopt an almost paramilitary approach to place fear, threaten livelihoods and dismissal of staff. These are iron fist tactics used by household names from Walmart to T-Mobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour standards and rights in many countries, including the US, are often scant or non-existent; often they simply serve to give legal punitive powers to employers.&nbsp;With multinational corporations prepared in some nations to take, as Jennings says, &quot;paramilitary&quot; approaches to prevent the unionisation of their workforce, and working people in developing nations facing serious injury, death or deportation, unions&nbsp;face a tough choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although global warming is increasingly affecting workers, unions often have to focus on &quot;traditional&quot; industrial matters like safety or wages. Climate campaigning can sometimes be portrayed&nbsp;as a luxury, but with the UN World Meteorological Organization predicting a &quot;climate hell&quot; and more disasters and uncertainty, union leaders like Burrow and Jennings warn climate&nbsp;change is union business and that climate&nbsp;change would mean the biggest industrial change of our generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time for a peaceful transition is starting to run out,&quot; said Jennings. &quot;The world must cut global emissions by 50% compared to 1990 levels and leave more than half of fossil fuel reserves in the ground to give us a chance of limiting rising temperatures to 2 degrees. It means that the world needs to achieve zero emission societies by 2050.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burrow says the biggest barriers to change is lack of political will. &quot;Our leaders lack the political will to change, and can be dominated by self-interested corporations, who support populist political parties who want to scare people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global union climate motto is &quot;no jobs on a dead planet&quot;. The role of unions globally is to empower working people, said Burrow. &quot;We need to mobilise for an ambitious global agreement. There is no Planet B.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c13">(The Work in a Warming World conference brought together unionists, environmental groups and academics to debate the impact of global warming on workplaces and workers. You can download&nbsp;the talk&nbsp;I presented&nbsp;at the conference here.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Davey, the energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary, will announce today that the zero carbon Britain bill will be among five green laws that the Lib Dems would demand in any future coalition negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill would include a decarbonisation target for electricity generation, an expansion of the powers of the Green Investment Bank and the banning of electricity from &quot;unabated&quot; coal - that is energy generated without using technology to capture and store the resulting carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed law follows a commitment from the Department for Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change last month to close a loophole that could have seen public money invested in old coal power stations.

Bush is generally toeing the Republican Party line: He is attacking the federal health care overhaul, decrying abortion and championing gun rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is environmental policy that will be under his purview if, as expected, he wins his race to be the state's next land commissioner in November. Last week, in his first in-depth interview on the topic nearly a year and a half into his campaign, the son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, nephew of former President George W.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, the younger Mr. Bush thinks climate&nbsp;change is a serious threat to Texas, though he stopped short of definitively attributing a hotter and drier state to human activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think people can agree that there has been warming in recent years,'' Mr. Bush, a 38-year-old energy consultant, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the vulnerability of the Gulf Coast to storms, which he said is worsened by climate&nbsp;change-related problems like sea-level rise and coastal erosion, ''honestly keeps me up at night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Bush joins his fellow conservatives in railing against the federal government, including the Environmental Protection Agency, he did not go so far as to echo many Republicans' calls to abolish the agency -- or their blanket assertions that its recently proposed climate regulations would be a disaster for Texas. ''Regardless of your politics,'' Mr. Bush said, ''the E.P.A. is regulating coal and ratcheting down its overall usage in our electricity grid.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of that and concerns about global warming, Mr. Bush said, Texas should move away from coal-fired power and ''transition to a natural gas-based energy economy and then, in the long term, renewables.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are those views anathema to the coal lobby, a major backer of conservative Republicans nationwide, they are also decidedly more moderate than those of other ambitious Republicans here. Both Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott, Mr. Perry's likely successor, have blasted the recent federal climate rules and questioned whether carbon dioxide emissions are dangerous to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush clearly has a keen sense of how politically charged environmental issues are: Two days after the interview, he released a statement attacking President Obama for seeking a global climate agreement ''without the consent of the U.S. Senate'' and accusing the E.P.A. of ''excessive regulation.'' Some Tea Party activists in Texas say they see through that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's probably not stoppable because of his name, period,'' said Julie McCarty, the president of the NE Tarrant Tea Party, who did not support Mr. Bush during the primary. ''But I think he will find resistance from the Tea Party all the way through.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush said he identified with the Tea Party, but that he had ''said to myself, to my family, to my friends from Day 1 that I was always going to run based on my principles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garry Mauro, who served as Texas' land commissioner from 1983 to 1999 and was one of the last Democrats elected to statewide office, said he was ''shocked'' to learn of Mr. Bush's thoughts on climate&nbsp;change and its impact on the state. He attributed them to the fact that Mr. Bush did not have to worry too much about Republican politics at the moment: He breezed through the party's primary last spring, easily defeating a Tea Party challenger. And he faces a long-shot Democrat, former Mayor John F. Cook of El Paso, in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, whose mother was born in Mexico, has talked often of the need to usher more young people and Hispanics into the Republican Party, and he is widely believed to have higher political ambitions than land commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's young. He wants to be governor. You know, he wants to be somebody who can bridge these gaps,'' said Heather Taylor-Miesle, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Action Fund, the political arm of the advocacy group that drafted the Obama administration's most recent climate regulation proposal. If he is elected, she said, by the end of Mr. Bush's first term, ''a lot of the stalwart, more conservatives will be quite old, and they'll be dwindling. He's trying to create a model for the 2020 election.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush said he was not ready to think about future political campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Land Office, which the Texas land commissioner leads, is not the primary agency that oversees the state's energy generation mix. If elected, however, Mr. Bush would be managing the revenue generated from oil and gas drilling on millions of acres of state land -- money that goes into a public education fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous land commissioners have started or expanded programs that promote natural gas-powered vehicles, made some of the state's first wind power purchases, and installed renewable energy generators on public land to diversify the education fund's income stream -- all efforts that Mr. Bush said he was committed to continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is also involved in protecting the state's 367-mile Gulf Coast, which has become increasingly vulnerable to sea-level rise, coastal erosion and storm surges that scientists say are all exacerbated by climate&nbsp;change. Noting that he was born in Houston, which is both home to Texas' energy industry and susceptible to hurricanes and rising seas, Mr. Bush suggested that if Texas increased its spending on coastal protection, it could get more federal matching dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For every dollar that the state spends, we can get $3 from the feds, roughly speaking,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to a program in which the state and federal governments partner on coastal issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kind of state-federal collaboration does not sound like a Tea Party talking point. And Mr. Bush's views on environmental policy, in fact, seem to better reflect those of his relatives. His father, Jeb Bush, has made public statements on the advantages of natural gas from a carbon emissions standpoint and dealt with coastal concerns as Florida's governor. And his grandfather was an early actor on pushing for global climate treaties more than two decades ago. ''I think there's a lot to build upon,'' Mr. Bush said of that family legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison DeFoor, who worked as an environmental adviser to Jeb Bush while he was governor of Florida, said he was not surprised to hear of the younger Mr. Bush's opinions, adding that his father chose data over ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can just tell you that I would be surprised if the fruit fell very far from the tree,'' Mr. DeFoor said, ''and the tree here is data driven.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind, solar and other renewable power capacity grew at its strongest pace last year and now produces 22% of the world's electricity, the International Energy Agency said yesterday in a report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than $250bn (&pound;150bn) was invested in &quot;green&quot; generating systems in 2013, though the speed of growth is expected to slacken, partly because politicians are becoming nervous about the cost of subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria van der Hoeven, the executive director of the IEA, said governments should hold their nerve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Renewables are a necessary part of energy security. However, just when they are becoming a cost-competitive option in an increasing number of cases, policy and regulatory uncertainty is rising in some key markets. This stems from concerns about the costs of deploying renewables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;Governments must distinguish more clearly between the past, present and future as costs are falling over time. Many renewables no longer need high incentive levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather, given their capital-intensive nature, renewables require a market context that assures a reasonable and predictable return for investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hydro-electric power and other green technologies could be producing 26% of the world's electricity by 2020, the IEA said in its third annual Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report. They are already used as much as gas for generating electrical power, it points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the total level of investment in renewables is lower now than a peak of $280bn in 2011 and is expected to average only $230bn annually to the end of the decade unless governments make increasing policy commitments to keep spending higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth rate for installing new windfarms and solar arrays is impressive but the IEA believes it is not enough to meet climate&nbsp;change targets, triggering calls in Brussels from green power lobby groups for Europe to adopt tougher, binding targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Wilkes, the deputy chief executive of the European Wind Energy Association, said: &quot;The IEA report hits the nail on the head when it comes to ambitious national targets for 2030. Not only is a 27% target too low but it doesn't oblige member states to follow through. Europe's heads of state need to agree in October on a binding 30% renewables target if real progress is going to be made to improve Europe's energy security, competitiveness and climate objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Energy Agency - a Paris-based agency established to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries - says that in Brazil, Chile and South Africa onshore wind is a preferred option over new fossil-fuel plants such as coal or gas. Onshore wind, despite being the most economic of the renewable power technologies in Britain, is still opposed by some members of the Conservative party, while offshore wind remains controversial because of its high installation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New figures released yesterday by the industry body Energy UK show wind provided a little over 4% of Britain's power generation in July compared with 42% for gas, 24% nuclear and 17% for coal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A new literature of drought may be emerging &amp;#8212; one that harkens back to the past, but also warns of an uncertain future. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do what we can to make it rain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So writes Sterry Butcher in her Texas Monthly meditation on West Texas drought. We do what we can, it seems, and we talk about what we've done, and how little it yielded. Rain is something humans were worrying about in Biblical times, and likely long before. But the long dry spell in the West has re-focused many Americans' attention on water, and on what happens when there's not enough. And a new literature of drought may be emerging - one&nbsp;with room for stories that recall&nbsp;the past, but also for&nbsp;the possibility of trouble on a scale we've never seen before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Ms. Butcher on drought superstition:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A thunderstorm that glowers only a mile or two distant provokes the crossing of fingers and messages sent heavenward to help steer the rain this way. It's considered lucky to wash your car in such a circumstance, or hang out the laundry, to entice - or dare - the rain to arrive. No studies exist to show the effectiveness of such charms, but they can't hurt.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on drought conversation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At an Alpine Cowboys baseball game this summer, I sat near two ranchers commiserating about the weather. 'It's so dry I about can't stand it,' the first fellow said. The other fellow nodded. 'When the mesquite starts to die, that'll be it,' he said. 'If that happens, I'm rolling it up and we're done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take out the reference to studies, and much of this could apply a hundred years ago - take out the cars and baseball and you could make it a&nbsp;thousand. And indeed, a lot of what's written on drought today harkens back to an earlier era. At San Diego Magazine, Clare Leschin-Hoar remarks on how little we still know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the National Weather Service uses everything from a variety of atmospheric models to weather balloons and drone planes to gather information, scientists still can't predict precisely when a region will get rain, or how much. That means water officials need to constantly plan for what's ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Magill of Climate Central writes about a surprising consequence of the California drought, under the very Biblical-sounding headline &quot;Epic Drought in West is Literally Moving Mountains.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at The New Republic, Jeffrey Ball writes that &quot;the scary statistics of California's drought read like a latter-day version of the 1930s Dust Bowl crisis.&quot; He notes that &quot;whether climate&nbsp;change is at play is a question on which scientists disagree.&quot; But this question seems to hang over much recent writing on drought. At the very least, some writers&nbsp;may be starting to look at drought as a sign that we need to change our relationship to water, and to the earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there's a kind of visceral panic that occurs in people when suddenly water seems to be unavailable,&quot; Scott Slovic, a professor of English and co-editor of the anthology &quot;Literature and the Environment,&quot; told Op-Talk. &quot;We're inspired to try to hoard water, to fill our bathtubs. Water is one of the essential supplies that we're supposed to have in our homes should there be any kind of&nbsp;disaster.&quot; When we see droughts like the one in California, he added,&nbsp; &quot;we begin to worry on a visceral, profound level that maybe there's something we didn't quite bargain for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writers like Craig Childs,&nbsp;Ellen Meloy and Marc Reisner have tried to get readers to take water more seriously, he said: &quot;The literature has attempted to make us revalue what is truly a precious resource.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while writers have long been interested in the desert - &quot;some of the oldest tropes in world literature have to do with the power of dry places&quot; - the way they understand drought and dry landscapes may be changing.&nbsp;In the late 20th and early 21st century, Mr. Slovic argued, writers have begun to challenge the &quot;idea that the boundaries of the desert are fixed. I think we increasingly have a sense that aridity moves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees Mr. Childs, for instance,&nbsp;as advancing the &quot;notion that the American desert is not just in a specific location. Many different, unexpected regions of America and other parts of the world can easily become desert, and have perhaps been desert historically&quot; - a conception of &quot;the fluid, moveable desert, of uncertain climatic conditions that could result in water shortages for short periods or immensely long periods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Houser, a professor of English and the author of &quot;Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fiction,&quot; also sees a change. She traces it through the work of the novelist Leslie Marmon Silko, author of &quot;Ceremony&quot; (1977) and &quot;Almanac of the Dead&quot; (1991). &quot;In 'Ceremony,'&quot; Ms. Houser told Op-Talk in an email, &quot;drought drives a healing narrative: The protagonist, like the land, goes from a state of sickness to one of health.&quot; But in &quot;Almanac of the Dead,&quot; &quot;drought is pervasive, and one individual's actions aren't going to reverse it.&quot; Indeed, &quot;the picture Silko paints is apocalyptic; a local drought heralds global catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent discussion of climate&nbsp;change, Ms. Houser argued, has led contemporary writers to depict drought as a sweeping problem that's beyond any one person's capacity to solve. Whether literature will motivate readers to solve it, though, is an open question. &quot;'Consciousness' is not the same as 'action,'&quot; she said. &quot;The gap between these positions is often huge, even for the most stalwart environmentalist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some writers, she added, have examined this gap, and &quot;emotions like anxiety and wonder that widen or shrink it.&quot; Richard Powers's 2006 novel &quot;The Echo Maker,&quot; she said, &quot;teaches readers about the destruction of sandhill crane habitat in Nebraska and so raises awareness, but, in another plot about a neurological disease, it also shows that the mind is astonishingly complex. We might feel wonder and awe at the natural world and want to protect it, but there are psychological and social obstacles obstructing the path from wonder to care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Slovic sees, if not action, then at least rising concern. &quot;Climate cycles are not absolutely fixed and predictable,&quot; he said, &quot;and that may be the great lesson of the era that we're living through right now. Whether we believe in human-caused planet-wide changes or whether we believe that these are natural cycles, I think all of us in the early 21st century have this sense of a kind of basic uncertainty about how conditions are changing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's noticed a growing desire to find ways to adapt to these changes: &quot;The more nimble we can be, the more lightly we can live on the planet, I think the more able we will be to adjust to various shifts that we see occurring every day right now and that are likely to continue to occur in the future, and I see this reflected in the literature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't yet know how to make it rain. But increasingly, we may be talking about what to do when the rain doesn't come.                       </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Davis of the University of California, Davis, and Robert Socolow of Princeton (best known for his work dividing the climate challenge into carbon &quot;wedges&quot;) have written &quot;Commitment accounting of CO2&nbsp;emissions,&quot;&nbsp;a valuable new paper&nbsp;in&nbsp;Environmental Research Letters showing the value of shifting from tracking annual emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants to weighing the full amount of carbon dioxide that such plants, burning coal or gas, could emit during their time in service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes sense because of the long lifetime of these plants once built - typically 40 years or so - and the long lifetime of carbon dioxide once released. (I'd love to see some data visualization experiments on this idea from Adam Nieman, building on his work showing the volume of daily CO2 emissions from cities and the like.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Davis's &quot;video abstract&quot; (the transcript is appended at the end of this post, along with a rich discussion of the paper's findings and implications):[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]The opening section of the paper is remarkably clear and is worth posting here (minus footnotes and the like): </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each year, governments and firms estimate and report CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, and their efforts to slow climate&nbsp;change are measured against these annual emissions. Ultimately, though, the magnitude of warming we experience will not be determined by emissions in any one year, but by cumulative CO2 emissions. Thus, climate scientists and energy-economic modelers have developed hundreds of plausible scenarios of future emissions and used them to identify emissions pathways that might achieve climate policy goals. Such scenarios are powerful tools for connecting emissions and warming to trajectories of population growth, economic development, and energy use. However, these trajectories are constrained by tremendous socio-economic inertia (e.g., existing energy, transport and built infrastructures) that limits the rate at which CO2 emissions can be reduced and climate&nbsp;change avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Davis et al [ background ] quantified an important component of socio-economic inertia by estimating the future emissions expected from all existing fossil fuel-burning infrastructure worldwide, naming these 'committed' emissions. That paper provided a single data point (commitments as of 2009), but lacked the context perhaps most important to policymakers: how these committed emissions have changed over time. Here we provide that context. We show that, despite international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, total remaining commitments in the global power sector have not declined in a single year since 1950 and are in fact growing rapidly (by an average of 4% per year 2000-2012).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual 'commitment accounting' that we demonstrate here offers policymakers an opportunity to evaluate historical trends and to quantify the long-term consequences of current actions in a new way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Research Web has posted &quot;Why our carbon-dioxide emissions are like credit-card debt,&quot; which explains how it grew out of earlier work by Davis and others (Davis, Caldeira and Matthews, Science, 2010). This quote from Davis is particularly helpful:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things that makes climate&nbsp;change such a difficult problem is that it lacks immediacy,&quot; Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine, told environmentalresearchweb. &quot;It's going to have huge impacts in the long run, but its effects on our day-to-day lives seem small. The way we've been tracking carbon-dioxide emissions reinforces this remoteness: the annual emissions we monitor are small relative to the cumulative emissions that will cause large temperature increases. The alternative we present, what we call commitment accounting, helps by quantifying the long-run emissions related to investment decisions made today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sought reactions from a host of energy and climate analysts, kicking things off with this query and thought (some email shorthand is cleaned up):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are probably aware of &quot;Commitment Accounting of CO2 Emissions,&quot; a valuable new Socolow/Davis paper (building on&nbsp;Davis, Caldeira, Matthews, 2010).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the&nbsp;near-term and enduring benefits of electric power expansion&nbsp;in developing countries, the other long-term effect of expanded coal-powered generation is accrued wealth and economic growth (along with&nbsp;health costs if they are dirty plants, of course). You could call it a&nbsp;gigawatt-hours&nbsp;commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It'd be interesting to visualize all of this side by side with the emissions commitment in some way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think this emerging form of emissions accounting provides a valuable way to show how the growing coal (and natural gas) greenhouse-gas emissions commitment will play out, but - because of the competing social and economic values embedded in that extracted energy, along with the&nbsp;equity argument&nbsp;poor countries use against established fossil-powered industrial giants - I'm not sure it leads to a more effective strategy for cutting those emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd love to include your thoughts on this, including links to relevant background that bolsters your points.... On complex issues the best way to pinpoint &quot;reality&quot; is through discourse. As in celestial navigation, the more &quot;lines of position,&quot; the tighter the resulting area on the chart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Please excuse the acronyms below. For now, please use Google to find definitions. I don't have time at the moment to include explanatory links.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Green, an energy-focused economist at McGill, was first to reply:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without taking anything away from the importance of the Davis-Socolow contribution, your suggestion that we should also look at the benefits of the electricity generated is, in my opinion, dead on. The world as a whole (especially the emerging/developing country component) is going to require increased energy consumption for the foreseeable (and likely more distant) future. That that energy, however produced, provides enormous benefits cannot be denied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important question is how the world's huge and growing energy requirements are going to be met. Hoffert et al (1998) [ the paper is here ] provided what still is the clearest framework for establishing the huge magnitude of the energy technology challenge to meeting a growing energy commitment-a challenge measured in terawatts not gigawatts. That challenge has been largely ignored, with the policy focus placed on emissions and emissions reduction and the political will to reduce them, without due regard to the current limits on alternative low carbon energy technologies. The failure to address the Hoffert et al energy technology question is reflected in the fact that since 2000 (and including 2013) the share of global energy consumption accounted for by fossil fuels has remained essentially constant at 86.5-87.0%. (Here I use BP Energy Statistics.) globally, the &quot;progress&quot; made with non-hydro renewables is offset by a decline in energy from nuclear power plants. Not surprisingly, the carbon content of energy is the same in 2013 as it was in the early 1990s and actually rose a little since 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Davis and Socolow are clearly right that the climate has not benefited from the lack of progress on the energy technology front, billions of people, particularly in the emerging country/developing world, have benefited substantially from the energy generated. As far as I can see the standoff will continue until there is recognition that climate&nbsp;change is first and foremost an energy technology problem, one that cannot be solved/resolved without a great deal more than emission reduction pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council was concerned that I was using too wide a brush:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You say- &quot;Given the&nbsp;near-term and enduring benefits of electric power expansion&nbsp;in developing countries, the other long-term effect of expanded coal-powered generation is accrued wealth and economic growth...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This statement conflates three things: electrification services, electric generating capacity, and coal-fired generating capacity.&nbsp; The implication is that there is a serious tradeoff between constraining cumulative global CO2 emissions and meeting the needs of developing countries for increased electrification services.&nbsp; Truth is, the CO2 commitment from new generating capacity in the poorest countries will be small, even if they build mostly coal.&nbsp; But building mostly coal is not the only path they or other countries need to follow to expand electrification services.&nbsp; When the world's wealthiest countries begin to take climate protection seriously, there are ways in which any incremental costs of pursuing a low-carbon electrification path in poorer countries can be shared based on all countries' strategic interests in avoiding a disrupted climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Davis, one of the paper authors, added this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave is right to point out that the largest commitments we've quantified are only distantly related to meeting the energy needs of the underserved. The big commitments reflect coal-based industrialization and energy-intensive development whose value is more questionable given the climate and health impacts entailed and availability of cleaner and more energy-efficient options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I responded with this question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given urbanization trends, particularly, centralized power production and the jobs and output that come with industrialization are certainly a big factor for many governments, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, but that's the distant relation. We point out that the world built 89 GW [gigawatts, or billion watts] of coal-fired capacity per year 2010-2012. That's roughly equal to the entire generating capacity of sub-Saharan Africa being added every year. These plants are supporting large-scale industrialization that is a world apart from providing basic energy services, even if one dreams of the other. They're related just as the merits of different graduate schools are in the minds of parent teaching their toddlers to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Green responded to Davis and Hawkins:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Dave is talking about the underserved in the sense of the poorest many of whom are not even hooked up to the grid. But my comment addresses the huge energy demands as people move beyond the very poorest. Think here of the many countries, especially the populous ones, that are industrializing and urbanizing. They inevitably will require a lot of energy, if for no other reason than that materials for construction (steel, cement, flat glass, aluminum, copper) are hugely energy intensive - with energy intensities an order of magnitude higher than that for most other manufactured goods. Think too about the demand for appliances including air conditioning as people move into the middle class. These are key factors in the rise in energy demand and the observed increase in fossil fuel generating capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also take issue with Dave's suggestion of good alternatives to fossil fuel generated energy. With the possible exception of nuclear energy, which to date has faced numerous hurdles, there certainly aren't on anything like the scale required. And little has changed in this respect since Hoffert et al, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Trembath at the Breakthrough Institute joined the general discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for the note. As you know, Breakthrough and our colleagues at the Consortium for Science, Policy &amp; Outcomes (and development/energy experts from across the world) addressed this issue in our April report&nbsp;&quot;Our High-Energy Planet.&quot;&nbsp;As Professor Green mentioned, the singular focus on emissions is pervasive, and in some cases understandable (for instance, comparing national emissions accounts - measured in MTCO2 - is often much easier than harmonizing and comparing trade-adjusted energy consumption - measured variously in Mtoe, GWhs, bbls, EJs, etc etc). But in the case of energy in emerging economies, the laser focus on emissions is inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been some movement towards a &quot;gigawatt-hours commitment,&quot; as you write. This is the Decade of Sustainable Energy for All, after all. Unfortunately, the dominant frameworks used for understanding the energy access challenge - including those of the UN and IEA - are pretty clearly unacceptable. There are two main problems. The first is an almost exclusive focus on basic household electricity access, often in remote areas, without attendant attention to urbanizing populations, industrializing economies, etc. The second is the scale of ambition. As most on this thread will know, energy access is defined at 250-500kWh/year. This compares to the average German consumption of over 7000kWh/yr. With German levels of consumption, a planet of 9-10 billion in midcentury would require three times as much energy as the world does today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't start with this very basic, fundamental point, then we're not really having a discussion about energy development or climate&nbsp;change. Again, as Professor Green writes, these realities are commonly ignored, even though folks like Marty Hoffert, Nathan Lewis, Richard Smalley, and John Holdren pointed them out over a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morgan Bazilian and Roger Pielke, Jr.&nbsp;have described&nbsp;what it actually take for sub-Saharan Africa to reach levels of energy consumption enjoyed by South Africans or Americans. China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and other emerging countries have of course developed largely with coal-fired power. Africa appears poised to&nbsp;mostly leapfrog coal&nbsp;straight towards large hydro and natural gas. No one has yet conceived of a feasible energy development strategy - to power cities, industries, major infrastructure, etc - with renewables or nuclear as the dominant energy sources.&nbsp;Fortunately, a lot of the much-needed work on delivering truly scalable and affordable zero-carbon alternative is being done in the developing world itself. China is pursuing nuclear, solar, and carbon capture at a much greater scale than most Western economies. There are several dozen other countries investing in next-generation nuclear technologies (along with things like renewables, shale gas, coal-to-gas, etc.) to power rapidly growing demand. If decarbonization is to remain a&nbsp;priority&nbsp;- as it should&nbsp;- the energy innovation momentum of the developing world must be captured and accelerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would finally recommend the work of Catherine Wolfram at UC Berkeley, who has both criticized the energy projections methods of the IEA and most recently introduced the very helpful framework of&nbsp;&quot;under-grid&quot;&nbsp;populations, which are very near but unconnected to nascent electricity grids. While&nbsp;some in the West&nbsp;have apparently decided that delivering energy access is a household event best pursued by developed-world charities, NGOs, and entrepreneurs, what we actually see with electricity is similar to what we see with food - good governance and political institutions are essential for equitable and abundant distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute weighed in:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, everything has changed since 1998, making Marty's paper even less relevant today. A few quick highlights, doubtless incomplete:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Half the new generating capacity the world has added since 2008 has been renewable. (In 2013, 68% of China's new capacity was renewable, the majority of it solar and wind; in Europe, 72%.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In each of the past three years, the world invested &gt;$250b investment in non-hydro renewables, adding &gt;80 GW per year. Orders for central thermal plants continue to fade because they have no business case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- PV power is scaling faster than cellphones worldwide, and in concert with high end-use efficiency (e.g. LED lighting) has extraordinary potential to reach those with no electricity as well as in peri-urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- China in 2012 increased electricity output more from non-hydro renewables than from all fossil-fueled and nuclear sources, and in 2013, added more PV capacity than the US had added since it invented PVs in 1954. RMI's Reinventing Fire: China collaboration with ERI, EF/C, and LBNL is turning up cost-effective practical potential to raise China's 2050 carbon productivity (GDP per unit of fossil fuel) by &gt;=15x. The potential in India, where a revolution in efficiency and renewables is also emerging, may be even greater. Both these countries make more electricity from windpower than from nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Unsubsidized US market prices in favorable US sites are ~$0.07/kWh for PV power and ~$0.04/kWh for windpower, with both falling rather rapidly, but already they beat new combined-cycle gas, even neglecting gas's ~$2/GJ price-volatility cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Grid integration of high-renewables mixes, for those paying attention, is now an interesting evolutionary opportunity, not a prohibitive technological or economic challenge. (See http://www.rmi.org/storage_necessity_myth_amory_lovins for a short nontechnical summary of why no breakthrough in bulk electrical storage is needed.) Four EU countries not especially rich in hydropower got about half their 2013 electricity consumption from renewables-Spain 45%, Scotland 46%, Denmark &gt;=47%, Portugal 58%-with excellent reliability and no additions of bulk storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Micropower-the Economist's term for renewables, less big hydro, plus cogeneration-now produces one-fourth of the world's electricity (&gt;2x nuclear output); see RMI's July 2014 Micropower Database update for details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Commonly mentioned renewable issues around land-use turned out to be a canard (http://www.rmi.org/Knowledge-Center/Library/2011-07_RenewableEnergysFootprintMyth).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Both globally and nationally, renewables excluding big hydro have scaled at least as fast as nuclear power ever did, and without its two-decade &quot;windup&quot; period of building the very demanding capabilities and complex institutions required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Properly integrated renewables have emerged as a uniquely profitable and practical pathway to resilient grids that make big cascading blackouts impossible-without adding material cost (see Transform scenario in Reinventing Fire).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Although U.S. utilities typically pay ~$0.02-0.03/kWh for efficiency, RMI's empirically grounded Reinventing Fire synthesis showed in detail how to quadruple U.S. electric end-use efficiency at an average cost of ~$0.007/kWh (2009 $). The average IRR for 3-4x higher energy productivity in US buildings is 33%; for doubled energy productivity in US industry, 21%. Previous analyses show higher costs and smaller savings because they left so much out, including integrative design, which often turns diminishing into expanding returns to investments in energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The world is investing &gt;$300b/y in energy efficiency (the electric fraction is unknown but significant), and some major economies like the US and Germany show pretty steady declines in electricity use even as their economies grow. US weather-adjusted electric intensity, for example, fell 3.4% in 2012 alone. It's probably reasonable to estimate that efficiency's annual addition to global electrical services is at least comparable to that of nonhydro renewables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- It is not essential for developing countries to repeat industrialized countries' historic trajectories: on the contrary, they can leapfrog in energy supply as many did in cellphones. Some are already doing exactly that. Experience teaches that waiting for the wires to reach the villages, bringing unaffordable thermal power, is impractical. The smart solution is to skip the wires, just as in telecomms, and go efficient/renewable/resilient/distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- In general, developing countries have lower end-use efficiency and have more infrastructure yet unbuilt, and they can more easily build right than fix later, so they have far more dynamic and capacious efficiency opportunities than industrialized countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- As Ashok Gadgil and I showed ~23 years ago from World Bank data, investing in negawatts wherever they're cheaper than megawatts cuts by ~4 orders of magnitude (3 from intensity, 1 from velocity) the capital needed by the power sector - the most capital-intensive sector, gobbling about &frac14; of all development capital. Such least-cost investment could turn that sector into a net exporter of capital to fund other development needs. That's the most powerful macroeconomic lever we know for global development; yet few finance ministers have ever heard of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, convergent trends in renewable and distributed power, empowered customers, liberalized markets, transparent pricing, and radical end-use efficiency are building an energy future very different from the past. Powerful players are betting on this new horse, coming up fast on the outside. Those who can't see that horse will continue to lose value, because their preferences have more cost and financial risk than investors wish to fund. These market forces will ultimately prove more important than policy, international agreements, or the inertia of those with old ideas and trapped equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I haven't time to enter a protracted discussion about these facts and ideas, but was surprised by their absence from the thread, and hope their injection may prove helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Green responded to Lovins's arguments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to square the energy facts presented by Amory Lovins with those I have garnered from BP Energy Statistics. While the statistics here (see below) focus on primary energy consumption and those presented by Lovins focus on electricity (a component of final energy) the differences are stark. Here are just a few of the differences:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Lovins says renewables (including small hydro and co-generation) account for 47, 58, and 46% of electricity consumption in Denmark, Portugal and Spain, respectively. But non-hydro renewables (NHRs) and all hydro accounted for only 5.7%, 28% and 19%, respectively, of primary energy consumption in 2013 in these three countries. If only NHRs are considered the percentages would be much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Globally, NHRs accounted for 2.2% of primary energy consumption in 2013-up from 0.5% in 2000. If all hydro is added in the share in 2013 rises to 8.9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. All of the gain in share of NHRs share since 2000, was offset by the decline in share of nuclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Lovins claims regarding the contribution of NHRs to electricity consumption in China in 2013 must contend with the fact that the NHRs increased by only 9.4 million million tonnes of oil equivalent (mTOE) between 2012-2013 compared to 100 mTOE for fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As indicated in an earlier intervention, low carbon energy has not made any inroads into the 86.5-87% dominant share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption since 2000. What NHRs have gained has been at the expense of nuclear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would note that Alex Trembath's useful intervention to this discussion provides insight into why we can expect global energy consumption will continue to grow, and tangentially why so much of that energy will be supplied by fossil fuels without an major breakthroughs in energy technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trembath built on Green's comment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Professor Green, the numbers for even 2013 are not nearly as optimistic as Dr. Lovins suggests. Over 2012, 2013 consumption of different energy sources rose by the following amounts, measured in Mtoe (note these are primary energy, not only electricity):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil: 46.1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas: 34.1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal: 103.0</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear: 3.3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hydro: 22.2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind: 24.0</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar: 6.9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Source: BP 2014)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There really ought to be a collegial rule against discussing energy consumption trends without mentioning capacity factor, which explain why 68% of capacity added in 2013 was renewable but a much smaller minority of added generation was renewable. Capacity factor of course also explains why renewables excluding large hydro (and excluding CHP) account for almost twice the installed capacity of global nuclear, yet nuclear in 2013 still generated about 20% more electricity than all those sources combined. These graphs are taken from RMI's Micropower Database; the first is capacity and the second is generation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course we see here also how essential including cogeneration (typically combined heat and power using natural gas) is for drawing such optimistic conclusions about micro generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm also not sure along what metric Dr. Lovins finds that &quot; globally and nationally, renewables excluding big hydro have scaled at least as fast as nuclear power ever did.&quot; As this analysis by my colleagues shows, the best cases of nuclear have outpaced the best cases of nuclear when the metric is added generation divided by national population:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course some of the fastest energy, not carbon, transitions have been with natural gas. The UK went from 0% natural gas for electricity in 1990 to 40% in 2000. The US deployed over 250 GW of natural gas generation capacity in the last 20 years, and here's what our own energy transition has looked like:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain subsidized and unsubsidized renewables projects can come in at low cost, and we should celebrate these and learn from their successes. But while Dr. Lovins cites 7c/kWh as a best case for solar, the EIA still finds average LCOE of solar at 13c/kWh, higher than advanced nuclear and, of course, higher than natural gas. Wind does appear to have reached an all time low, settling in 4-6c/kWh unsubsidized, as the recent LBNL report showed. However, it must be remembered that these technologies' value to the grid decreases, and integration cost increases, with higher penetration. This is from the work of Lawrence Berkeley National Labs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dynamic is evident in Germany, where wholesale power prices are being depressed by must-dispatch, low-marginal cost renewables, but balancing this intermittency is causing retail power prices to rise, both from increasing FIT commitments, and increasingly with costs like capacity payments for baseload power stations and curtailment payments for excess renewables. Here's the results of a review of increasing integration costs from variable renewables:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the efficiency side of things,&nbsp;we&nbsp;and&nbsp;others&nbsp;have long requested that RMI better incorporate rebound effects into modeling future energy consumption patterns. For instance. In Reinventing Fire (RF), Lovins et al cite 2 studies finding transportation sector rebounds at 3 and 22 percent, but ultimately exclude transportation rebounds from their analysis (Sorrell 2007's survey and the European Commission's review find transpo rebound between 10 and 30 percent; Gavankar and Geyer 2010 identify long-term rebounds between 20 and 65 percent). RF uses 10 and 5 percent rebound for heating and cooling respectively, while Sorrell 2007 finds 10-30 percent for heating and 1-26 percent for cooling. RF rejects the idea of rebounds effects in industrial processes, while Saunders finds rebound in energy intensive industries like primary metals, utilities, manufacturing, and agriculture to be in the range of 20-35 percent. The IPCC and the IEA have recently begun to incorporate rebound effects into their analyses, largely at the behest of organizations like Breakthrough, UKERC, the European Commission, and vocal scholars like Harry Saunders, Steve Sorrell, Joyashree Roy, Dorothy Maxwell, and Karen Turner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's clear from the above that the world still continues to rely primarily on fossil fuels for development and that even the richest economies are far from achieving significant scaling of renewables (or nuclear) for major decarbonization. Where renewables have scaled, they have brought national electricity prices right up with them. This is especially true for solar PV, where in Germany and Spain FIT payments have caused serious energy policy turmoil, and in the US, where net metering policies have caused public utility backlash against PV deployment in states like Arizona and California (a result of utilities being forced to pay 15-30ckWh for PV electricity instead of purchasing on the wholesale markets for 4-6c/kWh).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To return to the point of Andy's original prompt. Renewables are expanding and their costs are declining, but isolated and contextless success stories don't help us understand the true scale of both the climate and energy development challenges. Drs. Davis and Socolow's intervention with the new paper is extremely helpful because it aims to reveal the scale of the challenge. While renewables continue to develop worldwide - and while countries as varied as US, UK, China, South Korea, Turkey, UAE, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Jordan, etc continue to develop nuclear - fossil still reigns. Now the deployment of fossil and coal generation in regions like sub-Saharan Africa is very likely a net positive for humanity, since a lack of modern electricity systems is largely what makes those locales most vulnerable to climate and other impacts in the first place. But again, if decarbonization of the global economy is the ultimate goal, then I think it's clear we still need answers to the cost and scalability of nuclear and renewables both large and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point Rob Socolow, one of the paper authors, sought to be sure readers caught the main intent of the paper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be nice to flag what Steve Davis and I have contributed which we think is new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are calling attention to a systematic neglect of capital investment decisions in the reporting rules related to climate&nbsp;change, relative to current emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We introduce a concept, &quot;committed emissions,&quot; and a methodology to quantify the carbon implications of capital investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We show quantitatively that, for the global power sector in any recent year, two quantities are comparable: 1) current emissions that year from all power plants, and 2) &quot;committed emissions&quot; from plants that went on line that year - emissions that can be expected from these plants in the future (when we assume a 40 year lifetime).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We take the concept of remaining committed emissions developed in Steve's 2010 paper with Caldeira and Matthews and work out the trajectory of that value for the global power sector each year over the past 60 years (the earlier paper reported the value for only a single recent year). We find that this index has never fallen, is over 300 GtO2 today and was 200 GtCO2 as recently as Year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We recommend that &quot;committed emissions&quot; be incorporated prominently into energy analysis, scenario making, and climate policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burt Richter, the physics Nobelist and author of &quot;Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Climate&nbsp;Change and Energy in the 21st Century,&quot; added this comment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry to jump in late, but I have been away. I think of world energy demand as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy = (population) x (per capita income) x (energy/GDP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know population is going up (UN mid-level projection is about 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.5 by 2100), and the poor want to get rich while the rich don't want to get poor, so the only way to work on global energy demand is the last term which is really energy efficiency. If you want to worry about emissions, add another term (emission per unit energy) which is where clean energy comes in. I use &quot;clean&quot; rather than &quot;renewables&quot; because renewables is a term designed to exclude nuclear, big hydro, and large scale efficiency efforts. Taken with most projections for growth energy demand will be up by nearly a factor of 4 by 2100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of energy is the question? The most recent authoritative numbers for the world that I can find are from the IEA and credit big hydro and combustibles with significant contributions to the total, while wind and solar are quite small. As for Amory's numbers, Denmark is insignificant of the world scale and is connected to the Scandinavian power grid so has lots of back up. Germany is not so connected and so already is having trouble with the stability of its grid. In discussions with Amory in the past I have always found it useful to ask for references for his numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the world's poorest countries, they contribute negligibly to emissions and to demand. Let them start up development in any way they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came input from Nathan Myhrvold, who is best known for his time in research at Microsoft and as an inventor and investor, but has been an author on some relevant energy papers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burt's outlook is one that I share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think of energy usage from a &quot;rich world&quot; perspective where there is low growth in demand you can imagine the 21st century challenge to be one where we replace existing fossil fuel energy with clean (in Burt's sense) energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the reality is that the currently poor world is getting richer so by 2100 we need way more primary energy.  Today's entire infrastructure will be only ~25% of the picture.  The ~4X increase will be in the developing world which will put a huge premium on cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Burt asks, what will that be?   At present it is very hard to be optimistic that the new energy will be clean.  That isn't the current course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amory appears to be far more optimistic than I am, based on numbers that I can't reconcile with the figures available to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, who happens to edit the journal in which the Davis-Socolow paper is published, offered some overarching thoughts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Editor-in-Chief of Environmental Research Letters I am delighted to see this neat paper by Davis and Socolow generating this useful discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commitment accounting as per Davis and Socolow is useful (I dispute that these facts are not widely known) but it is always useful to be reminded of the implications of our collective decisions today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key point that Davis and Socolow make is that when we talk about stranded assets their measure puts this huge looming threat into a form that can easily become something the business community can assess in terms of risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was at the World Bank my number one goal was to make as many multinational agencies perform life-cycle accounting of emissions on all of their current assets and future potential investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a step that governments, companies, municipalities and others could commit to at, for example, the&nbsp;September 23Climate Summit in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for entities not ready to implement a price on carbon, simply making this accounting a business requirement would dramatically advance the calculation along the lines that Davis and Socolow recommend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, the University of California system has committed to eliminating fossil fuel use by 2025 - a major task given our transportation footprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to do this is to start with good, holistic accounting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We took a step there with a recent national carbon emissions per household map where we show interactively the average footprint for each US zip code. (Yes, a finer-grained map is needed; that paper is next.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, a very simple directive that states, agencies, cities, and the federal government could do to bring the committed emissions into focus is to do that GHG life-cycle analysis along with other project assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, for example, we would recommend using the current market price of carbon GHG emissions (around $11/ton in CA), but this could arguably vary to the http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/EPAactivities/economics/scc.html&quot;&gt;social cost of carbon or other reasonable values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there, agencies, financial officers, CFOs would all know the long-term implications of their decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kammen appended this thought focused on his years of work in developing countries:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd like to add a bit on the developing nation aspects of this conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been working in Central America and East Africa for the last 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am also just back from far northern Kenya where I was working with the grid planning and the infrastructure for both on-grid wind energy (Africa's largest wind farm is begin built to take advantage of remarkable wind site and the transmission access provided by a new Kenya-Ethiopia linking line).  Photo over Lake Turkana with the wind site at upper right (construction begins this fall).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's grid today is 1.8 GW, and the country's least-cost form of new energy is geothermal (8.5 cents/kWh) for which the economic resource is &gt; 9 GW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, off-grid solar is fastest growing and largest component of new energy access in a country with 29% grid access today.  One company with which my lab has an NDA/MOU is the largest user of mobile online money in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is also on path to replace its hydropower dominated grid of today with one where wind and geothermal are the largest providers of energy (hydropower in the region is increasingly uncertain due to climate&nbsp;change).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is not unique. Many nations have this clean energy capacity. This message gets lost all the time. 80%+ clean energy paths are not at all hard to find (we are doing assessment for 10 nations right now), and other researchers are doing similar things elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On and off-grid are both vital, and public-private partnerships and pure private sector investments are key.  We need to find ways to support locally directed efforts that meet these fully decarbonized local visions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Davis circled back the prime points of the paper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of how well renewables are or are not doing, the point Rob and I are trying to make is that fossil infrastructure is still expanding in a big way: the total committed emissions represented by power plants is growing even faster than annual emissions.  Whether or not we share Amory's rosy outlook on renewables, these fossil commitments are inconsistent with a decline in emissions any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myhrvold reacted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a key point - the fossil infrastructure is still expanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Caldiera and I have done a lot of work recently in modeling atmospheric GHG concentration during switchover from fossil fuels to clean energy. A general lesson that comes from this work is that inertia in the climate system means that the &quot;hangover&quot; from emission lasts for decades. Radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and global average temperature continue to rise for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So even if you stopped emissions today, we would have climate impact for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are not stopping today - the fossil infrastructure is still expanding. The metric of &quot;committed emissions&quot; makes that clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed if one combined that metric with modeling results you could call it &quot;committed delta T&quot; - in effect power plant construction commits us to higher global average temperature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As promised, here's the transcript of Davis's video presentation on the work:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video Abstract for Commitment Accounting of CO2 Emissions, Davis and Socolow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things that makes climate&nbsp;change an especially difficult problem is that, for the average policymaker, and certainly the average person, it lacks immediacy. As one psychologist puts it, &quot;Climate&nbsp;change may ruin your future, but it won't mess up your evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that climate impacts are a threat in the long-run and will materialize slowly over time make it hard for us to get very excited about responding to the threat, no matter how devastating the impacts may turn out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, our instinct to wait and see is at odds with another characteristic of climate&nbsp;change, which is that it's a problem with huge inertia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a bit of physical inertia-it would take temperatures a few years to catch up with all the CO2 we've been dumping into the atmosphere even if we stopped today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more importantly, there is a tremendous amount of social, economic and political inertia. We've spent nearly two centuries and tens of trillions of dollars worldwide building up the largest network of infrastructure that has ever existed to extract, process, and deliver fossil fuels and fossil energy to consumers. All of this long-lived infrastructure represents an enormous investment that won't be easy to walk away from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea behind the new paper my co-author Rob Socolow and I have written is that it's possible to estimate future GHG emissions that are locked-in by all the existing fossil infrastructure, what we call &quot;committed emissions.&quot; Our paper demonstrates the concept of this commitment accounting by quantifying the CO2 emissions that are expected to come from now-existing power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than tallying up CO2 emissions from power plants in the year they come out of the plant's smokestacks, we assume a typical plant lifetime of 40 years and allocate the lifetime emissions of each power plant to the year it was built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we found is that the currently existing power plants around the world-unless they are retired early or retrofitted so that their emissions are captured-can be anticipated to emit roughly 300 billion tons of CO2 in the future. That's about 10 years worth of current emissions from existing power plants alone, and enough to put a big dent in the remaining budget of emissions we can dump into the atmosphere and still have a reasonable chance of avoiding 2 degrees C of warming relative to the preindustrial era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more daunting than this large amount of committed emissions, we found that total committed emissions grew by an average of 4% between 2000 and 2012 as we built more coal-fired power plants over that period than in any previous 12-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power plants in the US, EU and India each represent about 10% of the current committed emissions, and the incredible expansion of coal-power in China shows up, as all these Chinese plants represent 42% of global committed emissions. Power plants in Japan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Iran also have substantial and growing share of the world total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now to be clear, &quot;committed&quot; doesn't mean &quot;unavoidable.&quot; There's nothing to stop us from shuttering a brand new power plant or retrofitting it with carbon capture and storage technology, but of course there'd be costs associated with doing of either of those things. Once something is built and operating, there really is some commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO, coming back to the issues of immediacy and inertia, our hope is that the sort of commitment accounting described and demonstrated in the paper will be taken up by other analysts and used to evaluate the long-run climate impacts of current capital investments, in turn allowing policymakers to confront these distant implications of their decisions in the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for listening, and feel free to email me with questions about the paper or the concept of commitment accounting of GHG emissions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Runaway growth in the emission of greenhouse gases is swamping all political efforts to deal with the problem, raising the risk of ''severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts'' over the coming decades, according to a draft of a major new United Nations report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming is already cutting grain production by several percentage points, the report found, and that could grow much worse if emissions continue unchecked. Higher seas, devastating heat waves, torrential rain and other climate extremes are also being felt around the world as a result of human-produced emissions, the draft report said, and those problems are likely to intensify unless the gases are brought under control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world may already be nearing a temperature at which the loss of the vast ice sheet covering Greenland would become inevitable, the report said. The actual melting would then take centuries, but it would be unstoppable and could result in a sea level rise of 23 feet, with additional increases from other sources like melting Antarctic ice, potentially flooding the world's major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reduction in snow and ice, and in global mean-sea-level rise; and it is extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,'' the draft report said. ''The risk of abrupt and irreversible change increases as the magnitude of the warming increases.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was drafted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, a body of scientists and other experts appointed by the United Nations that periodically reviews and summarizes climate research. It is not final and could change substantially before release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, intended to summarize and restate a string of earlier reports about climate&nbsp;change released over the past year, is to be unveiled in early November, after an intensive editing session in Copenhagen. A late draft was sent to the world's governments for review this week, and a copy of that version was obtained by The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using blunter, more forceful language than the reports that underpin it, the new draft highlights the urgency of the risks that are likely to be intensified by continued emissions of heat-trapping gases, primarily carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that companies and governments had identified reserves of these fuels at least four times larger than could safely be burned if global warming is to be kept to a tolerable level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means if society wants to limit the risks to future generations, it must find the discipline to leave a vast majority of these valuable fuels in the ground, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cited rising political efforts around the world on climate&nbsp;change, including efforts to limit emissions as well as to adapt to changes that have become inevitable. But the report found that these efforts were being overwhelmed by construction of facilities like new coal-burning power plants that will lock in high emissions for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1970 to 2000, global emissions of greenhouse gases grew at 1.3 percent a year. But from 2000 to 2010, that rate jumped to 2.2 percent a year, the report found, and the pace seems to be accelerating further in this decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major part of the jump was caused by industrialization in China, which now accounts for half the world's coal use. Those emissions are being incurred in large part to produce goods for consumption in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissions are now falling in nearly all Western countries because of an increased focus on efficiency and the spread of lower-emitting sources of electricity. But the declines are not yet sufficient to offset rising emissions in developing countries, many of whose governments are focused on pulling their people out of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new report found that it was still technically possible to limit global warming to an internationally agreed upper bound of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above the preindustrial level. But continued political delays for another decade or two will make that unachievable without severe economic disruption, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report comes a month before a summit meeting of world leaders in New York that is meant to set the stage for a potential global agreement on emissions that would be completed next year. However, concern is growing among climate experts that the leaders may not offer ambitious commitments in their speeches on Sept. 23, a potential continuation of the political inaction that has marked the climate issue for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report did find that efforts to counter climate&nbsp;change are gathering force at the regional and local level in many countries. This is especially clear in the United States, where Congress is paralyzed and the national government has effectively ceded leadership on climate to states like California, Massachusetts and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, using his executive authority under the Clean Air Act, is seeking to impose national limits on emissions of greenhouse gases, but he faces profound legal and political challenges as he seeks to put his policy into effect before leaving office in early 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report found that past emissions, and the failure to heed scientific warnings about the risks, have made large-scale climatic shifts inevitable. But lowering emissions would still slow the expected pace of change, the report said, providing critical decades for human society and the natural world to adapt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,'' the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The earth has so far warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit above the level that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution, the report found, and that seemingly modest increase is causing the effects already being seen around the world. A continued rapid growth of emissions in coming decades could conceivably lead to a global warming exceeding 8 degrees Fahrenheit, the report found. The warming would be higher over land areas, and higher still at the poles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warming that substantial would almost certainly have catastrophic effects, including a mass extinction of plants and animals, huge shortfalls in food production, extreme coastal flooding and many other problems, the report found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report noted that severe weather events, some of them linked to human-produced emissions, had disrupted the food supply in recent years, leading to several spikes in the prices of staple grains and destabilizing some governments in poorer countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued warming, the report found, is likely to ''slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hot spots of hunger.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is working to forge a sweeping international climate&nbsp;change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions, but without ratification from Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for this agreement, to be signed at a United Nations summit meeting in 2015 in Paris, the negotiators are meeting with diplomats from other countries to broker a deal to commit some of the world's largest economies to enact laws to reduce their carbon pollution. But under the Constitution, a president may enter into a legally binding treaty only if it is approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To sidestep that requirement, President Obama's climate negotiators are devising what they call a ''politically binding'' deal that would ''name and shame'' countries into cutting their emissions. The deal is likely to face strong objections from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from poor countries around the world, but negotiators say it may be the only realistic path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you want a deal that includes all the major emitters, including the U.S., you cannot realistically pursue a legally binding treaty at this time,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a top climate&nbsp;change official in the Clinton administration who works closely with the Obama White House on international climate&nbsp;change policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers in both parties on Capitol Hill say there is no chance that the currently gridlocked Senate will ratify a climate&nbsp;change treaty in the near future, especially in a political environment where many Republican lawmakers remain skeptical of the established science of human-caused global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's a strong understanding of the difficulties of the U.S. situation, and a willingness to work with the U.S. to get out of this impasse,'' said Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate&nbsp;change to the United Nations. ''There is an implicit understanding that this not require ratification by the Senate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American negotiators are instead homing in on a hybrid agreement -- a proposal to blend legally binding conditions from an existing 1992 treaty with new voluntary pledges. The mix would create a deal that would update the treaty, and thus, negotiators say, not require a new vote of ratification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries would be legally required to enact domestic climate&nbsp;change policies -- but would voluntarily pledge to specific levels of emissions cuts and to channel money to poor countries to help them adapt to climate&nbsp;change. Countries might then be legally obligated to report their progress toward meeting those pledges at meetings held to identify those nations that did not meet their cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's some legal and political magic to this,'' said Jake Schmidt, an expert in global climate negotiations with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. ''They're trying to move this as far as possible without having to reach the 67-vote threshold'' in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy comes as scientists warn that the earth is already experiencing the first signs of human-caused global warming -- more severe drought and stronger wildfires, rising sea levels and more devastating storms -- and the United Nations heads toward what many say is the body's last chance to avert more catastrophic results in the coming century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month, delegates will gather at a sideline meeting on climate&nbsp;change to try to make progress toward the deal next year in Paris. A December meeting is planned in Lima, Peru, to draft the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seeking to go around Congress to push his international climate&nbsp;change agenda, Mr. Obama is echoing his domestic climate strategy. In June, he bypassed Congress and used his executive authority to order a far-reaching regulation forcing American coal-fired power plants to curb their carbon emissions. That regulation, which would not be not final until next year, already faces legal challenges, including a lawsuit filed on behalf of a dozen states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unilateral action by the world's largest economy will not be enough to curb the rise of carbon pollution across the globe. That will be possible only if the world's largest economies, including India and China, agree to enact similar cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's international climate strategy is likely to infuriate Republican lawmakers who already say the president is abusing his executive authority by pushing through major policies without congressional approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Unfortunately, this would be just another of many examples of the Obama administration's tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard laws it doesn't like -- and to ignore the elected representatives of the people when they don't agree,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deal that would not need to be ratified by the United States or any other nation is also drawing fire from the world's poorest countries. In African and low-lying island nations -- places that scientists say are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate&nbsp;change -- officials fear that any agreement made outside the structure of a traditional United Nations treaty will not bind rich countries to spend billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with the forces of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor countries look to rich countries to help build dams and levees to guard against coastal flooding from rising seas levels, or to provide food aid during pervasive droughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Without an international agreement that binds us, it's impossible for us to address the threats of climate&nbsp;change,'' said Richard Muyungi, a climate negotiator for Tanzania. ''We are not as capable as the U.S. of facing this problem, and historically we don't have as much responsibility. What we need is just one thing: Let the U.S. ratify the agreement. If they ratify the agreement, it will trigger action across the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers of United Nations climate negotiations, which have gone on for more than two decades without achieving a global deal to legally bind the world's biggest polluters to carbon cuts, say that if written carefully such an agreement could be a creative and pragmatic way to at least level off the world's rapidly rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen countries are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the world's carbon pollution, chiefly from cars and coal-fired power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a 2009 climate meeting in Copenhagen, world leaders tried but failed to forge a new legally binding treaty to supplant the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Instead, they agreed only to a series of voluntary pledges to cut carbon emissions through 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's climate&nbsp;change negotiators are desperate to avoid repeating the failure of Kyoto, the United Nations' first effort at a legally binding global climate&nbsp;change treaty. Nations around the world signed on to the deal, which would have required the world's richest economies to cut their carbon emissions, but the Senate refused to ratify the treaty, ensuring that the world's largest historic carbon polluter was not bound by the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen years later, the Senate obstacle remains. Even though Democrats currently control the chamber, the Senate has been unable to reach agreement to ratify relatively noncontroversial United Nations treaties. In 2012, for example, Republican senators blocked ratification of a United Nations treaty on equal rights for the disabled, even though the treaty was modeled after an American law and had been negotiated by a Republican president, George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fall, Senate Republicans are poised to pick up more seats, and possibly to retake control of the chamber. Mr. McConnell, who has been one of the fiercest opponents of Mr. Obama's climate&nbsp;change policy, comes from a coal-heavy state that could be an economic loser in any climate-change protocol that targets coal-fired power plants, the world's largest source of carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earth's climate is shaped by the interplay of two complicated and turbulent systems - the atmosphere and oceans. (The photo above is from the two years I spent at that interface as crew on ocean-roaming sailboats.) The oceans hold the majority of heat in the system, are full of sloshy cycles on time scales from years to decades and, despite an increase in monitoring using sophisticated diving buoys, remain only spottily tracked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no wonder, then, that assessing the mix of forces shaping short-term wiggles in global and regional atmospheric temperature (years to decades) remains a daunting exercise. That's why it's worth stepping back after weeks of news about studies of the role of oceans in retarding, and sometimes accelerating, global warming to reflect a bit on the difference between edge-pushing analysis and firm scientific conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's firmly established is that the climate is warming, that the buildup of human-generated heat-trapping greenhouse gases is contributing substantially to the warming and that while the buildup of gases is steady, the rise in temperatures is not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been a burst of worthy research aimed at figuring out what causes the stutter-steps in the process - including the current hiatus/pause/plateau that has generated so much discussion. The oceans are high on the long list of contributors, given their capacity to absorb heat. The recent studies have pointed variously to process in the Pacific and Atlantic and Southern oceans (the latter being the extraordinary band of seas in the Southern Hemisphere where winds circulate around the globe unimpeded by continents).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's important work to be done on this question but - as the oceanographer Carl Wunsch notes at the end of this post - the paucity of data on ocean heat makes it tough to get beyond &quot;maybe&quot; answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Spotts of the Christian Science Monitor wrote a nice piece on the battle of the ocean basins. Here's his description of the Atlantic mechanism:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[I]n the Atlantic, the heat is carried north as part of a powerful current system known as the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. The north-flowing Gulf Stream is the most visible manifestation of this circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time it reaches the far North Atlantic, the dense, salty water has cooled and sinks. It plunges toward the seafloor and heads south at depth, retaining some of the heat it accumulated on the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news article in the journal Science, which published the latest paper on the Atlantic's role in decades-long global temperature fluctuations, Eli Kintisch described the Pacific argument this way:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[I]n the 17 August Nature Climate&nbsp;Change study, a team led by [Kevin] Trenberth suggests that natural variability in the Pacific explains more than half of the hiatus. Based on data and climate simulations, they argue that a pattern known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which shifts every 20 to 30 years, is driving the increased upwelling as well as other climate trends, including the rapid warming of the Arctic and recent cold winters in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newest paper, in the current issue of Science, &quot;Varying planetary heat sink led to global-warming slowdown and acceleration,&quot; argues that the Atlantic not only has shaped the current plateau, but also was responsible for half of the sharp global warming at the end of the 20th century. The paper, by Xianyao Chen of the Ocean University of China and Ka-Kit Tung of the University of Washington, has a remarkably trenchant abstract:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vacillating global heat sink at intermediate ocean depths is associated with different climate regimes of surface warming under anthropogenic forcing: The latter part of the 20th century saw rapid global warming as more heat stayed near the surface. In the 21st century, surface warming slowed as more heat moved into deeper oceans. In situ and reanalyzed data are used to trace the pathways of ocean heat uptake. In addition to the shallow La Ni&ntilde;a-like patterns in the Pacific that were the previous focus, we found that the slowdown is mainly caused by heat transported to deeper layers in the Atlantic and the Southern oceans, initiated by a recurrent salinity anomaly in the subpolar North Atlantic. Cooling periods associated with the latter deeper heat-sequestration mechanism historically lasted 20 to 35 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an e-mail exchange, Ka-Kit Tung noted something missed in a lot of press coverage - how this work can help reveal the steady warming in the background that is attributable to human activities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The underlying anthropogenic warming trend is 0.08 C per decade.... [That's 0.08 degrees Celsius, or 0.144 degrees Fahrenheit.] However, the flip side of this is that the anthropogenically forced trend is also 0.08 C per decade during the last two decades of the twentieth century when we backed out the positive contribution from the cycle....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked a range of climate and ocean scientists to weigh in on the paper. Many focused on details of the Atlantic-Pacific debate. A few took a broader view that's worth sharing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua K. Willis of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In regards to your question, if you mean how robust is the &quot;slowdown&quot; in global surface warming, the answer is it just probably just barely statistically significant. If you are wondering whether is it meaningful in terms of the public discourse about climate&nbsp;change, I would say the answer is no. The basic story of human caused global warming and its coming impacts is still the same: humans are causing it and the future will bring higher sea levels and warmer temperatures, the only questions are: how much and how fast?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the cause of the slowdown, I think there is still some debate, not just about the cause but about the details of what's going on. For example, there have been several studies including this one to suggest that some deeper layer of the oceans are warming faster now than they were 10 or 15 years ago. This suggestion of an accelerated warming in a deep layer of the ocean has been suggested mostly on the basis of results from reanalyses of different types (that is, numerical simulations of the ocean and atmosphere that are forced to fit observations in some manner). But it is not clear to me, actually, that an accelerated warming of some sub-surface layer of the ocean (at least in the globally-averaged sense) is robustly supported by the data itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we clear up whether there has been some kind of accelerated warming at depth in the real ocean, I think these results serve as interesting hypotheses about why the rate of surface warming has slowed-down, but we still lack a definitive answer on this topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Andrew Dessler of Texas A&amp;M University:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a few interesting things to note here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the hiatus is example of how science works. When it was first observed a few years ago, there were lots of theories - including things like stratospheric water vapor, solar cycles, stratospheric aerosol forcing. After some intense work by of the community, there is general agreement that the main driver is ocean variability. That's actually quite impressive progress and shows how legitimate uncertainty is handled by the scientific community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, I think it's important to put the hiatus in context. This is not an existential threat to the mainstream theory of climate. We are not going to find out that, lo and behold, carbon dioxide is not a greenhouse gas and is not causing warming. Rather, I expect that the hiatus will help us understand how ocean variability interacts with the long-term warming that humans are causing. In a few years, as we get to understand this more, skeptics will move on (just like they dropped arguments about the hockey stick and about the surface station record) to their next reason not to believe climate science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as this particular paper goes, I think the findings that the heat is going into the Atlantic and Southern Ocean's is probably pretty robust. However, I will defer to people like Josh Willis who know the data better than I do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's most exciting to me is that this is really a fascinating conundrum. People like Kevin Trenberth and Kosaka and Xie have published quite convincingly that the action seems to be in the Pacific. So the challenge is to try to resolve that evidence with the ocean heat data that shows that the energy is going into other ocean basins. Ultimately, the challenge come up with the parsimonious theory that fits all of the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do think that ocean variability may have played a role in the lack of warming in the middle of the 20th century, as well as the rapid warming of the 1980s and 1990s. But the argument that the hiatus will last for another decade or two is very weak and I would not put much faith in that. If the cycle has a period of 60-70 years, that means we have one or two cycles of observations. And I don't think you can much about a cycle with just 1-2 cycles: e.g., what the actual period of the variability is, how regular it is, etc. You really need dozen of cycles to determine what the actual underlying variability looks like. In fact, I don't think we even know if it IS a cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this brings up what to me is the real question: how much of the hiatus is pure internal variability and how much is a forced response (from loading the atmosphere with carbon). This paper seems to implicitly take the position that it's purely internal variability, which I'm not sure is true and might lead to a very different interpretation of the data and estimate of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, their estimate of 1-2 more decades before rapid warming resumes might be right; but, if so, I'd consider them lucky rather than smart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Michael Wallace, a professor emeritus of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, offered these thoughts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2001 I served as a member of the committee that drafted the National Research Council report, &quot;Climate&nbsp;Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions.&quot; The prevailing view at that time, to which I subscribed, was that the signal of human-induced global warming first clearly emerged from the background noise of natural variability starting in the 1970s and that the observed rate of increase from 1975 onward could be expected to continue into the 21st century. The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, released in 2007, offered a similar perspective, both in the text and in the figures in its Summary for Policymakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By that time, I was beginning to have misgivings about this interpretation. It seemed to me that the hiatus in the warming, which by then was approaching ten years in length, should not be dismissed as a statistical fluke. It was as legitimate a part of the record as the rapid rises in global-mean temperature in the 1980s and 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009 Zhaohua Wu contacted me about a paper that he, Norden Huang, and other colleagues were in the process of writing in which they attributed the stair-step behavior in the rate of global warming, including the current hiatus, to Atlantic multidecadal variability. I was initially a bit skeptical, but in time I began to appreciate the merits of their arguments and I became personally involved in the project. The paper (Wu et al.) encountered some tough sledding in the review process, but we persisted and the article finally appeared in Climate Dynamics three years ago. [ See Judith Curry's helpful discussion .]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new paper by Tung and Chen goes much farther than we did in making the case that Atlantic multidecadalvariability needs to be considered in the attribution of climate&nbsp;change. I'm glad to see that it is attracting attention in the scientific community, along with recent papers of Kosaka et al. and Meehl et al. emphasizing the role of ENSO-like variability. I hope this will lead to a broader discussion about the contribution of natural variability to local climate trends and to the statistics of extreme events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Wunsch, a visiting professor at Harvard and professor emeritus of oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a valuable cautionary comment on the range of papers finding oceanic drivers of short-term climate variations. He began by noting the challenge just in determining average conditions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem is that anyone can take a few measurements, average them, and declare it to be the global or regional value. It's completely legitimate, but only if you calculate the expected uncertainty and do it in a sensible manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system is noisy. Even if there were no anthropogenic forcing, one expects to see fluctuations including upward and downward trends, plateaus, spikes, etc. It's the nature of turbulent, nonlinear systems. I'm attaching a record of the height of the Nile - 700-1300 CE. Visually it's just what one expects. But imagine some priest in the interval from 900-1000, telling the king that the the Nile was obviously going to vanish...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or pick your own interval. Or look at the central England temperature record or any other long geophysical one. If the science is done&nbsp;right, the calculated uncertainty takes account of this background variation. But none of these papers, Tung, or Trenberth, does that. Overlain on top of this natural behavior is the small, and often shaky, observing systems, both atmosphere and ocean where the shifting places and times and technologies must also produce a change even if none actually occurred. The &quot;hiatus&quot; is likely real, but so what? The fuss is mainly about normal behavior of the climate system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central problem of climate science is to ask what you do and say when your data are, by almost any standard, inadequate? If I spend three years analyzing my data, and the only defensible inference is that &quot;the data are inadequate to answer the question,&quot; how do you publish? How do you get your grant renewed? A common answer is to distort the calculation of the uncertainty, or ignore it all together, and proclaim an exciting story that the New York Times will pick up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of this is somewhat like what goes on in the medical business: Small, poorly controlled studies are used to proclaim the efficacy of some new drug or treatment. How many such stories have been withdrawn years later when enough adequate data became available?                       </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is altering the natural world, from earlier springtimes to changes in bird migrations. But one of the strangest effects found so far is an owl that is evolving from a grey to brown colour.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tawny owl is a stocky owl often found in woodlands across Europe, calling out &quot;kew-wick&quot; and &quot;hoo, ho, ho&quot;, or as Shakespeare described in Love's Labour Lost: &quot;Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owl comes in two different feather colours, reddish-brown or pale grey. The brown birds tend to be more common in the warmer parts of Europe and the grey ones more often found in colder climates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Finland, the grey birds tend to dominate, but over the past 50 years records show a steady increase in the numbers of brown birds, and this matches milder winters with less snow, according to a study in the journal Nature Communications. It's thought that the grey-coloured owls are better camouflaged in snow, whilst the brown birds stand out against snow and make easy prey for predators - but they blend into the background when there is no snow around. And as winters have grown milder, so more brown owls have survived and passed on their brown-colour gene, resulting in more brown offspring - a case of evolution in response to rapid climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As snow is expected to become less common throughout Europe this century with rising temperatures, so the numbers of brown owls are expected to increase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists have discovered methane gas bubbling from the seafloor in an unexpected place: off the East Coast of the United States where the continental shelf meets the deeper Atlantic Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The methane is emanating from at least 570 locations, called seeps, from near Cape Hatteras, N.C., to the Georges Bank southeast of Nantucket, Mass. While the seepage is widespread, the researchers estimated that the amount of gas was tiny compared with the amount released from all sources each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper published online Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience, the scientists, including Adam Skarke of Mississippi State University and Carolyn Ruppel of the United States Geological Survey, reported evidence that the seepage had been going on for at least 1,000 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the depths of the seeps suggested that in most cases the gas did not reach the atmosphere but rather dissolved in the ocean, where it could affect the acidity of the water, at least locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But methane is a potent, if relatively short-lived, greenhouse gas, so the discovery should aid the study of an issue of concern to climate scientists: the potential for the release of huge stores of methane on land and under the seas as warming of the atmosphere and oceans continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It highlights a really key area where we can test some of the more radical hypotheses about climate&nbsp;change,'' said John Kessler, a professor at the University of Rochester who was not involved in the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methane seeps occur in many places, but usually in areas that are tectonically active, like off the West Coast of the United States, or that connect to deep petroleum basins, as in the Gulf of Mexico. The Atlantic margin, as the region where the shelf meets the deeper oceanic crust is known, is tectonically quiet, and most of the seeps are not thought to be linked to oil and gas deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a large amount of methane seepage in an area we didn't expect,'' Dr. Skarke said. ''That raises new questions for us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Ruppel said that at about 40 of the seeps -- those in water depths exceeding 3,300 feet -- the methane may be migrating up through the sediments from deeper reservoirs of the gas. Further studies would be needed to confirm this, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the gas is found to be originating from reservoirs, then oil companies could potentially be interested in determining whether the reservoirs can be tapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr. Ruppel said most of the seeps had been found in depths of about 800 to 2,000 feet, where the methane, which is produced by microbes, is most likely trapped in sediments near the seafloor, within cagelike molecules of ice called hydrates. Natural variability in water temperatures, caused by ocean circulation and other factors, may be warming these hydrates just enough to release the gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hydrates at such relatively shallow depths ''are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in temperature,'' she said. ''You don't have to change things very much to get the methane to come out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kessler, the author of an article reviewing the findings in the same journal, said that because the Atlantic margin was unaffected by tectonic activity or other factors, it should prove to be a convenient location to conduct long-term studies of links between climate&nbsp;change and methane releases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How will those release rates accelerate as bottom temperature warms, or how will they decelerate if there are some cooling events?'' Dr. Kessler said. ''We don't really have all of the answers. But this is a great place to try to find them.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planet's two largest ice sheets - in Greenland and Antarctica - are now being depleted at an astonishing rate of 120 cubic miles each year. That is the discovery made by scientists using data from CryoSat-2, the European probe that has been measuring the thickness of Earth's ice sheets and glaciers since it was launched by the European Space Agency in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more alarming, the rate of loss of ice from the two regions has more than doubled since 2009, revealing the dramatic impact that climate&nbsp;change is beginning to have on our world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers, based at Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research - used 200m data points across Antarctica and 14.3m across Greenland, all collected by CryoSat, to study how the ice sheets there had changed over the past three years. The satellite carries a high-precision altimeter, which sends out short radar pulses that bounce off the ice surface and then back to the satellite. By measuring the time this takes, the height of the ice beneath the spacecraft can be calculated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was found from the average drops in elevation that were detected by CryoSat that Greenland alone is losing about 90 cubic miles a year, while in Antarctica the annual volume loss is about 30 cubic miles. These rates of loss - described as &quot;incredible&quot; by one researcher - are the highest observed since altimetry satellite records began about 20 years ago, and they mean that the ice sheets' annual contribution to sea-level rise has doubled since 2009, say the researchers whose work was published in the journal Cryosphere last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have found that, since 2009, the volume loss in Greenland has increased by a factor of about two, and the West Antarctic ice sheet by a factor of three,&quot; said glaciologist Angelika Humbert, one of the study's authors. &quot;Both the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic peninsula, in the far west, are rapidly losing volume. By contrast, East Antarctica is gaining volume, though at a moderate rate that doesn't compensate for the losses on the other side of the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers say they detected the biggest elevation changes caused by ice loss at the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, which was recently found to be shifting ice into the oceans faster than any other ice-sheet glacier, and at Pine Island glacier, which like other glaciers in West Antarctica, has been thinning rapidly in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discovery of these losses of ice is particularly striking and represents yet another blow to claims by some climate-change deniers, who argue that the rapid loss of ice in the Arctic currently being observed is being matched by a corresponding increase in Antarctica. CryoSat's measurements show that Antarctica - although considerably colder than the Arctic because of its much higher average elevation - is not gaining ice at all. Indeed, it is - overall - losing considerable volumes, and in the case of West Antarctica is doing so at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This point was stressed by Mark Drinkwater, the European Space Agency's CryoSat mission scientist. &quot;These results offer a critical new perspective on the recent impact of climate&nbsp;change on large ice sheets. This is particularly evident in parts of the Antarctic peninsula, where some of the more remarkable features add testimony on the impact of sustained peninsula warming at rates several times the global average.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOUSTON -- The McCarty Road Landfill is an unwelcome mountain in this flat city: The giant mound covered by sand and grass towers over the Settegast neighborhood of Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the tallest man-made structure in this area, hands down,'' Robert D. Bullard, the dean of the school of public affairs at Texas Southern University, said as he drove through the mostly low-income, minority neighborhood that surrounds the landfill. (The university is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little has changed in the three decades since Dr. Bullard completed a study showing that most of Houston's waste facilities -- landfills, incinerators and transfer stations -- were located in predominantly minority neighborhoods. As the city considers a radical plan for boosting its dismally low recycling rate, which might put a new waste-sorting plant near an existing landfill, Dr. Bullard worries that legacy will continue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At what point do you stop dumping on communities that have already got five landfills and five incinerators,'' he asked, ''and stop using the argument that they're already dirty?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houston's ''One Bin for All'' proposal, which would let residents throw their trash and recycling into a single bin instead of separating them first, has been debated for months. Supporters, including some national climate&nbsp;change organizations, believe the plan could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and costs. They say it would cut truck traffic, because there would be no need for two pickups, and argue that sorting trash from recyclables at a centralized facility is more effective than relying on residents to do it themselves. Today, Houston recycles only 6 percent of the waste it collects, compared with the national average of 34.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detractors like the Sierra Club and paper and steel industry groups say it cannot be done cost effectively and represents an outdated approach to waste management. They say the city should focus on expanding its recycling service and charging a garbage fee, which it has never done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, critics have seized on another aspect of the plan: where the new sorting facility would be located. While the bids from several companies vying are sealed, city officials say it makes sense to locate the facility near an existing landfill. Dr. Bullard and others fear that the McCarty landfill, which is operated by a company that also submitted a bid for the ''One Bin'' project, could be a prime target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Spanjian, Houston's director of sustainability, said the proposed sorting center would be nothing like a landfill. It would be more like an advanced manufacturing facility, she said, and while it would receive a fair amount of truck traffic, it could actually improve the quality of life for neighborhoods near existing landfills by diverting waste away from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The less waste we put into these landfills, the better this is going to be for the neighborhoods,'' Ms. Spanjian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials are quick to note that it has been decades since a new major landfill was established in Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Dr. Bullard, who is joined in his opposition by the Houston chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., putting any waste-related facility in a predominantly minority neighborhood would feel like a slight. While community activists managed to get some landfills closed in those neighborhoods in the late 1960s and the 1970s, new facilities popped up to replace them, Dr. Bullard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalls an unsuccessful class-action lawsuit he joined in the late 1970s, after the city and a waste management company had established a landfill in a suburban, middle-class, mostly African-American neighborhood. Just a few years earlier, when the neighborhood was still mostly white, local officials had put a stop to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was too early and too soon to challenge something like this in a Southern town,'' Dr. Bullard said of the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the recycling plan say the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and truck traffic is an environmental justice issue, because climate&nbsp;change and air pollution can disproportionately affect poor and minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When there are separate collections for trash and recyclables, ''we run two separate sets of trucks, two crews, two sets of canisters,'' said Craig Benson, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who approves of the single-bin strategy. He added, ''If we can reduce that to a single stream, that's a real advantage.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to the slowdown in global warming in recent years lies in the depths of the Atlantic and Southern oceans where excess heat is being stored, not the Pacific as has previously been suggested, according to new research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the finding suggests that a naturally occurring ocean cycle burying the heat will flip in around 15 years' time, causing global temperature rises to accelerate again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slowdown in average surface temperature rises over the last 15 years after decades of rapid warming has been seized on by climate&nbsp;change sceptics and has puzzled scientists, who have hypothesised that everything from volcanic eruptions and sulphur from Chinese power stations to heat being trapped deep in the oceans could be the cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several studies have focused on the Pacific as potentially playing a major role. But the study, published yesterday in the journal Science, concludes that the Pacific alone cannot explain the warming &quot;hiatus&quot;, and that much of the heat being trapped by the greenhouse gases at record levels in the atmosphere is being sunk hundreds of metres down in the Atlantic and Southern oceans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ka-Kit Tung, author of the paper and University of Washington professor, said: &quot;The finding is a surprise, since the current theories had pointed to the Pacific Ocean as the culprit for hiding heat. But the data are quite convincing and they show otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not downplaying the role of the Pacific,&quot; he said. &quot;They are both going on; one is short term (the Pacific), one is long term (the Atlantic).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other climate scientists, unconnected to the study, said the work did not dispel evidence of a key role for the Pacific in the warming slowdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tung's study says that as surface water in the north Atlantic becomes saltier it becomes more dense, sinking and taking surface heat down to depths of more than 300 metres, with the process reversing every 30 years or so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using temperature data from floats across the world, Tung found the Atlantic and Southern oceans &quot;each account for just under half the global energy storage change since 1999 at below 300 metres&quot;. The study's result, he says, does not support the &quot;Pacific-centric&quot; view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jon Robson, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: &quot;The hiatus really is a patchwork problem of lots of different things - volcanoes, the Pacific, the Atlantic. This paper does elevate the Atlantic's role, which has been largely ignored before. But there's a lot more to it than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't dispel the key role for the Pacific in the hiatus. There is evidence that the hiatus is a northern hemisphere winter phenomenon, which does point the finger quite strongly to the Pacific.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piers Forster, professor of climate&nbsp;change at the University of Leeds, said: &quot;Their ideas seem fine, but I'm also convinced there is more going on: the El Nino and relative cooler European and Asian winters remain important aspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most importantly, this paper is another a nail in the coffin of the idea that the hiatus is evidence that our projections of long term climate&nbsp;change need revising down. Variability in the ocean will not affect long-term climate trends but may mean we have a period of accelerated warming to look forward to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: It's hard to pin down exactly what prime minister Tony Abbott really believes on climate change, but his policies could only have been developed by someone who believes global warming is a hoax.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps nothing better exemplifies the spinelessness, hypocrisy and turpitude of prime minister Tony Abbott's position on climate&nbsp;change than his comments on 3AW in December 2009: &quot;Climate&nbsp;change is real. But I think there are lots of legitimate questions about its extent, how much humans are causing it, and certainly there is a very real and necessary debate about the mechanism for dealing with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott made this sneering reference to climate science and global climate&nbsp;change mitigation efforts one day after becoming the leader of the Liberal party, prevailing over Malcolm Turnbull by a single vote. Just a day before, the policy position of that party was support for an emissions trading scheme and acknowledgement of the dangers posed by global warming that had been long confirmed by the scientific community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events that precipitated Abbott's comments are important, because they reveal the character of the man who is now prime minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month before, on 9 November, senior senator and climate denier Nick Minchin appeared on the Four Corners program on the ABC. Minchin suggested that a global left-wing conspiracy was behind climate&nbsp;change. Minchin encouraged the extreme fringe elements of the Liberal and National parties to speak out against Turnbull: &quot;I don't mind being branded a sceptic about the theory that that human emissions and CO2 are the main driver of global change - of global warming. I don't accept that and I've said that publically. I guess if I can say it, I would hope that others would feel free to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several senators did so, including ultra-conservative South Australian Liberal senator Cory Bernardi and Victorian Liberal senator Julian McGuaran, who threatened to cross the floor against any emissions trading deal negotiated by Turnbull. The climate denier caucus delivered Abbott the votes he needed to defeat the moderate Turnbull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having become leader by the grace of this extreme fringe element, Abbott was pandering the day after his elevation to Liberal leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in his pandering, Abbott was hedging. The polls showed that most Australians supported climate action, so he could not, like Minchin, come out directly and deny it was real. Instead, he used talking points imported from the USA designed to cast uncertainty and doubt on the reality of climate&nbsp;change, without denying it outright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments received relatively little coverage, as they were caught up in the maelstrom of debate and coverage of the fallout of the Liberal leadership spill, the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation in the senate and the global disappointment in Copenhagen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Abbott's comments are illustrative. Their purpose was to dissimulate and deceive, to undermine the very notion that anything could or should be done to address or mitigate global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott's real views are hard to pin down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well before the leadership spill, Abbott has come out on the climate denialist side, saying in July 2009 &quot;I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate&nbsp;change.&quot; In October that year, he again used a climate denialist talking point to try to undermine confidence in the scientific community, saying to Channel 9 &quot;I think that the science is far from settled&quot;. He repeated the lie about global cooling, which has been recently picked up by his chief business advisor Maurice Newman, saying:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the world has cooled slightly since the late 1990s. One of the things which I think has disconcerted a lot of people is the evangelical fervour of the climate&nbsp;change alarmists because they haven't pursued their case with the kind of careful moderation that you normally associate with the best scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet just a few months before, possibly before there was an inkling that he could become Liberal leader, Abbott said in a Sky News interview on 29 July: &quot;If you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on the 2UE radio station on 27 November, in the lead up to the leadership spill and just days after a rancorous caucus debate and a failed leadership bid by Kevin Andrews, Abbott said &quot;You can't have a climate&nbsp;change policy without supporting this ETS at this time.&quot; He challenged Turnbull to the leadership on that same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly the most revealing statement made by Abbott is his infamous climate&nbsp;change is &quot;crap&quot; line. He said to a small audience with a local reporter present in October 2009: &quot;The argument [on climate&nbsp;change] is absolute crap... however, the politics of this are tough for us. 80 per cent of people believe climate&nbsp;change is a real and present danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, perhaps, we glimpse the truth behind Abbott's changing position on climate&nbsp;change action. It comes down, not values or morality, but &quot;the politics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inconsistency, weasel words and hedging has continued over the last five years. During the most toxic periods of Abbott's scare campaign against the carbon price, he still declined to fully deny the reality of global warming. For example, he said on the ABC on 9 November 2011 &quot;I think that climate&nbsp;change is real, mankind does make a contribution and we should have strong and effective policies to deal with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a month earlier in an interview with Alan Jones on 2GB, he equated the scientific consensus on global warming to &quot;theology&quot; - a common denialist talking point:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALAN JONES: Shouldn't there be open and intelligent debate in a science which is not settled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TONY ABBOTT: Well, Alan, I certainly accept that there's been far too much theology and not enough proper scientific scepticism in this area, I certainly accept that...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently on the global stage, Abbott still vacillates between repeating denialist talking points and more moderate statements accepting the reality of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting with Barack Obama for example on 13 June this year, Abbott said in an ABC radio interview that &quot;I regard myself as a conservationist&quot;, yet later that day would front an audience in Texas to laud the unrestrained burning of fossil fuels:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia should be an affordable energy superpower, using nature's gifts to the benefit of our own people and the wider world. It is prudent to do what we reasonably can to reduce carbon emissions. But we don't believe in ostracising any particular fuel and we don't believe in harming economic growth. Energy consumption defines prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this is surprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott's chief business advisor Maurice Newman is a well-known climate denier. The main political sponsor of Abbott was outspoken climate denier Nick Minchin. Abbott's finance minister Mathias Cormann visited the USA to meet with conservative climate denialist think tanks like the Heritage Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Substantial donations are made to the Liberal party by the fossil fuel industry, almost $13 million according to Charles Sturt University academic Clive Hamilton. Major donors to the LNP since 2010 include Hancock Coal (owned by Gina Rinehart), Minerology (owned by former LNP Queensland president and life-member Clive Palmer), Caltex, Chevron, QCoal, Santos and Woodside. Also contributing to the LNP were energy retailers AGL, Origin Energy and Energy Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since becoming prime minister, Abbott has been very focused on delivering for this key business constituency. Just as, in 2009 after his victory over Turnbull, he fronted the media to cast doubt on the reality of global warming, after his election victory in 2013 he has set about dismantling Australia's carbon pricing and climate mitigation policy framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fig-leaf for Abbott is his &quot;direct action&quot; policy, to pay polluters to reduce their carbon emissions. This is such a laughably inadequate policy, it could only be supported by a prime minister and political party that believes global warming to be a hoax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott has been described as a weather vane by his Liberal party colleagues in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has supported a carbon tax, then viciously opposed any price on carbon to appease a minority hard-core fringe. He has dismantled Australia's emissions trading scheme and internationally has allied with fossil-fuel addicted nations like Canada to block meaningful global action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet while doing this, he boldly declares himself to be a conservationist and that he considers climate&nbsp;change to be a &quot;significant problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no other conclusion to draw that on the issue of global warming, Abbott is a climate nihilist. He holds no conviction or moral position on this issue of international and intergenerational significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a climate nihilist could so viciously attack the measures introduced under the previous government that were designed to assist people on low incomes, prevent harm to peoples' livelihoods and the economy, and to (in some small way) mitigate the global climate catastrophe. On this issue, it appears that he believes in nothing and therefore cannot come to a moral judgement or sense any moral obligation to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gesture of &quot;direct action&quot; is the most contemptible element of his nihilism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- The threats from climate&nbsp;change are many: extreme weather, shrinking snowpack, altered ecosystems and rising and more acidic seas, to name a few. Another lesser-known issue may hit especially close to home for city dwellers. In the world's already smoggy metropolises, pollution is likely to grow worse, a phenomenon scientists have taken to calling the climate penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ozone is a key culprit. This lung-damaging compound, often formed from chemical reactions involving sunlight and automobile exhaust and other pollution, plagues major cities around the globe. As the climate heats up, it is projected that more ozone will form in polluted areas on sweltering days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have a hot summer, you're going to get a lot of ozone,'' said Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanation lies in chemistry. Ozone, formed by a sunlight-aided reaction of volatile organic compounds with nitrogen oxides, is created more quickly at higher temperatures, as was evident during the European heat wave of 2003. Climate&nbsp;change will also make the air more stagnant in some areas like the East Coast of the United States, Dr. Jacob said, because with the Arctic getting warmer more quickly than the tropics, air circulation between those two regions will slow. In a warmer world, plants may also produce more emissions that are precursors to ozone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 2009 paper in the journal Atmospheric Environment, Dr. Jacob and another researcher found that ''climate&nbsp;change alone will increase summertime surface ozone in polluted regions by 1-10 parts per billion over the coming decades, with the largest effects in urban areas and during pollution episodes.'' (The United States standard for ozone is 75 parts per billion, though many experts say it should be lower to protect health.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the projections for ozone are not uniformly bad. Scientists predict that the climate penalty will mainly affect already polluted cities, where ozone is formed locally. But because a warmer climate means more airborne water vapor, which can dismantle ozone through a series of chemical reactions, the background level of ozone -- that not created by man -- at the earth's surface is expected to fall. This means that sparsely populated areas, which produce less pollution, may escape the climate penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, for example, southern areas are expected to see climate&nbsp;change lead to higher ozone (assuming emissions stay the same), whereas the thinly populated Nordic region could feel no impact or even see improvements, according to Joakim Langner, an associate professor at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Southern Europe not only produces more ozone-forming emissions, but it is also projected to become drier and sunnier, Dr. Langner said -- conditions conducive to ozone formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In China, a similar regional split is expected to emerge. Eastern China, home to megacities like Shanghai and Beijing, is likely to see an increase in ozone problems, whereas western China can expect lower levels, scientists project. The ozone in western China is largely produced elsewhere, allowing water vapor in the atmosphere an opportunity to dismantle the ozone through a series of chemical reactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phenomenon of an increase in climate-linked ozone is likely to hold true for other big, polluted Asian cities, like those in Japan or India, said Amos Tai, an assistant professor in the Earth System Science Program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists are most certain of the trajectory of ozone, but other health-damaging air pollutants may also be affected by climate&nbsp;change. Attention is turning to soot and other fine particles, which can lodge in the lungs and cause long-term harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In areas prone to drought, the climate may also worsen soot-spewing wildfires, as is the case this year in the western United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In China, where fine particles are already a huge problem for big cities, a change in winter monsoon patterns could bring less clean air from eastern Siberia, and ''that would favor more pollution over eastern China,'' said Yuxuan Wang, an assistant professor of atmospheric chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University, Galveston. A changing monsoon could also affect South Asia's pollution distribution, she said. However, the future of monsoon patterns is uncertain under existing climate models, Dr. Wang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another key question, researchers say, is what the effects will be from dust swept off major deserts and transported around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even on ozone further study is needed, said Ruth Doherty, a reader in atmospheric sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. ''Ozone is still a key area of research in the context of climate&nbsp;change impacts because it is strongly coupled to meteorological conditions and hence climate,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlos Ordonez, who works on regional air quality modeling for the Met Office in Britain, points out that most records for ozone and other air pollutants are relatively short, compared with temperature data, so longer-term information is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the threat of a climate penalty looming, of course, added impetus is on the world's nations to reduce their emissions of air pollutants from factories and motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's decision last month to repeal a carbon tax on its biggest greenhouse gas polluters disheartened scientists and advocates of strong action to control greenhouse gas emissions -- not least island nations in the South Pacific worried about rising sea levels. And it sends a discouraging signal in advance of a United Nations summit meeting on climate&nbsp;change for heads of state on Sept. 23, an important curtain-raiser for next year's Paris summit meeting aimed at a new global treaty to limit emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carbon tax covered industries ranging from mining and aviation to power plants; during its brief existence, emissions went down. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who made abolishing the tax a centerpiece of his campaign, warned of sharp increases in electricity prices and manufacturing costs in the years ahead, and enough members of the Senate believed him to repeal the tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's energy policy is now essentially in shambles. Absent a carbon price or comparably effective policy, Australia's chances of meeting its commitment to reduce emissions by at least 5 percent below 2000 levels by 2020 seem dim. Some politicians have suggested an emissions trading scheme, like those in Europe and parts of the United States. That's a long shot. Mr. Abbott's government has proposed a new Emissions Reduction Fund to encourage industry to buy energy from cleaner sources. But, as his critics note, quite rightly, repealing the carbon tax makes Australia's supply of coal even cheaper to burn while weakening incentives for renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differences between Mr. Abbott and his predecessors are striking. In 2007, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called climate&nbsp;change the ''greatest moral challenge of our time.'' Mr. Abbott seems more concerned with the challenges that a carbon tax would pose for his friends in the coal industry. ''For many decades at least,'' he has said, ''coal will continue to fuel human progress as an affordable, dependable energy source for wealthy and developing countries alike.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when President Obama is seeking emissions limits on new and existing power plants, and when many scientists are arguing for major reductions in fossil-fuel use by 2050 to keep global warming within manageable limits, Australia -- among the world's highest emitters per capita of carbon dioxide -- has chosen to become an outlier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GIANT public relations agency that has been under fire for a couple of gaffes in the last couple of weeks says it is taking steps to try to make sure such blunders do not recur -- the kinds of steps it would recommend to clients in the same predicaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What the leadership team decided,'' Ben Boyd, president for practices, sectors and offerings at Edelman in New York, said in an interview on Friday, is that ''we will treat ourselves like we treat a client.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Lesson learned,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Just because you advise clients on the complexities of today's world, that doesn't mean they're easier to manage,'' Mr. Boyd said, adding that ''it would have been smart'' to have had in place at Edelman some of the internal protocols and processes that the agency's 5,000 employees suggest that clients adopt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edelman, the largest independent public relations firm in the world by revenue, found itself having to re-examine its procedures after two episodes that generated unwelcome media attention. The first involved the agency's response to a survey of large public relations agencies, conducted by The Guardian and an organization called the Climate Investigations Center, about representing clients that deny climate&nbsp;change. The second incident, less fraught than the first, was centered on a blog post suggesting that the suicide of Robin Williams represented ''an opportunity'' for a national conversation about depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian, in an article on Aug. 4, reported that Edelman, unlike many of its competitors, ''did not explicitly rule out taking on climate deniers as clients,'' and included a sentence that read, ''An initial response to C.I.C. from Edelman inadvertently included an internal email which said: 'I don't believe we are obligated in any way to respond. There are only wrong answers for this guy.' '' The article was illustrated with what was described as a screen grab of the conversation inside Edelman showing that the email had been written by Mark Hass, who was at the time United States president and chief executive of Edelman. He left the agency last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian published a follow-up article on Aug. 7 reporting on a subsequent statement on the Edelman website in which the agency said it ''fully recognizes the reality of and science behind climate&nbsp;change'' and does not ''accept client assignments that aim to deny climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two related articles by Brian Merchant were on the Motherboard channel of Vice, one on Aug. 5 castigating Edelman and one on Tuesday about a telephone call from Richard Edelman, president and chief executive of Edelman, to Mr. Merchant, during which, Mr. Merchant wrote, Mr. Edelman told him that Edelman had ''fired'' Mr. Hass ''in part because of that stupid note he wrote'' and describing Mr. Hass as ''the ham-head who filled out the questionnaire to be a little, uh, slick.'' (Earlier, in a blog post, Mr. Edelman said that the agency ''did a poor job of filling out'' the questionnaire.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in turn, brought online articles questioning Edelman from publications like O'Dwyer's and PR Week because, when it was reported in April that Mr. Hass would leave the agency, his departure was described by Edelman as his stepping down rather than as a dismissal. ''It wasn't the best interview I've ever seen,'' said Steve Barrett, editor in chief of PR Week, referring to Mr. Edelman's conversation with Mr. Merchant. ''It certainly wouldn't be in line with the media training they give their clients.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an email statement on Friday, Mr. Edelman, who took issue with the first Motherboard article in his blog post, wrote this about the second article: ''In a recent interview my intention was to simply clarify Edelman does not accept client assignments that deny climate&nbsp;change. I regret several of the remarks I made beyond that.'' Mr. Hass could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't feel sorry for Edelman for mishandling'' the questionnaire, said Kert Davies, executive director of the Climate Investigations Center in Washington, because inquiries about climate-change policies ''have been posed multiple times for 20 years'' to other companies in fields like energy, transportation and consumer products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although how Edelman handled the matter was ''a bit of shooting one's own feet,'' Mr. Davies said, and cast shadows ''on a firm that handles crisis communications'' for others, ''I'm not gloating.'' He said, however, that he remained skeptical about Edelman's eschewing of climate denial when the agency works for clients like the American Petroleum Institute. Mr. Barrett of PR Week estimated that 10 to 15 percent of ''the business in the P.R. industry comes from energy companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the blog post after Mr. Williams's death, Mr. Barrett said he believed it ''was written in good faith,'' adding, ''Personally, I don't think it was a crass attempt to cash in on a tragedy.'' The post described ''a very careful line'' that mental health professionals and people with depression ''need to walk so as to not seem exploitive of a terrible situation'' and added, in parentheses, ''We too are balancing that line with this post.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boyd of Edelman said, ''We should have been more thoughtful about the headline'' -- it read, ''Carpe Diem,'' quoting a line from the Williams film ''Dead Poets Society'' -- ''and about the timing of the post.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency apologized in a post on its Twitter account. ''We talk to clients about being nimble, about being engaged in real time,'' Mr. Boyd said, but there ought to be ''checks and balances in place'' to address problems as they arise or prevent them from intensifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've already asked a team'' inside Edelman ''to look at issues, reputation management issues, that we as a firm have,'' he added, and that examination will be ''global in nature and across all our areas.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government has indicated a strong desire -- and made some specific proposals -- to reduce its reliance on coal, a step that would be a welcome development for the Chinese people and the planet as a whole. But there is a lot we don't know yet about Beijing's strategy and whether it will be bold enough to have a meaningful effect on local air quality and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-owned news outlets reported this month that the government would ban the use of coal in Beijing and other urban areas by 2020 in an effort to reduce the noxious air pollution that chokes many cities. In July, a Chinese academic who is also a senior lawmaker said the government was considering a national cap on coal use as soon as 2016.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China is the world's largest consumer of coal, using about 45 percent of the global total. It is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. So China's energy policies will be crucial to limiting the damage from climate&nbsp;change. It's thus welcome news when President Xi Jinping says that reducing pollution will be a priority for his administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he and other officials have provided few details -- and, indeed, have sent conflicting, even disturbing, signals about their plans. Some measures China is considering could actually exacerbate climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particularly misguided plan, for instance, would involve building 50 large industrial facilities in western China to convert coal into synthetic natural gas. This would help the government reduce air pollution in Beijing and Shanghai by replacing coal-fired power plants with cleaner gas facilities. But the process of converting coal to gas would increase the country's total carbon emissions and consume huge amounts of water in what are already arid regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Greenpeace report estimated that the 50 plants China is planning to build could spew as much as 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air every year, or about one-eighth of the country's total emissions in 2011. The country already has two coal-to-gas plants in operation, is building three more and has approved the construction of 16 others. China and the world cannot afford the damage these plants will cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, there is no shortage of familiar strategies -- many already deployed in other countries -- that could enable China to reduce its use of coal in ways that would benefit both its cities and the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can do a lot more to encourage industry and consumers to use energy more efficiently; the country's economy still uses more energy to generate each unit of output than the world average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China itself, much like Europe and some states in the United States, has recently begun regional emission trading systems. If strengthened, China's systems could play an important role in encouraging efficiency. Officials have also talked about imposing a carbon tax, which could push industries toward cleaner fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country can also do more to tap into shale gas in a prudent way. By some estimates, China's shale reserves could be nearly twice as big as American reserves. China will also need to invest more in renewable energy sources and nuclear power to meet the needs of its large and increasingly urban population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wretched air in China's cities is forcing Chinese officials to change their energy policies. If they do a good job tackling local pollution, they could also have a big impact on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Reducing Carbon by Curbing Population'' (Economic Scene column, Aug. 6):</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eduardo Porter makes some valid points about the link between population growth and increases of greenhouse gases. But while there are reasons to support a voluntary decrease in fertility rates in developing countries, including Africa's, that may not be the most efficient way to slow climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries that have slowed population growth not only have not decreased their emissions, but they generally have also increased them significantly. This is because declines in fertility, due to empowerment, education, gender equality and access to sexual and reproductive health, are part and parcel of development and economic growth. Given our reliance on fossil fuels, economic growth may mean more emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no shortcuts to tackling climate&nbsp;change, we must transform production and consumption and move toward renewable energy sources. For this, we will need an educated, empowered and healthy global population to innovate our way to sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we invest in people, including in their reproductive health, population growth in high-fertility countries will slow, and we will be better able to face the climate challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONOLULU -- After months of crisis diplomacy over the Middle East and Ukraine, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that President Obama had asked him to redouble his diplomatic efforts in Asia and the Pacific through the remainder of his administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As secretary of state, my job isn't just to respond to crises,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's also about defining and seizing the long-term opportunities for the United States.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2009, the Obama administration has emphasized that it is in the process of rebalancing American foreign policy to give more emphasis to Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that theme often seems to have taken a back seat, given crises in Egypt, Gaza, Syria and Iraq, as well as Mr. Kerry's frustrated effort to pursue an Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty and the possibility of direct Russian intervention in Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the East-West Center here in what the State Department billed as an important address on Asia policy, Mr. Kerry outlined an ambitious policy agenda for a region that is of increasing economic importance to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are in this for the long haul, cleareyed about the challenges ahead,'' Mr. Kerry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States' long-term objectives for the Asia and Pacific region, he said, included encouraging economic growth to generate jobs for a young population and developing clean energy to combat the effects of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other key goals, Mr. Kerry cited promoting regional cooperation, defusing tensions in the South China Sea, standing up for human rights and ''empowering people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry delivered the speech at the end of a round-the-world trip that included visits to Myanmar, Australia and the Solomon Islands. In his previous trip abroad, Mr. Kerry made a two-day visit to India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those trips illustrated some of the challenges Mr. Kerry would face even if he were to devote all of his energies to the Asian and Pacific region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Myanmar, Mr. Kerry met with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and opposition leader. Mr. Kerry noted that ''she is now free to speak her mind as a member of Parliament.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Mr. Kerry met with her on Sunday, she stressed her concerns about the prospects for continued political reform in Myanmar, a nation that is still dominated by its former military rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The United States is going to do everything we can to help reformers'' in Myanmar, Mr. Kerry said in his speech on Wednesday, ''especially by supporting nationwide elections next year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to the Solomon Islands earlier this week, Mr. Kerry saw the erosion and damage caused by a major storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Pacific islands across the entire Pacific are especially vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change,'' Mr. Kerry said, adding that the United States and China have a special role to play in reducing emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Delhi two weeks ago, Mr. Kerry held the Obama administration's first high-level meeting with India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, and sought to strengthen economic and security ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to the United States' frustration, Indian officials declined to withdraw objections to a global trade accord unless a parallel understanding was reached that allowed the Indian government to subsidize and stockpile grains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations last weekend in Myanmar, Mr. Kerry sought to ease tensions in the South China Sea by calling for a freeze of activities that ''would complicate or escalate disputes.'' The final statement from the Asean meeting, however, did not specifically mention China or a freeze. Mr. Kerry noted in his speech here that he was nonetheless pleased that the member nations had agreed it was time ''to seek consensus'' on which destabilizing actions should be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the continuing crises elsewhere, the notion that Mr. Kerry will have the time to intensify his efforts in Asian diplomacy has been met with some skepticism by veteran observers, which the secretary inadvertently fueled with a casual comment at the start of his address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry, who arrived late for the address, told the crowd that during the drive over, he had been making phone calls on the situation in Gaza.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A London assembly review of performance on cutting the capital's carbon emissions exposes holes in the mayor's strategy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in 2014 the London assembly environment committee produced a report card on the progress of the capital's carbon reduction targets. It gave mayor Boris Johnson an overall score of just 4.6 out of 10 for his efforts to reduce carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite benefiting from some of the best and most comprehensive climate policies and the efforts of his climate team, Johnson - now in the middle of his second term of office - has failed to show the personal leadership that his climate mitigation and adaptation strategies promise. By not putting the weight of his office and resources behind his pledge to reduce London's carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, long-term targets will prove even harder to achieve.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This overall poor performance is not surprising, given the mayor's reluctance to acknowledge human behaviour as the dominant cause of climate&nbsp;change. Instead the mayor is known to give credence to crank theories, such as solar activity being the cause and speculation over whether we are entering a mini ice age. This dangerous and ill-informed mindset also explains the mayor's rationale for promoting the development of new sources of carbon emissions such as aviation expansion and fracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a mixed picture: good progress in some areas is cast against stark underachievement in others, such as retrofitting homes and workplaces for energy efficiency and decentralised energy generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 36% of London's emissions from domestic properties, energy efficiency is essential to deliver the capital's carbon reduction ambitions. However, London is behind and the mayor does not expect to meet his 2015 target. On current performance, it is difficult to see grounds for confidence that he will meet his 2025 target either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On new buildings, planning policies have ensured energy efficiency has progressed ahead of target. Most of London's carbon emissions involve the energy supply industry, such as mains gas or electricity. The mayor has a target of obtaining 25% of the energy used in London's buildings from decentralised sources by 2025, predominantly from developing large combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating systems. However, Johnson expects to miss his 2015 milestone and the pipeline of future projects is far short of the delivery needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the failure to grasp the retrofit potential of solar generated electricity, I urged him to form a City Hall team to visit residents, community groups and businesses to offer advice and support. London should be harvesting solar-powered electricity from the underused and empty rooftops of London's commercial and industrial businesses, supermarkets, car parks, schools, transport, public buildings and other spaces. Yet only one in 260 London households has a solar installation, compared to one in 32 in the south-west of England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solar industry believes that at this time of year there is no reason why we cannot generate 30-40% of our electricity needs from this source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been traffic reduction of 11% since 2000, explaining much of the progress that has been achieved in the transport sector. However, there has been limited progress with low emission vehicles. The original aim of installing 25,000 electric charging points by 2015 was revised down to 1,300 - which has been exceeded, but we are still only 3% of the way towards the 100,000 electric vehicles on London's roads by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aims of Johnson's climate adaptation and mitigation strategies are to position London as an international leader in adapting to and mitigating climate&nbsp;change. Yet, when I questioned him about climate leadership in light of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC) five year assessment report, he confirmed they had made no public announcements or responses. Nor was the mayor able to supply details of any planned involvement in next year's UN climate&nbsp;change conference in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of urgency sends a message of complacency for others to follow. Ultimately, it will leave us and our infrastructure unable to cope with the impact of severe weather and take us one step closer to irreversible climate&nbsp;change beyond our adaptive capabilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trees are the giant sequoias, some of them 2,000 to 3,000 years old, and they are just one of several ancient Western species, including redwoods and bristlecone pines, that face a daunting future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the sequoias are not at immediate risk, even from California's current drought, scientists say they were not built to withstand decades of dry and warming weather. Their seedlings and saplings are susceptible to fires, which are likely to increase, especially at higher elevations. And if the drought persists, the lack of melting snow may keep the seedlings from developing a robust root system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If there's long-term drought, within 25 years, we could see seedlings in trouble,'' said Nathan Stephenson, an ecologist with the United States Geological Survey. ''In 50 years, the whole population could be in trouble,'' he went on, and within a century ''most of the big trees could be gone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sequoias are found in only one place on earth: the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. There are 65 to 70 groves, most in a narrow 70-mile band on the west side of the range at 5,000 to 8,000 feet. They include one tree here called the General Sherman, the world's largest by volume. Preservation efforts are hampered by the fact that so little is known about big trees, from their root systems to how they die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the climate&nbsp;changes, so do conditions in which sequoias and other big trees grow. The coastal redwoods of California, for example, are fog drinkers, taking as much as 40 percent of their water in through their needles. In the past half-century, the number of days in which the trees are shrouded by fog has declined by 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some places, that appears, paradoxically, to be contributing to increased growth: With less fog cover there is more light, said Todd E. Dawson, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley. But on the redwood range's southern and eastern edges, which are warmer and drier, scientists are documenting changes in the big trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are self-pruning,'' Dr. Dawson said. ''The crowns are beginning to thin out, and they are dropping needles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is one of a host of complex factors in the health of big trees. Many forests have been weakened from previous stresses, including habitat fragmentation, air pollution and selective breeding for timber. Warmer temperatures can also usher in disease and insects, along with fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristlecone pines -- at 4,000 years or more the oldest trees in the world -- have adapted to some of the harshest conditions on the continent. But rapid warming atop mountain ranges in Colorado, New Mexico and elsewhere has allowed bark beetles to gain a foothold. Once the bristlecones are infected, nothing can be done to save them. And although the beetle threat has waned of late, the pines have also been hit by blister rust, an invasive fungus from Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting such venerable trees is a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We might start irrigating the sequoias,'' Dr. Stephenson said, ''or we might build a giant fuel break around the giant sequoias, so if a fire came toward the grove, we could defend it. These things are getting hard discussion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sequoias are resilient. They have no disease or serious insect enemies, and their spongy bark, eight inches thick, is highly resistant to fires. One can lose 95 percent of its crown in a fire and recover. Still, no one knows what the climate future holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A novel program by Sierra Pacific Industries, a lumber producer and the largest landowner in California, has gathered cones from old-growth sequoia groves. In 2012, foresters started to plant seeds in 16 locations with different soil types, elevations and precipitation levels. Some 130,000 seedlings, the tallest three to four feet, are now growing from the ancient seeds. The company program is aiming to grow 1.4 million, even though sequoias have little timber value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The goal is to conserve the genetic diversity of the native groves'' should the old trees die, the program's coordinator, Glenn Lunak, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For bristlecone pines, biologists are collecting seeds from trees that appear resistant to blister rust, growing them in a test lab in Oregon and inoculating them with the fungal disease to gauge their resistance. If they contract the disease and survive, they will be planted as part of a new bristlecone forest among the old trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're trying to stay ahead of the rust and manage for resilience, rather than getting behind the curve and having to rebuild ecosystems impacted by high mortality,'' said Anna W. Schoettle, an ecologist with the United States Forest Service in Fort Collins, Colo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big trees are on the front lines of climate&nbsp;change. A 2012 study in the journal Science found that 100- to 300-year-old trees were dying at high rates around the world, in part because of hotter and drier weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a very, very disturbing trend,'' said an author of the paper, Bill Laurance, an environmental scientist at James Cook University in Australia. ''We are talking about the loss of the biggest living organisms on the planet, of organisms that play a key role in regulating and enriching our world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A world where a child can't stare up in wonder at a giant cathedral-like crown is a very real possibility.''</SPAN></P>

To stand nearly naked and heavy from winter on the water's edge, wade awkwardly into the shallows, dive under the first cold wave, taste first salt, surface and dive again to reach the calmer waters beyond, floating there until water and skin become the same temperature -- this is the best way I know to belong again, body and soul, to some larger part of the planet, not just the city, not just the job. But it's already August, and I still haven't gone swimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I teach, so I spent May reading student papers. When the school year ended and I caught up on the news, California was burning, Alaska melting and the Northeast soaking. The 2014 National Climate Assessment report explained that what we've been thinking of as the future is happening now. Then scientists announced that the West Antarctic ice sheet had begun to split apart, so the rising of ocean waters was pretty much irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Climate Assessment also argued that cutting emissions would still mitigate costs substantially, but Gallup reported that 25 percent of Americans were sure all this had nothing to do with greenhouse gases. Among evangelical Christians, it was 58 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, the bus stops of New York City were wrapped in signs that depicted rising floods and said ''Know Your Zone.'' I learned that my zone is Five. Beyond this, I was unsure what to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point in June, a friend and I stood aimlessly on a Brooklyn street corner. ''Dude,'' I said, ''New York is a beach town. We live in a beach town.'' He looked around at the heavy brick buildings, the plane trees and lindens, and chuckled. I did not say, ''The ocean is coming.'' I knew better than to get apocalyptic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion pieces about global-warming deniers did not, though: Faith was trumping reason in America, they said. Belief in God would bring on the deluge. This didn't help me know how to feel, living next to the rising ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Belong, body and soul.'' When I want to describe what swimming in the ocean feels like, this phrase comes to me. It is from the Heidelberg Catechism. As a child, when I felt scared, I'd repeat the first question -- What is your only comfort in life and in death? -- and answer to myself, ''That I am not my own, but belong -- body and soul, in life and in death -- to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My belief in this was the bridge between my otherwise insignificant life and the universe: I was not my own, but belonged to something bigger. But it also meant I was scared a lot. Atheists, evolutionary biologists, abortionists and climate scientists wanted to tear down that bridge -- or so I'd heard -- by denying that the history of the planet was God's story, not ours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hard to understand who would want to do this -- only arrogant people, people who presumed they could comprehend the world with merely human minds, who wanted to put their concerns at the center of the world, no matter the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sounds a lot like what everyone around me thinks now about global-warming deniers, fossil-fuel executives and the politicians who protect them. Others' skepticism can feel like the end of the world: They must be evil, they have all the power and what can we possibly do about it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know to be suspicious of apocalyptic thinking, my own and everyone else's. Numb denial of global warming will not do, but neither will helpless fear. I worry that among believers and deniers alike, blame is a way of avoiding a deeper problem, the problem of scale: How do we bridge the distance between our own seemingly insignificant lives and actions and the scale of climate&nbsp;change, so global and so slow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN Indiana, where I'm from, ocean beaches are a faraway thing, so as a child I learned to swim in a Y.M.C.A. pool. Later in life, it is easy to forget just how hard it is to figure out that you can trust the water. You must be calm and attentive exactly when you are most scared. This is why, when adults teach you to swim, they trick you. They say, ''Swim to me, I'm right here'' and then back up, so you learn with your body what is possible, despite what your mind is telling you. You have to trust things outside of yourself more than you trust your instincts: your parents, the floor, chairs, bicycles, water. God, and science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ought to help us empathize with global warming deniers, and not just among the faithful. Most evangelicals -- 76 percent -- don't even believe in natural selection, but then neither do 42 percent of all Americans. It is a long journey from finding science arrogant to being humbled by it, and it's only harder to make when you're being blamed for the end of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summer after I lost my faith, when I first began dreaming of New York, I got into the habit of driving to Lake Michigan alone, to swim. I couldn't yet fathom evolution and natural selection, which seemed to require more faith than the religion I'd left behind, so even though I could no longer believe in God, I had no good theory about how the world came to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In serious limbo, I went repeatedly to the edge of land and walked into the water. Floating until my skin was pruned, I felt my insignificance in the world next to the scale of the great lake and its long beaches, but at the same time, my actual physical connection to every molecule of it. Without knowing it, I was feeling out a new bridge between my life and the universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had begun to suspect that the story I'd left behind, the religious one, was the more human-centered one, and in its own way, arrogant, assuming as it did that the ways of the universe are like human ways: houses have to have builders, paintings have to have painters, the world must have a maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took many more years to start believing in evolution. I had to make a study of it, look at the finches myself, learn with my mind what I had felt in the water. Even when I knew the facts, it took a leap of faith to glimpse -- only ever in moments -- the interconnectedness of all life on an unfathomable scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to understand that the ways of the universe are not human ways. But it is hard, too, to face this ocean, so changed by us, without hiding in either fear or denial. To stay awake, active, useful, is a matter of feeling as much as knowing. You have to trust that your individual life is linked to something bigger: that you belong, body and soul, to a larger story for which you are responsible. In this, those of us who believe the science might take a lesson from the faithful. And the rhetoric that would pit faith against reason ignores the millions -- all of us, perhaps -- who live on both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is summer, whether or not I go to the beach. But soon I'll take a train to stand on the edge of the Atlantic, walk into the ocean I fear, and trust it to hold me up. I hope it will be a small kind of prayer for the future, less mystical than pragmatic, to feel in my body what is so hard to fathom: This vast and humbling contingency that's made the waters rise is also what makes my life matter, because other creatures -- human and otherwise -- will live in my wake. What threatens us is also our only comfort: It matters what we do. To swim in the ocean now is to swim into the future and know that we have made it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the heat, in the still gloaming, we set up camp near a snowbank across from a glacier and a symphony of waterfalls. North Cascades National Park, a few hours' drive from Seattle, can always be counted on as a compress to the rest of the country's fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, out of the park a few days later, down the valley to the arid east, it seems as if half of Washington State is on fire. Smoke, devastation, ashen orchards of charred fruit, standing dead pines. More than 250,000 acres have burned in the largest fire in the state's history, the Carlton Complex. About 300 homes have been destroyed. A small army of firefighters, at a cost of $50 million so far, is trying to hold the beast in the perimeter, between days when the mercury tops 100 degrees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this kind of loss comes blame. It's President Obama's fault. Why? Because everything is his fault in the inland West, where ignorance rides the airwaves of talk radio. Amid the conservative cant, a great irony: People who hate government most are the loudest voices demanding government action to save their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those flares will die down. What can't be so easily dismissed is what the fires say about an emerging American ethos of delaying long-term fixes for our major problems. Smart foresters had been warning for years that climate&nbsp;change, drought and stress would lead to bigger, longer, hotter wildfires. They offered remedies, some costly, some symbolic. We did nothing. We chose to wait until the fires were burning down our homes, and then demanded instant relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a Congress that won't legislate, an infrastructure that's collapsing, a climate bomb set to go off. We won't solve the immigration crisis even as desperate children throw themselves in the Rio Grande. Income inequality threatens to make a great democracy into an oligarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation that built an interstate highway system, and cleaned up its filthiest rivers and most gasp-inducing air, has become openly hostile to long-term investment or problem-solving, says Paul Roberts in ''The Impulse Society -- America in the Age of Instant Gratification,'' a cautionary tale to be published next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can make great plasma screens and seat warmers and teeth whiteners and apps that will guide you, turn by turn, to the nearest edgy martini bar,'' writes Roberts. ''But when it comes to, say, dealing with climate&nbsp;change, or reforming the financial system, or fixing health care, or some other large-scale problem out in the real world, we have little idea where to start.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an optimist, I was skeptical of Roberts's master narrative. The Gilded Age was a binge of self-indulgence by the few. The Roaring Twenties were a bathtub gin party that never closed until bounced by the Great Depression. ''Greed Is Good'' Wall Street ruled the Reagan years and beyond. We survived. Tried to get better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the wildfires of 2014 provide fresh evidence of Roberts's premise. Large burns in the decade through 2012 are five times more frequent than in the 1970s and early '80s. At the same time, the cost of battling those blazes has increased nearly fourfold since 1985; the federal government will most likely spend $2 billion this year acting as the nation's rural fire department. The agencies saddled with this duty don't have the money. And Republicans in Congress recently blocked consideration of emergency wildfire funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Western homeowners represented by those very Republicans are clamoring: Put the fires out, now! So federal agencies will have to borrow from funds that had been set aside for fire prevention in order to smother the fires this time. The government is expected to rush to the scene after any big natural disaster -- the impulse society at work. But there is no urgency to fix, or try to prevent, the overheated planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of not doing anything about the big picture, as numerous reports have documented, could be catastrophic in just a few years. With rising sea levels, bigger fires, and more lethal and powerful storms, you don't need an atmospheric scientist to know which way that wind is going to blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all share some of the blame; procrastination is part of our character of the moment. Still, if want to put a face on this inaction, you can look no further than the member of Congress whose district in Washington State is now choked by smoke and harassed by flames -- Cathy McMorris Rodgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is part of the leadership of a Republican majority that is hostile to the point of negligence on the basic science of climate&nbsp;change. Earlier this year, she complained that restoration work was not being done on 300,000 acres of the Colville National Forest (in her district) that are dying from beetle infestation. This is a huge problem. From Alaska to Mexico, billions of trees have died from an outbreak of bugs, ''the largest and most severe in recorded history,'' as the Forest Service called it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plague has been directly traced to climate&nbsp;change -- with drought, stress and warmer winters making it harder for the trees' natural defenses to fend off beetles. But the party of Cathy McMorris Rodgers will do nothing. It's a hoax, this warming talk, until one of its manifestations is nipping at the cedar decks of her constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fall, California will burn. Already, there have been more than 1,300 fires there. And the first seven months of 2014 were the warmest ever for the Golden State. This, at a time of its worst drought in modern memory. When the fires race through that lovely landscape, with all the media attention to the here-and-now but little to the elsewhere-and-future, only a fool will be surprised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the population explosion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When population was growing at its fastest rate in human history in the decades after World War II, the sense that overpopulation was stunting economic development and stoking political instability took hold from New Delhi to the United Nations' headquarters in New York, sending policy makers on an urgent quest to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s the Indian government forcibly sterilized millions of women. Families in Bangladesh, Indonesia and elsewhere were forced to have fewer children. In 1974, the United Nations organized its first World Population Conference to debate population control. China rolled out its one-child policy in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, almost as suddenly as it had begun, the demographic ''crisis'' was over. As fertility rates in most of the world dropped to around the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman -- with the one major exception of sub-Saharan Africa -- population specialists and politicians turned to other issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1994, when the U.N. held its last population conference, in Cairo, demographic targets had pretty much been abandoned, replaced by an agenda centered on empowering women, reducing infant mortality and increasing access to reproductive health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Some people still regret that; some applaud it,'' said Joel E. Cohen, who heads the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University in New York. ''I'm not sure we need demographic goals but we need forward thinking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, concerns about population seem to be creeping back. As the threat of climate&nbsp;change has evolved from a fuzzy faraway concept to one of the central existential threats to humanity, scholars like Professor Cohen have noted that reducing the burning of fossil fuels might be easier if there were fewer of us consuming them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Population wouldn't be the whole story but it could make a big difference,'' Mr. Cohen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article published in 2010 by researchers from the United States, Germany and Austria concluded that if the world's population reached only 7.5 billion people by midcentury, rather than more than nine billion, in 2050 we would be spewing five billion to nine billion fewer tons of carbon dioxide into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This alone would deliver 16 to 29 percent of the emission reductions needed over the next four decades to keep the global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above that of the late 19th century, the threshold scientists predict could lead to severe disruptions to the climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slower population growth could bring other benefits. The World Resources Institute has been looking into how the world will feed itself in 2050 without busting the carbon budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On current demographic and economic projections, food production would have to increase 70 percent by 2050. ''Population growth is responsible for about one-half of increased food consumption,'' said Tim Searchinger of the World Resources Institute. ''The other half comes from higher incomes and richer diets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the expected population growth is set in stone, but sub-Saharan Africa, expected to add 1.2 billion people by 2050 on top of its current 900 million, is an exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If fertility in sub-Saharan Africa slowed more rapidly than projected -- declining to 2.1 children per woman in 2050 from 5.4 today -- feeding the most undernourished region in the world would be a lot easier. And sparing African forests and woodlands from even greater deforestation would substantially reduce the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the benefits of slower population growth, population policies remain a highly touchy subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s and 1980s, rich nations' support for population control in poor countries smacked of just another form of colonialism. Coercive population control -- like India's forced sterilizations, which were abandoned after they led to the collapse of Indira Gandhi's government in 1977, or China's one-child policy, which remains in place -- is now widely considered a blatant violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even China's one-child policy is undergoing re-examination in Beijing because of the skewing of the country's sex ratio -- countless pregnancies have been aborted and millions of girls have been killed or left to die by parents who had hoped for a boy -- and the tearing of the traditional safety net from so many elderly Chinese being forced to rely on only one child for support. Economists at the International Monetary Fund have even welcomed Africa's fast-rising population as an opportunity to increase its pace of economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Population growth is only one factor -- and not necessarily the most important one -- contributing to global climate&nbsp;change. Over the course of the 20th century, emissions of carbon dioxide grew 180 percent faster than the population in poor countries and 60 percent faster than the population in rich ones. Shifting the world economy into more sustainable energy sources and away from fossil fuels is still the most promising strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a strong case to be made that the world faces sustainability issues whether it has nine billion people, seven billion people or four billion people,'' said John Wilmoth, who directs the United Nations Population Division. ''Nobody can deny that population growth is a major driving factor, but in terms of the policy response, what are you going to do?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there are ways to make a difference on the population front that do not depend on coercive governments straying into people's bedrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to education is critical. Across human history, fertility rates have fallen when it has made economic sense for families to have fewer children. Education -- especially of girls -- has played a powerful role in expediting the decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across much of the developing world, more educated women have fewer children, and their offspring are more likely to survive. The spread of public education was accompanied by plummeting fertility rates in such disparate places as Brazil and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other obvious tool is access to reproductive health. In the developing world, 222 million women have an unmet need for modern contraception, according to one study. Providing them with it, at a relatively small cost of $4 billion a year, could prevent 54 million unintended pregnancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are hardly new ideas. The U.N. population conference in Cairo 20 years ago suggested pretty much this approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are not there yet. Out of every 1,000 children born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, 99 die before the age of 5. In Nigeria, it is 123. A third of the girls in Mali are not enrolled in elementary school. Neither are 60 percent of Liberian girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, 95 percent of Guatemalan girls are enrolled in elementary school, as are 97 percent of Cambodian girls. In Bangladesh and Bolivia, among the poorest countries outside Africa, only about 40 of every 1,000 children die before they reach 5 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the General Assembly next month, the United Nations plans to hold a meeting to mark the anniversary of the Cairo conference. And it is organizing another to discuss new commitments to mitigate climate&nbsp;change. Perhaps delegates will notice the connection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's largest environmental group is earning money from an oil well on land it controls in Texas, despite pledging a decade ago not to permit new oil and gas drilling on land supposedly set aside for conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That revelation is contained in a forthcoming book about climate&nbsp;change by the writer and activist Naomi Klein, and the essential facts of the case were confirmed last week by the Nature Conservancy, the environmental group in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nature Conservancy -- which says it helps protect about 20 million acres in the United States -- argues that it has had no choice in the case of the well. Under the terms of a lease it signed years ago with an oil and gas company and later came to regret, the group says it had to permit the drilling of the well in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lease contains termination clauses, and Ms. Klein argues in the book that the Nature Conservancy could most likely have stopped the 2007 drilling. The group has earned millions of dollars over the years from gas and oil production on the property, though the 2007 well was not especially lucrative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property is supposed to be a refuge for the Attwater's prairie chicken, one of the most critically endangered birds in North America. The birds appear to have disappeared from the site, though it is unclear whether the drilling had anything to do with that. The Nature Conservancy contends it took exhaustive steps to protect the birds, which continue to exist in small numbers elsewhere in Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new book -- ''This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate'' -- is due for publication on Sept. 16, and word of Ms. Klein's finding has been filtering out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nature Conservancy ''has just lost its moral compass,'' said Kier&aacute;n Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, a group that works extensively on endangered species. ''The very idea of oil drilling inside a reserve is utterly wrong, and it's especially disturbing in this case because the Attwater's prairie chicken is one of the most endangered species in the entire country. It could very well be the next species to go extinct in the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James R. Petterson, a spokesman for the Nature Conservancy, said the organization would prefer to get out of the oil-and-gas business entirely, but that it had been unable to do so on the Texas property. Among the group's highest priorities is the conservation of the ecologically delicate lands it controls, he said, and its 3,600 employees are deeply committed to that cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than $6 billion in assets, the conservancy is by far the largest environmental organization in the United States. One of its basic strategies is to acquire ecologically threatened land, or rights to such land, in order to prevent or limit development. The group says it has helped to preserve more than 120 million acres around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the group's money has come from corporations, or wealthy donors with corporate ties. The group has been dogged for decades by questions about whether it is too close to those corporate interests, as well as whether it has permitted too much development and other economic use of its lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Texas property, known as the Texas City Prairie Preserve, has a complex history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobil Oil donated the 2,300-acre property, near Galveston Bay, to the Nature Conservancy in 1995, in a bid to save the Attwater's prairie chicken. That bird, known for its colorful mating dance, was once widespread on the Texas coastal prairies, but was devastated by hunting and destruction of its habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and oil were being produced on the Texas City property at the time the land was donated, but relatively far from the breeding grounds of the prairie chicken. In 1999, the Nature Conservancy's Texas chapter decided to permit new drilling there, with the idea of dedicating the money to prairie chicken conservation. It sought out a deal with an energy company and a new well was drilled, about a half-mile from the primary breeding grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drilling was exposed by The Los Angeles Times in 2002, and explored in more detail a year later by The Washington Post, in a series of articles that raised broad questions about the activities the Nature Conservancy was permitting on conservation lands. A two-year Senate investigation sharply criticized the Nature Conservancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group instituted reforms, including a pledge by its then-president that it would not permit new oil drilling or mining on its lands, and the managers of the organization have largely been replaced in the intervening years. The no-new-drilling pledge had one important caveat: that the conservancy would honor existing legal agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents show that the well on the Texas City preserve petered out in 2003, and efforts to revive it were abandoned in 2004. The oil company holding the lease sought to drill a replacement well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Petterson said the Nature Conservancy was reluctant to allow that, given the no-drilling pledge, and sought a legal opinion. An outside lawyer ruled that the terms of a 1999 lease, as well as a related legal settlement over royalties, effectively gave the oil company the right to drill again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal Nature Conservancy documents suggest that drilling and production on the property at times disturbed the Attwater's prairie chickens, despite the protections built into the lease. Yet the conservancy chose not to use that information to attempt to terminate the lease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Petterson acknowledged that the Nature Conservancy could have chosen to fight a legal battle with the drillers, but said the outcome would have been uncertain and perhaps costly to the environmental group. Instead, the conservancy permitted the drilling of a new well in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are living with the consequences of a 1999 decision,'' Mr. Petterson said, referring to the granting of the original lease. ''We would not make the same decision today.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The birds disappeared from the reserve in 2012, though the primary reason seems to have been a decision by the federal government to stop renewing the wild population with birds bred in captivity. Those birds are now being released at a larger preserve where they are thought to have a better chance of survival. Biologists have struggled to maintain a wild population above 100 birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her book, Ms. Klein questions whether the Nature Conservancy tried hard enough to escape the 1999 lease. She cites the Texas case in making a broader argument that certain environmental groups have been ineffective in fighting climate&nbsp;change because of corporate influence on their boards and finances, sometimes including direct influence from the fossil-fuel industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We all need to get off fossil fuels,'' Ms. Klein said in an interview. ''If the largest environmental organization in the world can't figure out how to stop pumping oil and gas, how are they going to help the rest of us figure it out?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Billions of baby oysters in the Pacific inlets here are dying and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington is busy spreading the bad news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It used to be the canary in the coal mine,'' Mr. Inslee said in a recent interview. ''Now it's the oyster in the half shell. You can't overstate what this means to Washington.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or to Mr. Inslee's ambitions. The Democratic governor, aided by what is expected to be millions of dollars from his billionaire friend Tom Steyer, is using the story of Washington's oysters -- scientists say a rise in carbon levels has spiked the acidity of the Pacific and is killing off shellfish -- to make the case for passing the most far-reaching climate&nbsp;change policies in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inslee, who is campaigning for his agenda across the state this summer with oyster farmers in tow, is trying to position himself as America's leading governor in the climate&nbsp;change fight. But Mr. Inslee does not have the support of the majority of the Washington State Senate, particularly those conservative lawmakers from the rural inland, so Mr. Steyer's advocacy group, NextGen Climate, is working with the Washington League of Conservation Voters to handpick Democratic, pro-climate policy candidates across the state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer's strategy is to spend heavily this fall to help defeat sitting lawmakers who oppose Mr. Inslee's agenda and pave the way for the governor to move his policies through next year -- an example, his critics say, of the insidious influence of big money from outsiders that makes local elections less local.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're working to give Jay the Legislature that he needs,'' said Gene Karpinski, president of the national League of Conservation Voters. ''The state senators are the obstacles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inslee discussed the strategy over lunch at the governor's mansion in May with Mr. Steyer, a retired California hedge-fund manager who has pledged to spend $100 million on climate issues in elections across the country this year. Mr. Inslee makes no apologies for Mr. Steyer's efforts on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Having a change in the State Senate would be a quantum shift in our ability to move forward,'' Mr. Inslee said. His plans, embraced by his liberal base in Seattle, include setting some of the toughest limits on carbon emissions in the country, joining with other states to cap carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer has not yet named the candidates or the State Senate districts he plans to target in Washington, but his strategists are eyeing about half a dozen key seats that could tip the majority of the State Senate in favor of Mr. Inslee's agenda. Right now the Senate has 24 Republicans, 2 Democrats who caucus with the Republicans and 23 other Democrats. Mr. Steyer has not said what he will spend in the districts, but his previous pattern indicates it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars for each candidate -- a huge amount for a Washington State race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, Mr. Steyer's group spent $275,000 in Washington to help ensure the election of four pro-environment candidates to the local council in Whatcom County, where candidates normally spend less than $25,000 for a single race. As a result, prospects are now dim for council approval of a proposed $600 million port in Whatcom near the border with British Columbia, which, if constructed, would facilitate the shipment of 48 million tons of coal annually to Asia from Montana and Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The port would be a lifeline for the states' coal producers, who anticipate the shutdown of American coal-fired power plants because of emissions limits proposed by the Obama administration and hope to send their coal via rail to the proposed Washington port. But Mr. Inslee and Mr. Steyer see them as a climate disaster in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer's money has not always bought results. In 2013 his group also spent $250,000 in a special election to try to oust Jan Angel, a Republican House member who opposes Mr. Inslee's climate plans, and was running for a state Senate seat last fall. But Ms. Angel raised money throughout the state and won the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Thank God that the people of my district were smart enough not to be purchased,'' Ms. Angel said. ''When you have people with deep pockets like Tom Steyer coming in and trying to trash candidates, spending this kind of money, it's a sad day for our democracy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are equally outraged. ''It's ridiculous that money coming from outside the state is trying to influence our votes,'' said Rick Tjoelker, an auto mechanic in Lynden, Wash., who bristled at Mr. Inslee's climate campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not a fan,'' Mr. Tjoelker said. ''What do you mean by climate&nbsp;change? I don't recognize that as a serious problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inslee said that views like Mr. Tjoelker's have convinced him that he has to use the dying oysters -- and the threat to a $270 million Pacific Northwest shellfish industry -- to sound alarms about climate&nbsp;change for people who ordinarily might not listen. Ocean acidification, he said, ''has the same cause as climate&nbsp;change, but it has been unsullied with the political controversy of climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inslee, the author of a book on renewable energy, ''Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy,'' has pushed for legislation to fight global warming since he served in the House of Representatives, where he introduced a climate&nbsp;change bill in the House in 2005 that went nowhere. In 2009 he pushed for a measure to create a national cap-and-trade program that would have cut carbon emissions from cars and power plants and forced companies to buy government-issued permits to pollute. That bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inslee argues that in the state of Microsoft and Boeing and where science and technology drive much of the economy, denying the science of climate&nbsp;change is a losing political stance. ''This is a scientifically literate state,'' Mr. Inslee said. Washington, he said, is positioned in a low-carbon economy to design and build new kinds of energy technology, like solar panels and software for the electric grid. ''It can be a jobs generator, and my state wants to get in the game,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his recent efforts he cites scientists who say that a global increase in carbon emissions from burning coal and oil has raised carbon dioxide levels in the oceans to unprecedented levels, translating to heavily acidic waters that are deadly to shellfish and other marine life. A major scientific report released in May, the National Climate Assessment, found that the United States' northwestern waters are among the world's most acidic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can attribute the problems in the oyster hatcheries to the increased carbon in the ocean,'' said Terrie Klinger, a professor of marine affairs at the University of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Washington's Pacific inlets, oyster farmers are trying to adapt to the acidic waters by pumping their oyster hatcheries full of alkaline chemicals. But scientists say the acidity levels are only going to keep rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have a nursery where we've set oysters continuously, but now they can't develop a healthy shell,'' said Paul Taylor, whose family has farmed oysters for five generations in Dabob Bay, a pine-fringed inlet. ''Right now, it's just hurting the babies, and in a controlled environment, we can manipulate the chemicals to get those through. But I don't know at what levels of acidification the adults won't grow. That unknown is very scary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Taylor, who said his 500-employee company is the largest shellfish supplier in the Pacific Northwest, said he knows the climate policies Mr. Inslee is pushing could increase his energy costs. ''I'm a businessman.'' he said. ''I know this could raise the cost of fuel for my boats and electricity for my buildings. But if this problem gets worse, and our oysters can't grow, then we just go away as a business.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some species might adjust to climate&nbsp;change better than predicted. Scientists transferred Australian rainforest flies (right) from their damp habitat to a dry environment. Some died, but surviving flies thatwere bred for five generations, produced offspring that withstood drier conditions for longer. A previous study using drier conditions killed all the flies, indicating they could only survive climate&nbsp;changes that weren't too sudden or drastic. Dr Belinda van Heerwaarden of Monash University said: &quot;We decreased the humidity to 35%, which is more relevant to predictions of how dry the environment will become in the next 30 years. We discovered when you change the environment, you get a totally different answer.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of left field</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercury and Earth are inner-solar, rocky planets with magnetic fields. But it seems the similarity ends there. Messenger, Nasa's Mercury-orbiting spacecraft, has revealed a magnetic field three times stronger at its north pole than its south. This is very different from the Earth's uniform field, which is generated by a spinning liquid outer core, turning into a solid iron inner core. A model produced by UCLA suggests Mercury's magnetic field is produced when, inside the planet's core, liquid iron turns solid on its outer boundaries. Planetary magnetic fields can be generated in more ways than one, it would seem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piecing together the past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 40,000-year-old mammoth ivory fragment depicting part of an animal's head has been unearthed in the Vogelherd Cave in south-west Germany. The ice-age fragment pictured below left makes up the other side of the head of a lion sculpture (below), uncovered there in the 1930s and originally mistakenly thought to be a wall carving. Prof Nicholas Conard of Tubingen University said: &quot;It is one of the most famous ice age works of art and, until now, we thought it was a relief. The reconstructed figurine clearly is a three-dimensional sculpture.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each new climate-change study seems more pessimistic than the last. This May and June, for example, were the hottest ones on record for the planet. Storms and droughts occur with increasing frequency. Glaciers are rapidly retreating, portending rising seas that could eventually displace hundreds of millions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective countermeasures now could actually ward off many of these threats at relatively modest cost. Yet despite a robust scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are at the root of the problem, legislation to curb them has gone nowhere in Congress. In response, President Obama has proposed stricter regulations on electric utilities, which some scientists warn may be too little, too late.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why aren't we demanding more forceful action? One reason may be the frequent incantation of a motley collection of myths, each one rooted in bad economics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 1: The enormous uncertainty of climate science argues for a wait-and-see strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim here is that reducing greenhouse gases would be a wasted expense if climate&nbsp;change ends up causing only minor problems. But uncertainty cuts two ways. Things might not be as bad as expected, but they could also be much worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other domains, uncertainty doesn't counsel inaction. Few people, for example, recommend disbanding the military simply because adversaries might not invade. In any event, many scientists now believe that storms and droughts caused by climate&nbsp;change are already causing enormous damage, so all that remains uncertain is how much worse things will get. And as Robert Shiller has written in this space, when the risk is as high as it now seems, economics tells us that insuring against worst-case calamities is prudent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 2: Slowing the pace of climate&nbsp;change would be prohibitively difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing CO2 emissions would actually be surprisingly easy. The most effective remedy would be a carbon tax, which would raise the after-tax price of goods in rough proportion to the size of their carbon footprint. Gasoline would become more expensive, piano lessons would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The functional equivalent of that -- a cap-and-trade system -- worked spectacularly well when Congress required marketable permits for discharging sulfur dioxide (SO2) in 1995. Acid rain caused by SO2 emissions quickly plummeted, at about one-sixth the cost predicted. Once people have to pay for their emissions, they find ingenious ways of reducing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 3: A carbon tax would destroy jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a carbon tax were scheduled to be gradually phased in once the economy recovered, its mere announcement would create jobs right away. As with any policy change, there would be winners and losers. But because an impending carbon tax would render many existing energy-using processes obsolete, it would create strong incentives for corporations to put their mountains of idle cash to work. Spending on development of more efficient processes, with attendant hiring, would be expected to begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 4: The cost of reducing CO2 emissions would be prohibitively high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because a steep tax on emissions would generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, you might assume the policy would entail big costs for ordinary people. But every dollar raised by a carbon tax is a dollar by which other taxes can be reduced. The actual cost of reducing CO2 emissions would be only those costs associated with the cleaner processes we're led to adopt, and they promise to be low. Experience in other countries, for example, suggests that a carbon tax that doubled the price of gasoline would result in cars that are more than twice as efficient as today's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost objection is further undermined by evidence that we're already bearing high costs because of our failure to limit carbon emissions, as the White House declared in a report last week. The net cost of reducing emissions would properly include an adjustment for the corresponding reduction in weather damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 5: It's pointless for Americans to reduce CO2 emissions, since unilateral action won't solve global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although an effective solution will take global coordination, America's inaction has been a major barrier to progress. If the United States and Europe each adopted a steep carbon tax, they could elicit broader cooperation through heavy tariffs on goods produced in countries that failed to do likewise. India and China need access to our markets, giving us enormous leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 6: Penalizing greenhouse gas emissions would violate people's freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they don't cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mill's cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someone's freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, the respected M.I.T. global climate simulation model estimated that if we do nothing to curb greenhouse emissions, there's a 10 percent chance that temperatures will rise by more than 12 degrees Fahrenheit by century's end, causing wholesale destruction of life as we know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's still time to eliminate this catastrophic risk at surprisingly modest cost. If we fail to act, future historians may wonder from behind high sea walls why we allowed the more effective responses we could have pursued to be blocked by an easily debunked collection of myths.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A new study finds Atlantic Ocean warming is a powerful driver of a host of recent world-spanning climate and ocean patterns. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using climate models and observations, a fascinating study in this week's issue of Nature Climate&nbsp;Change points to a marked recent warming of the Atlantic Ocean as a powerful shaper of a host of notable changes in climate and ocean patterns in the last couple of decades - including Pacific wind, sea level and ocean patterns, the decade-plus hiatus in global warming and even California's deepening drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, &quot;Recent Walker circulation strengthening andPacific cooling amplified by Atlantic warming,&quot; was undertaken by researchers at the University of New South Wales and University of Hawaii. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read on for the abstract, a related news release and a couple of cautionary reactions from seasoned climate scientists uninvolved with this new paper (keeping in mind the importance of avoiding &quot;single-study syndrome&quot;): </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unprecedented strengthening of Pacific trade winds since the late 1990s has caused widespread climate perturbations, including rapid sea-level rise in the western tropical Pacific, strengthening of Indo-Pacific ocean currents, and an increased uptake of heat in the equatorial Pacific thermocline. The corresponding intensification of the atmospheric Walker circulation is also associated with sea surface cooling in the eastern Pacific, which has been identified as one of the contributors to the current pause in global surface warming. In spite of recent progress in determining the climatic impacts of the Pacific trade wind acceleration, the cause of this pronounced trend in atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we analyze a series of climate model experiments along with observational data to show that the recent warming trend in Atlantic sea surface temperature and the corresponding trans-basin displacements of the main atmospheric pressure centers were key drivers of the observed Walker circulation intensification, eastern Pacific cooling, North American rainfall trends and western Pacific sea-level rise. Our study suggests that global surface warming has been partly offset by the Pacific climate response to enhanced Atlantic warming since the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research sent an initial reaction to the overall thesis:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that the changes going on are global in scope and the Walker circulation linking the Pacific and Atlantic plays an important role, but I have to be very very skeptical to say the Atlantic is the driver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the warming Indian Ocean is also a big factor in how ENSO develops these days.  It is clearly now a bigger player than 20 or more years ago because it has warmed more than the other oceans, which get relief from ocean dynamics (ENSO in the Pacific and the Thermohaline circulation in Atlantic act as regulators of heat build up).  The unusual thing about the current El Nino is the failure to cool off in the west Pacific and Indian Ocean as the central and eastern Pacific warmed, so the Southern Oscillation has not really switched.  i.e. the SO part of ENSO has not yet happened.  One interpretation is that the amount of warm water is so great that the normal change in winds and currents has just brought more warm water to the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So my quick reaction to this paper is why the word &quot;cause&quot;? There is no doubt that the processes they describe are involved but what sets them off is another matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Wunsch, who's currently a visiting professor of physical oceanography and climate at Harvard, wrote this note stressing the importance of putting this work in broader context with the broader flow of climate science:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a colleague said to me &quot;Just because it was published in Nature or Science doesn't mean it's wrong.&quot; Science (lowercase) requires thought, independent calculations, discussion, time, and context. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[This] proposal isn't crazy, but figuring out how these things are connected will take months and years. Causality in anything remotely as complicated as the climate system is an exceedingly difficult concept, and I would argue anyone who instantly says &quot;yes this must be right&quot; or &quot;no this is wrong&quot; or even that &quot;this is important&quot; cannot possibly know what he is talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the University of New South Wales news release: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atlantic warming turbocharges Pacific trade winds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Record breaking trade winds may have led to hiatus in global surface average temperatures<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research has found rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean, likely caused by global warming, has turbocharged Pacific Equatorial trade winds. Currently the winds are at a level never before seen on observed records, which extend back to the 1860s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in these winds has caused eastern tropical Pacific cooling, amplified the Californian drought, accelerated sea level rise three times faster than the global average in the Western Pacific and has slowed the rise of global average surface temperatures since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may even be responsible for making El Nino events less common over the past decade due to its cooling impact on ocean surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were surprised to find the main cause of the Pacific climate trends of the past 20 years had its origin in the Atlantic Ocean,&quot; said co-lead author Dr Shayne McGregor from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS) at the University of New South Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It highlights how changes in the climate in one part of the world can have extensive impacts around the globe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record-breaking increase in Pacific Equatorial trade winds over the past 20 years had, until now, baffled researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally, this trade wind intensification was considered to be a response to Pacific decadal variability. However, the strength of the winds was much more powerful than expected due to the changes in Pacific sea surface temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another riddle was that previous research indicated that under global warming scenarios Pacific Equatorial Trade winds would slow down over the coming century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution was found in the rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean basin, which has created unexpected pressure differences between the Atlantic and Pacific. This has produced wind anomalies that have given Pacific Equatorial trade winds an additional big push.<BR>&quot;The rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean created high pressure zones in the upper atmosphere over that basin and low pressure zones close to the surface of the ocean,&quot; said Prof Axel Timmermann, co-lead and corresponding author from the University of Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rising air parcels, over the Atlantic eventually sink over the eastern tropical Pacific, thus creating higher surface pressure there. The enormous pressure see-saw with high pressure in the Pacific and low pressure in the Atlantic gave the Pacific trade winds an extra kick, amplifying their strength. It's like giving a playground roundabout an extra push as it spins past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many climate models appear to have underestimated the magnitude of the coupling between the two ocean basins, which may explain why they struggled to produce the recent increase in Pacific Equatorial trade wind trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While active, the stronger Equatorial trade winds have caused far greater overturning of ocean water in the West Pacific, pushing more atmospheric heat into the ocean, as shown by co-author and ARCCSS Chief Investigator Prof Matthew England earlier this year. This increased overturning appears to explain much of the recent slowdown in the rise of global average surface temperatures.<BR>Importantly, the researchers don't expect the current pressure difference between the two ocean basins to last. When it does end, they expect to see some rapid changes, including a sudden acceleration of global average surface temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be difficult to predict when the Pacific cooling trend and its contribution to the global hiatus in surface temperatures will come to an end,&quot; Prof England said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, a large El Ni&ntilde;o event is one candidate that has the potential to drive the system back to a more synchronized Atlantic/Pacific warming situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts suggest extreme weather could be disrupting biorhythms and food supply, and fishing nets cutting off access to salmon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rash of bear attacks in Russia have left at least three people dead and many more injured in recent weeks as record high temperatures, freak snow, hailstorms and flooding hit Siberia and the country's far east.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human activity may be causing some of the attacks. Experts cited by the news agency Interfax said nets and obstacles have prevented salmon from swimming up some rivers to spawn, leaving bears hungry. Extreme weather can also disrupt the predators' biorhythms and food supply, said Vladimir Krever, director of the biodiversity programme at WWF Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent attacks include one at 2am on Wednesday at a meteorological station in the forests of Sakha Republic. A bear broke down the door of a residential trailer and bit the arm of the woman inside, only to be scared away by her loud screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days earlier another bear ambushed a boy on Iturup island as he was walking home from his grandmother's house. The bear had dragged the 14-year-old to the shore by the time police arrived and shot it dead. The boy received 170 stitches and remains in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, a bear killed three construction workers on Sakhalin island and left two in critical condition in an attack that was partially filmed on one of the men's mobile phones. During another attack in the Sakha Republic, a man's mobile phone saved his life when it suddenly activated and the tone scared off a bear that was biting his head. Adult brown bears found in Siberia and far-east Russia can grow to more the 590kg (1,300lb) in size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The increase of number of extreme natural phenomena, hurricanes, storms, sudden heat or cold, it can lead to a growth in conflict situations for people in nature, including with bears,&quot; Krever said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A heatwave this month has caused games for Russia's football championship to be delayed and a ceremonial changing of the presidential guard to be cancelled. ThisRecord-breaking temperatures were reported in the Siberian cities of Barnaul, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 July, a heatwave in the Novosibirsk region ended suddenly when the temperature dropped and the area was pelted with egg-sized hail, to the horror of beach-goers in one viral video. The same day, a rainstorm turned into a blizzard and up to 10cm of snow in the Chelyabinsk region owing to what experts said was an Arctic cyclone. Also in July, authorities declared a state of emergency after three months' worth of rain fell in 36 hours in Magadan, cutting off some residents while others wakeboarded behind cars and trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate and energy programme at WWF Russia, these phenomena are part of a trend he attributed to global climate&nbsp;change, which on top of natural variations has caused the frequency of extreme weather events to more than double in all parts of Russia over the past two decades. &quot;In Russia, all these things have happened, snow in southern Urals and heat waves in Siberia, but now they're happening more often,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Rev. Lennox Yearwood punched his fist in the air as he rhythmically boomed into the microphone: ''This is a moment for great leadership. This is a moment for our country to stand up. This is our moment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Yearwood's audience was not a church. It was the Environmental Protection Agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.P.A. on Wednesday ended two days of public hearings on its proposed regulation to cut carbon pollution from power plants, and mixed in with the coal lobbyists and business executives were conservative religious leaders reasserting their support for President Obama's environmental policies -- at a time when Republican Party orthodoxy continues to question the science of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two dozen faith leaders, including evangelicals and conservative Christians, spoke at the E.P.A. headquarters in Washington by the time the hearings ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The science is clear,'' said Lisa Sharon Harper, the senior director of mobilizing for Sojourners, an evangelical organization with a social justice focus. ''The calls of city governments -- who are trying to create sustainable environments for 25, 50 years -- that's clear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Harper was one of about 20 interfaith activists who quietly sang ''Hallelujah'' and Jewish spirituals in a prayer circle outside the environmental agency's 12th Street entrance here on Tuesday. Mr. Yearwood and three other faith leaders spoke at the hearings on Tuesday, and about 20 others did on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many of the faith leaders came from traditionally progressive congregations, like black churches, synagogues and mainstream Protestant denominations, others were more conservative Christians who reflect a growing embrace of environmentalism by parts of the religious right. This week's hearings on the new E.P.A. rule gave them an opportunity to make their argument that climate&nbsp;change hurts the world's poor through natural disasters, droughts and rising sea levels, and that it is part of their faith to protect the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have been called by God to speak out on these issues and believe it is my conviction as an evangelical Christian that we must be stewards of God's creation,'' the Rev. Richard Cizik, a former top lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals and now president of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good, said in prepared remarks on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is also holding hearings this week in Atlanta, Denver and Pittsburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago, only 34 percent of white evangelical Protestants agreed that solid evidence existed that the earth was warming because of human activity, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. An additional 31 percent said that no evidence existed proving global warming whatsoever. Recent polling shows that many evangelicals are still skeptics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For the most part, people in the climate advocacy movement are ignoring a number of various biblical texts that are more specifically relevant to the issue,'' said E. Calvin Beisner, spokesman for the Cornwall Alliance, an evangelical organization opposed to the E.P.A. rule. ''They're quoting broad general texts that everyone would agree with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent years a number of conservative religious groups have embraced global warming as a serious concern. The National Association of Evangelicals began pushing for an assertive climate&nbsp;change policy during the George W. Bush administration. The Christian Coalition, founded by Pat Robertson, unsuccessfully lobbied in 2009 and 2010 for a climate&nbsp;change bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Rather than letting our faith dictate our politics, we've gotten to the point for many of us where we're letting our politics -- typically what the Republican Party says -- dictate our faith,'' Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical Christian and a climate scientist at Texas Tech, said in a phone interview. ''Caring about God's creation and caring about God's people is entirely consistent with caring for your neighbor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, groups like the Evangelical Environmental Network have grown over the past five years, said the network's president, Mitch Hescox, by making a different argument than typical environmentalists make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is not about polar bears; it's not about future life; it's about current reality and children's health,'' Mr. Hescox, a Republican who was scheduled to speak at the E.P.A. hearing in Pittsburgh on Thursday, said in a telephone interview. ''We're not going to get anywhere if it remains a liberal issue.''</SPAN></P>

The likes of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth may have been right to support wind power as an increasingly cost-effective form of renewable energy. But its large visual imprint is a blot on many landscapes and horrifies countryside lovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The green groups mostly responded to that nimbyism by holding their noses and muttering against opponents of the monstrous turbines, branding them climate sceptics and worse. That response has been a big cause of the declining influence of environmentalists in Britain. Without nimbys, they don't amount to much. It may also have inadvertently undermined the bigger cause - fighting climate&nbsp;change. Green campaigner and television wildlife host David Bellamy turned into a climate sceptic largely because of his horror at turbines sprouting on his beloved Durham moors. He was not alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So green groups must be thankful to have a popular countryside crusade they can embrace - opposition to the nascent fracking industry, which the government kickstarted this week by announcing that most of the country is open for prospecting for shale gas. But it is not obvious that they are winning the race yet or even that they have backed the right horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners are sincere, and probably right, in their belief that the world has to end its addiction to carbon-based fossil fuels. A future stable climate depends on it. So there is a reasonable case against starting a new branch of that industry by adopting advanced drilling technologies and power blasting to release gas trapped in underground beds of shale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is another side to the argument. Natural gas may be a carbon-based fuel but burning it produces only half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal, which still generates 30% of our electricity. By replacing coal, fracked gas has brought US CO2 emissions back down to levels last seen two decades ago. If, as leading climate scientists such as the US's Jim Hansen argue, the overriding need right now is to banish coal, then gas can be a big part of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, it is also true that banning fracking would raise our emissions in the short term. Declining North Sea gas would be replaced by liquefied gas from places like Qatar. Liquefying gas for shipping across the world is horrendously energy-intensive, raising effective emissions by around a fifth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any future UN climate agreement, liquefaction emissions would be logged to Qatar rather than Britain but the atmosphere doesn't notice where it comes from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So from the climate perspective, it is not obvious who is right on fracking. Last year, I argued that we should have a public debate about the pros and cons where environmentalists who thought fracking was a good idea would not be shouted down but it hasn't happened. Now the battle begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is anxious to get going. There is a lot of gas beneath the green fields of Britain, though geologists say it is far from clear how much of it will be profitable to remove. Ministers believe fracking can deliver cheap energy from within our shores while aiding their friends in the energy industry. There may even be some rural jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite their enthusiasm, ministers are wary of stirring up the shires - and their own MPs in marginal constituencies - before the general election. That's probably why they decided to make their move this week, after the Commons broke up for the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If ministers are wary of heading into battle, environment groups should be too. Right now, they are relieved to have found a cause that combines a nimbyish desire to protect the countryside with global goals of curbing climate&nbsp;change. The days of campaigners dodging calls from frustrated local activists who want them to fight wind turbines - or high-speed trains - may be passing. At last, they can save the countryside and the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause looks popular. The government's release this week of the result of its consultation process on fracking revealed that a &quot;substantial majority&quot; of interests groups were opposed, with even statutory bodies like Natural England and Public Health England expressing fears for water supplies and wildlife habitats. But it may not turn out to be so simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If and when fracking gets under way, people will probably spot that its activities are less obvious and visually intrusive that wind turbines. Many of the scary stories about underground blasts triggering earthquakes and tap water catching fire are isolated cases from the wildcat days of the industry in under-regulated parts of the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are unlikely to be repeated in heavily regulated Britain, even if the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, is in charge of planning procedures. Given the choice between a wind turbine on the hill or a fracking well in a nearby field, many would choose the latter, whatever the climate equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental campaigners have long needed the support of nimbys to get political purchase in Britain. Friends of the Earth began spectacularly here 40 years ago with a successful campaign against plans for the world's biggest copper mine in Snowdonia National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big visceral environmental causes mostly remain local campaigns against airports, motorways, high-speed rail lines or, of course, wind turbines, rather than global issues such as climate&nbsp;change. Defending our green and pleasant land is still the biggest recruiting sergeant for most environment groups. Perhaps anti-fracking is the next great cause. But it is not yet clear whether it will be, or whether it would be a good thing if it was.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your editorial (29 July) says &quot;there are serious reasons why fracking is likely to be part of Britain's future&quot; but misses many reasons why it shouldn't be. Fracking in the UK will just add to a stock of fossil fuels we cannot afford to burn if we want to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Shale gas won't magically replace coal: the government's chief scientist has said that without a global climate deal, new fossil fuel exploitation is likely to increase the risk of climate change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's headlong rush to frack is predicated on the process being safe. But many of the UK's regulations are inadequate. Fracking is banned in France and a more precautionary approach is being taken in Germany on environmental grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fracking is not the answer to the energy problems of cost and security. The first focus of UK energy policy needs to be an aggressive push on energy efficiency. Then decarbonising electricity, through a rapid expansion of renewable power. Gas is a transition fuel through the 2020s, but shale gas is not needed for this purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists say climate change could be partly to blame for declines in eight of the main overwintering species over 10 years</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magical winter wildlife spectacle of hundreds of thousands of wading birds converging on British estuaries could be under threat as research shows big declines in some of the most familiar species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results from the Wetland Bird Survey reveals ringed plovers, oystercatchers, redshank and dunlin are among the eight most abundant species overwintering on UK estuaries to suffer significant and consistent population drops over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists believe a combination of factors are responsible, including climate change forcing the birds to areas outside the UK, and say collaborative international research is imperative. Examinations of the traditional sites, the largest of which include the Wash, Morecambe Bay and Thames Estuary, are also required to determine if there are site specific issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ringed plovers have suffered a decline of 39% in 10 yearsin over-wintering birds and those breeding in the UK. Redshank have fallen by 26% and Dunlin by 23%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curlew have fallen by 17% and oystercatchers by 15% in the 10 years to June 2012. Knot have dropped by 7% and the bar-tailed godwit by 10%. Grey plover are down by 21%, according to the data collected by thousands of volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chas Holt, of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the survey co-ordinator, said: &quot;I think we should be quite alarmed because the declines for many of these species are pretty consistent. Species like the ringed plover, redshank and dunlin, their decline has been consistent for 10 to 20 years now. And there is no obvious change happening, so in 10 years time we could be well down on numbers..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard to get a handle on exactly what is going on. When you see declines like this, it could one of two or three main reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The overall population of the species as a whole could be in decline. These birds are breeding in the Arctic then wintering much further south in a flyway that runs right from north-west Europe down into Africa. So they are wintering over a large area. So, is the whole population in decline? Are they producing more young but is the survival rate lower? Or are they just slightly shifting distribution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such consistent declines, he said, &quot;mean we certainly have to take stock and understand what is going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by Wetland International has shown winter populations of some of the species has recently shifted away from the UK to Dutch and German coasts, possibly in response to milder winters. Another possibility was fewer young waders being successfully reared in the Arctic, which is experiencing rapid warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waders produce spectacular shows during the peak period from November to January. The Wash, the largest in terms of overall numbers, holds a minimum of 350,000 birds at a time, not just waders but also ducks including widgeon and pintail, and geese such as the dark bellied brent goose. It has been estimated that around 2 million birds throughout each year use the Wash, where Norfolk meets Lincolnshire, attracted by its vast sand banks and salt marshes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Hearn, head of species monitoring at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), said: &quot;The declines in waders and other wintering waterbirds in the UK over the past decade or more, as revealed by the Wetland Bird Survey, are indicative of wider concerns about the state of our environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They demonstrate the unprecedented period of change that these waterbirds are undergoing, and highlight the need for a step change in monitoring and relevant conservation action if we are to avert continued biodiversity loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wetland Bird Survey, a partnership between the BTO, the government's advisory joint nature conservation committee and the RSPB, in association with WWT, monitors birds at more than 2,000 wetland sites from estuaries to ponds across the UK.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Failing to adequately reduce the carbon pollution that contributes to climate&nbsp;change could cost the United States economy $150 billion a year, according to an analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers released Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is part of the White House's effort to increase public support for President Obama's climate-change agenda, chiefly an Environmental Protection Agency proposal targeting coal-fired power plants, the nation's largest source of planet-warming pollution. The E.P.A. will hold public hearings on the proposal, which are expected to be heated, this week in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of power plants, a decline in domestic coal production, an increase in electricity rates and a fundamental transformation of the nation's power supply. The White House has repeatedly sought to make the case that the long-term cost of not cutting carbon emissions -- including longer droughts, worse floods and bigger wildfires that will damage homes, businesses and the nation's infrastructure -- will be higher than the short-term expense of carrying out the regulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the report was intended to explain ''why the administration is doing so many things on so many levels to deal with climate&nbsp;change.'' He added, ''Each decade we delay action results in added cost.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concludes that climate-change costs will increase 40 percent for each decade that nations do not curb carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group backed by Koch Industries, the Kansas conglomerate run by Charles G. and David H. Koch, is planning demonstrations outside the hearings to protest the regulation aimed at coal-fired power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama's E.P.A. is waging a war on traditional affordable energy through burdensome regulations and unrealistic mandates,'' the group's president, Tim Phillips, said in a statement. ''It's time for the American people to stand up to this federal overreach, and send a message that they cannot afford to pay for Obama's environmental ideology.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, a state that is heavily dependent on coal, is expected to speak at the public hearing in Washington about losses of coal-mining jobs under the proposal. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which lobbies for the coal industry, said it would show videos criticizing the plan outside each hearing site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environmental Defense Fund, which is in favor of the rule, is planning rallies that are intended to focus on the dangers of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House report adds to a growing stack of research linking climate&nbsp;change to economic costs. A report titled ''Risky Business,'' issued last month by a bipartisan coalition backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire and environmental activist, among others, also concluded that the long-term costs of carbon pollution would be greater than the expense of cutting emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional Democrats are working on their own messages. The Senate Budget Committee, led by Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, conducted a hearing on Tuesday to show the effect of climate&nbsp;change on the federal budget. Over the past decade, federal spending during droughts, floods and wildfires has reached record levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's becoming clearer and clearer that if you care about the deficit, you need to care about climate&nbsp;change,'' Ms. Murray said in a statement. ''We've got a responsibility to leave a stronger country for our children and grandchildren, and that means addressing climate&nbsp;change to help the environment, help the economy and help the federal budget.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats hope that argument will win over some fiscally conservative Republicans. Most Republicans have said that the E.P.A. climate-change rules exemplify what they call the Obama administration's overreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing last week, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told the E.P.A. administrator, Gina McCarthy: ''You don't run the country. American people run the country.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan to engineer a shorter, smaller human race to cope with climate&nbsp;change is almost as big and bold as the schemes of people working to convince themselves climate&nbsp;change won't affect them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, at this point still sketchy, has three engineers. S Matthew Liao is a professor of bioethics at New York University. Anders Sandberg and Rebecca Roache are fellows who study ethics at the University of Oxford. The trio launched their &quot;be-littler&quot; idea in a paper called &quot;Human engineering and climate&nbsp;change&quot;, in 2012 in the journal Ethics, Policy and the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This solution involves the biomedical modification of humans to make them better at mitigating climate&nbsp;change,&quot; they announced. They say this human engineering would be voluntary - &quot;possibly supported by incentives such as tax breaks or sponsored healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase &quot;human engineering&quot; has been in use for more than a century. But until now, it has meant designing or re-designing things to accommodate the way people already are. Liao, Sandberg and Roache reverse that definition. One of their proposed projects is to modify people, genetically or with drugs, so they &quot;feel nauseous&quot; if they eat meat, thus leading to a shrinkage of the meat industry (and its oh-by-the-way copious production of greenhouse gases.) Or, to make people smarter, which might induce them to produce fewer new people. Or, again, to modify people's minds, using drugs or other means, &quot;to enhance our moral decisions by making us more altruistic and empathetic,&quot; in a way that would cause us to mitigate our climate-changing activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their punchiest proposal is &quot;making humans smaller&quot;. Their reasoning is simple: &quot;Other things being equal, the larger one is, the more food and energy one requires&quot;. Bigger people also consume bigger amounts of energy indirectly, they say. Cars use more fuel to carry heavy passengers. Stout folk need more fabric to cover themselves. Weightier persons &quot;wear out shoes, carpets, and furniture more quickly, and so on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They explore whether it's best to reduce humans' average height, or weight, or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, but, but. . . who in their right mind would choose to make their children smaller? Liao, Sandberg and Roache make a point of asking that question. Their answer? History is replete with examples of ideas which, while widely supported or even invaluable now, were ridiculed and dismissed. . . Pasteur's theory of germs. . . the telephone. . . heavier than air flying machines. . . computers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan to engineer a shorter, smaller human race to cope with climate&nbsp;change is almost as big and bold as the schemes of people working to convince themselves climate&nbsp;change won't affect them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, at this point still sketchy, has three engineers. S Matthew Liao is a professor of bioethics at New York University. Anders Sandberg and Rebecca Roache are fellows who study ethics at the University of Oxford. The trio launched their &quot;be-littler&quot; idea in a paper called &quot;Human engineering and climate&nbsp;change&quot;, in 2012 in the journal Ethics, Policy and the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This solution involves the biomedical modification of humans to make them better at mitigating climate&nbsp;change,&quot; they announced. They say this human engineering would be voluntary - &quot;possibly supported by incentives such as tax breaks or sponsored healthcare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase &quot;human engineering&quot; has been in use for more than a century. But until now, it has meant designing or re-designing things to accommodate the way people already are. Liao, Sandberg and Roache reverse that definition. One of their proposed projects is to modify people, genetically or with drugs, so they &quot;feel nauseous&quot; if they eat meat, thus leading to a shrinkage of the meat industry (and its oh-by-the-way copious production of greenhouse gases.) Or, to make people smarter, which might induce them to produce fewer new people. Or, again, to modify people's minds, using drugs or other means, &quot;to enhance our moral decisions by making us more altruistic and empathetic,&quot; in a way that would cause us to mitigate our climate-changing activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their punchiest proposal is &quot;making humans smaller&quot;. Their reasoning is simple: &quot;Other things being equal, the larger one is, the more food and energy one requires&quot;. Bigger people also consume bigger amounts of energy indirectly, they say. Cars use more fuel to carry heavy passengers. Stout folk need more fabric to cover themselves. Weightier persons &quot;wear out shoes, carpets, and furniture more quickly, and so on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They explore whether it's best to reduce humans' average height, or weight, or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, but, but. . . who in their right mind would choose to make their children smaller? Liao, Sandberg and Roache make a point of asking that question. Their answer? History is replete with examples of ideas which, while widely supported or even invaluable now, were ridiculed and dismissed. . . Pasteur's theory of germs. . . the telephone. . . heavier than air flying machines. . . computers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has approved a A$16.5bn (&pound;9bn) project that will lead to the creation of the largest coalmine in Australia, despite protests from environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge Carmichael mine and rail project, overseen by the Indian mining company Adani, will consist of a network of opencast and underground mines in the Galilee Basin region of central Queensland. About 60m tonnes of coal a year will be mined for export. It will be carried on a new rail line to the port of Abbot Point, where Adani has approval to build a coal export terminal. Five million tonnes of seabed will be dug up and dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park to expand Abbot Point for the trade, primarily to India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carmichael mine, which was given the green light by the Queensland government in May, has been fiercely opposed by environmentalists because of its potential impact on the reef and the groundwater at its site and its hefty carbon emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace said the environment minister, Greg Hunt, had &quot;laid out the red carpet for a coal company with a shocking track record to dig up the outback, dump on the Great Barrier Reef and fuel climate&nbsp;change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adani has been fined in India for violating environmental conditions relating to a port development in Gujarat. An Indian government review found Adani's failure to monitor groundwater for pollution was a &quot;clear violation&quot; of the conditions. The company was also criticised for its destruction of mangroves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt, who announced the deal yesterday, has imposed 36 conditions on the project, primarily aimed at protecting groundwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Greenpeace says coal from the mine will cause an additional 128m tonnes of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. By contrast, the Australian government's proposed Direct Action climate scheme, which targets only domestic emissions, aims to reduce emissions by 131m tonnes each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adani estimates the mine itself will produce about 3bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over its 60-year lifespan. This is due to &quot;fugitive&quot; emissions released during the mining process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carmichael approval is a major step in the opening of the vast, coal-rich Galilee Basin region. In total nine mining projects are planned for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt said the conditions imposed would ensure Adani &quot;meets the highest environmental standards and that all impacts, including cumulative impacts, are avoided, mitigated or offset&quot;. He said: &quot;The absolute strictest of conditions have been imposed to ensure the protection of the environment, with a specific focus on the protection of groundwater.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt said the project would have a value of $5bn a year over the next 60 years, adding $2.97bn a year to the Queensland economy over the period. It is estimated the mine will also create 2,475 construction jobs and a further 3,920 jobs once it is operational in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adani will be required to ensure at least 730m litres of water are returned to the environment every year for five years. It will also have to monitor the condition of groundwater, offset the impact of cleared habitats and assess the impact on threatened species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Felicity Wishart, a campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the mine's approval was bad news for the Great Barrier Reef. She said: &quot;At full capacity there will be a further 480 ships crossing the reef, in an area home to humpback whales, sea turtles and dugongs. And then there's the impact of the dredging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Great Barrier Reef is particularly vulnerable to climate&nbsp;change so we need to be doing everything we can to reduce that pressure on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Larissa Waters said: &quot;History will look back on the government's decision today as an act of climate criminality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gautam Adani, the chairman of Adani, said: &quot;Development of the Galilee Basin is vital for the regional and economic growth of both Queensland and Australia, and Adani's projects play an important role in realising this growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace says coal from the Carmichael mine would release an extra 128m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we pour heat-trapping gases into the air, we're running an experiment. We're going to see what a rapidly changing climate does to the world's biodiversity -- how many species shift to new ranges, how many adapt to their new environment and how many become extinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't have a very good idea of how the experiment will turn out. Scientists are coming to appreciate that there's a lot about how climate affects life that they still don't understand. That's true, it turns out, even for species that scientists have been studying carefully for years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early 2000s, Ary A. Hoffmann, a biologist then at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, wondered how the many species in tropical rain forests would cope when their humid environment dried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was conceivable that some species might adapt. Over the generations, natural selection ought to favor the individuals that could survive longer in dry air. Over time, the whole population should become more resistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To see if tropical species really did have this evolutionary potential, Dr. Hoffmann ran an experiment with tropical flies native to Australian rain forests called Drosophila birchii. He and his colleagues took the flies out of their damp jungle home and put them in vials where the relative humidity was a bone-dry 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the flies were dying off. But Dr. Hoffmann rescued those that survived longest and let them breed. He repeated this procedure over 50 generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the end of the experiment, the flies were no more resistant to dry air than their forebears. The flies seemed to lack the genetic potential to evolve. Those results suggested that if the rain forest home of Drosophilia birchii loses its high humidity, the flies will die off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dr. Hoffmann and his colleagues ran similar tests on other species of flies, they had equally grim results. Flies that had limited ranges in the tropics showed little potential to adapt to extremely dry conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, two of Dr. Hoffmann's collaborators -- Belinda van Heerwaarden and Carla M. Sgr&ograve; of Monash University -- decided to rerun the experiment, but with a crucial twist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than expose the flies to 10 percent relative humidity, Dr. van Heerwaarden and Dr. Sgr&ograve; tried 35 percent. That's still far drier than the moist air of rain forests, but it's not the aridity one might encounter on a summer day in Death Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a humidity that's more relevant to the predictions for how dry the environment would become in the next 30 to 50 years,'' Dr. Sgr&ograve; said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even at 35 percent humidity, Dr. van Heerwaarden and Dr. Sgr&ograve; found, the flies fared badly. On average, they died after just 12 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr. van Heerwaarden and Dr. Sgr&ograve; found that some of the flies survived a little longer than others. By comparing different families of flies, they discovered that the difference in the flies' resistance was influenced by their genes. That's not what the first experiment had suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our first thought was, 'Oh my God, what's happening here?''' Dr. Sgr&ograve; said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and Dr. van Heerwaarden wondered if these genes might provide a chance for the flies to adapt to a drier climate after all. To find out, they rescued the longest-living flies and let them breed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the flies in the earlier studies, it didn't take long for these to start evolving. After just five generations, one species was able to survive 23 percent longer in 35 humidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When you change the environment, you get a totally different answer,'' Dr. van Heerwaarden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, hints that the flies resist drying out in an unexpected way. The genes that help them temporarily survive extreme dryness are not the same as those that help them resist more moderate conditions. The second set of genes enables them to adapt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas the earlier research offered a bleak prospect for species' adaptation to climate&nbsp;change, the new study may offer a bit more hope. ''This result suggests that some species might have the capacity to persist for a little bit longer,'' Dr. Sgr&ograve; said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is good to see that there might be some adaptive potential,'' said Dr. Hoffmann, who was not involved in the new study. ''Anything is useful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he questioned just how much help their evolution might be. While the flies might be able to start adapting to drier conditions, they may not be able to do it quickly enough to keep pace with the change. ''I think the warning in the original work still stands,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some other scientists have documented the capacity for species to evolve in response to climate&nbsp;change, said Andrew Hendry, an evolutionary biologist at McGill University. But it's rare for scientists to examine species under a range of conditions, as Dr. van Heerwaarden and Dr. Sgr&ograve; have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hendry said the new study adds to growing evidence that many species will find ways to evolve in response to climate&nbsp;change, if only a little. ''Evolution will help, there's no question,'' Dr. Hendry said. ''But it might not help enough.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you wanted to radically alter the economy, making a country such as Britain as dynamic as China or Brazil, what would the state have to do? Intervene, obviously, but how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has become a hard question to answer since the onset of free-market economics. Much of the old apparatus of state control has been dismantled. Plus, the political culture in which planners, engineers and technical innovators inhabited the same offices has been shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a modern-day civil servant wanted to place the proposal to build, say, Concorde on a minister's desk, there wouldn't even be an obvious ministry to go to. It was the UK's Ministry of Supply that set up the supersonic airliner project: it commissioned a prototype aircraft, immediately, at its first meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When state innovation projects worked, they did so because their owners were politicians, who were allowed to think big and who accepted the risk of failure. In the freemarket model, the private sector is given the task of driving innovation. But though the individual results look spectacular - from info-tech, genetics and materials science to neuro-medicine - we have not experienced the same &quot;lift-off&quot; as in previous industrial revolutions, where all the innovations synergise, producing high-dynamism and rising wealth for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, in the developed world, amid rapid tech innovation, we sway between low growth and stagnation. And a growing number of economists believe it will remain so unless we rethink the role of the state. The Sussex University professor Mariana Mazzucato, whose calls for an &quot;entrepreneurial state&quot; were greeted with incomprehension four years ago, recently put together a conference attended by ministers, central bankers and serious investors. The buzzwords were: think big, and do &quot;mission-oriented finance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazzucato points out the state played a role in financing nearly every key technology in an iPhone, from GPS to the touch screen. She says that, even now, the lion's share of funding for climate&nbsp;change technologies comes from state investment banks and public utilities, with just 6% coming from private capital. The problem is, the modern state sees this as accidental and residual. It avoids major projects, and their associated risks, seeing its role as mainly to act where the market &quot;fails&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazzucato, in a paper with LSE professor Carlota Perez, points out the danger of leaving tech to the private sector. In an economy bloated with printed money and cheap credit, if capital can't find real-world, high-growth, high-profit opportunities to invest in, it will pool into the finance system, creating one bubble after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seen from this angle, the financial crisis looks less like the product of bad practices in the City, and more like a structural crisis. At all previous takeoff points, capital in the finance system flowed out into the real economy, where a paradigm had been established making it easy for businesspeople to invest in tried-and-tested models, with predictable and growing demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solving this problem is not just critical for economics. The clearest unmet need on Earth is for technologies to combat climate&nbsp;change. It's impossible for markets to direct climate science, or climate technology, because there is no ready-made framework that will make the innovations being tried profitable. It should be a no-brainer that the modern-day equivalent of Concorde or the Apollo projects - classic &quot;mission-oriented&quot; state projects - should be green technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History shows innovation happens best when the state shapes it. During the second world war, the US decreed that companies could only profit from making and selling their military technologies - any attempt to derive profit from monopolised intellectual property stood against the public good. Once they knew the American state was trying to achieve an anti-aircraft fire control system first, and a number-crunching static computer later, the greatest innovators alive set to work on making a gun predict the ideas in a fighter pilot's head. Mainframes - and other technologies - followed, and reaped high profits for the corporations that pioneered them. But it was the state that forced the take-off point to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thinking big about the economic role of the state no longer means planned allocation of goods, or state provision: it means the state setting pathways for technology and rewarding those who follow them. That means that politicians and civil servants will have to do more than overcome their opposition to picking winners. It means changing the tax system to reward long-term investments in real activities, forcing the finance system to lend to value-creating businesses - and limiting the ability of corporates to use accumulated cash simply to buy their own shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every takeoff point in history has seen the state reorganise the market and promote prosperity. The boom-bust cycles of the past 15 years show we're at a turning point, but in large parts of the developed world we have states that don't think they should exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the proponents of modern laissez-faire economics could point to a single economy where technology and markets had worked, alone, to create a confident, high-growth economic model, their arguments would be stronger. But it's China, Singapore, South Korea and Brazil where the success stories happened. The state was at the centre of every one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting the environment starts at people's front doors, not in climate treaties, argues a new report. Will thinking locally lead to greater support for global climate change aims?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is easily the most confounding 'collective action' problem we have ever faced. We must act - collectively - in the best interests of not only today's global population, but also the presumed interests of people yet to be born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows that nurturing a sense of shared identity - what is sometimes called social capital, or the elusive but ubiquitous concept of community - should make people more receptive to appeals for collective global action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new report from the Fabian Society takes this argument one step further. According to the report's authors, Natan Doron and Ed Wallis, people instinctively think of the environment not in terms of carbon emissions and climate&nbsp;change, but in terms of the place where they live and the people who live there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most people, protecting the environment starts at their front door, not with an internationally binding global agreement on dangerous climate&nbsp;change. Anti-social behaviour is the biggest concern, with climate&nbsp;change ranking alongside dog-fouling and littering. People feel that citizenship has declined, and that opportunities for working together are limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report argues that if people feel they are able to participate in and improve their local environment, they are more likely to support the global aims of environmental campaigns. If they think they can change things in their own back yard, they are more likely to think they can change the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their findings echo other research which suggests that people's sense of &quot;place attachment&quot; (which is as much about the local community and social cohesion as it is about physical geography) is a key influence on their views about climate&nbsp;change and other environmental issues. It has also long been recognised that reducing the psychological distance between people and climate&nbsp;change is an important challenge. So long as climate&nbsp;change remains a remote and abstract issue, it is easy to close our eyes and wish it away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doron and Wallis make some bold recommendations for overhauling the way in which climate&nbsp;change campaigners operate. They suggest that the quickest way to get support for ambitious action on climate&nbsp;change globally is for campaigners to switch a proportion of their budgets away from lobbying international negotiations and towards supporting community organising to improve local environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To build a popular environmentalism, they argue, global issues such as climate&nbsp;change must be brought back to the doorsteps of ordinary people, where tangible, local action on the environment can be seen to be working. They even propose a new bank holiday, to be held in the middle of the working week, which would focus national attention on community action and &quot;provide a focal point for campaigners to highlight local environmental projects on a large scale and generate widespread media attention, as well as an opportunity to reach out beyond the 'usual suspects'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic logic of the recommendations - that climate&nbsp;change begins at home - is reflected in the newly launched For the Love Of campaign (which my colleagues and I at COIN worked on). Our research found that people from a range of different backgrounds (including conservatives and trade union members) responded positively to a narrative about climate&nbsp;change that focused on standing up for the &quot;things people love&quot; that are threatened by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video for the campaign shows a diverse range of people and the issues they are passionate about, from football, to gardening, to summertime. Flooded football pitches, disrupted growing seasons and increased summer rainstorms provide a direct link between climate&nbsp;change and people's passion. It's a powerful demonstration of the principle that global change has local effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly there are potential hazards in the &quot;go local&quot; approach. For a start, there is a risk of trivialising world-wide problems like climate&nbsp;change by homing in on individuals' everyday concerns. Wouldn't it be better to get people thinking about the big issues - the poverty and malnourishment that climate&nbsp;change will bring - rather than the minutiae of the issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, for better or for worse, these issues are not top of mind for most of us, most of the time. This doesn't mean that people are oblivious to them, but that a conversation about climate&nbsp;change must build a bridge between concerns about the local environment (or the everyday things that people love) and the global dimensions of environmental change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson from the Fabian Society report is that building community cohesion, nurturing a sense of collective action around local environmental issues, and supporting micro rather than macro concerns can be a portal through which a more global sense of citizenship can be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups such as the Transition Towns network have been saying this for quite a long time, but have not yet been able to break into the mainstream. Perhaps a new bank holiday to celebrate the virtues of linking local community action to global campaigns would do the trick: confronting climate&nbsp;change, 'for the love of' a day off...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Continuing rise in U.S. exports of coal work against domestic reductions in CO2 emissions. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comprehensive and sobering Associated Press story by Dina Cappiello provides a valuable update on how United States policies promoting exports of coal are undercutting domestic efforts to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas released when fossil fuels are burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is hardly a surprise given past reporting on this issue, and a long history of such seemingly conflicting policies. Earlier this year, I wrote about how today's coal exports echo the boom in tobacco exports after the United States cracked down on that industry and smoking in the Clinton years. As I wrote, &quot;[I]f we can't get it right with tobacco, where there's no benefit to weigh against the toll in lives and costs, how can we get it right with fossil fuels, where the real-time benefits of affordable energy seem always to trump the long-term risks from climate&nbsp;change?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider that question as you read the A.P. piece, which is datelined Newport News, Va., and begins this way: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal from Appalachia rumbles into this port city, 150 railroad cars at a time, bound for the belly of the massive cargo ship Prime Lily. The ship soon sets sail for South America, its 80,000 tons of coal destined for power plants and factories, an export of American energy - and pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., this coal and the carbon dioxide it will eventually release into the atmosphere are some of the unwanted leftovers of an America going greener. With the country moving to cleaner natural gas, the Obama administration wants to reduce power plant pollution to make good on its promise to the world to cut emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the estimated 228,800 tons of carbon dioxide contained in the coal aboard the Prime Lily equals the annual emissions of a small American power plant. It's leaving this nation's shores, but not the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the piece, Rick Duke, President Obama's deputy climate adviser, defends the seemingly counterproductive policy this way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that coal supply is widely available from many sources, our time is better spent working on leading toward a global commitment to cut carbon pollution on the demand side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Insert, 11:35 a.m. | The article cites an analysis earlier this year by&nbsp;Shakeb Afsah&nbsp;and Kendyl Salcito of CO2 Scorecard concluding that emissions&nbsp;from coal exports have wiped out all the carbon dioxide emissions reductions achieved in the United States in switching from coal to natural gas.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please read the entire story here. There's much more, including on-the-ground reporting from the 750-megawatt Trianel power plant in Luenena, Germany, which only burns imported coal (Germany is closing down its coal mines).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are echoes here of the World Bank's struggles to evolve its policies on coal plants with global warming in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this reflects the reality that coal will be part of the world's energy mix for another generation or more. Europe is even considering incentives for boosting its exports of coal-plant technology, as the website EurActive recently reported:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European makers of coal-fired power plants could get financial help to export the equipment, according to a Commission policy paper, flying in the face of environmental opposition to any form of subsidy for coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel, emitting around twice as much carbon dioxide as gas when used to generate power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the European Union is phasing out subsidies for domestic coal plants by 2018 in line with its efforts to take a global lead in the fight against climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the century, Austin's average summertime high temperature could be six degrees above today's average high of 97 degrees. And it may be hotter than 110 degrees in the city more than 20 days a year; even one day that hot is a rarity now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are among the findings of a study that the city commissioned last year on the impact of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you're going to build a substation that's going to cost tens of millions of dollars but it's not going to operate over 110 degrees, it's really important to be thinking about that now,'' said Zach Baumer, the city's climate program manager. While other Texas cities have looked at climate&nbsp;change issues, none have done comprehensive studies of their impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, which Mr. Baumer said cost less than $20,000, was the start of Austin's efforts to apply global climate projections specifically to the city. Reports from groups like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change focus on global temperature and rainfall models, which for Austin are ''just not useful to actually make decisions,'' Mr. Baumer said. With forecasts specifically related to Austin, ''we can start to put plans in place and act in ways that make sense, and not just sort of generalize, 'Oh, we're doing something about it,' '' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, which was done by the scientific research and consulting firm Atmos, also found that while Austin would probably experience longer dry spells and receive less rain over all, it would be hit more frequently with ''extreme precipitation'' events that could lead to widespread flooding. City departments recently asked the City Council for more than $650,000 for detailed assessments of how climate&nbsp;change could affect Austin's infrastructure, from its water reservoirs and power plants to its parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond Austin's efforts, regional planning organizations in the Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth areas are among several across the country using federal highway funds to study the effects of global warming on critical road infrastructure. Mr. Baumer said the impact on roads was among the easiest to study in the context of climate&nbsp;change, because engineers already know what temperatures and conditions the roads can withstand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, without broader cooperation from the state, it is unclear how far individual cities can go. State water officials do not consider climate&nbsp;change when planning for Texas' future, and legislators will not ask them to anytime soon, said State Senator Troy Fraser, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's not a parameter that we've requested they look at,'' Mr. Fraser said in June. ''There's a disagreement within the people of Texas on the science of greenhouse gases.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operators of the electric grid that serves Austin and most of Texas have not done comprehensive studies on the effects of climate&nbsp;change on power plants or substations, although they have noted that the record-breaking summer in recent years has caused power plants in Texas to stop operating or reduce their loads. Robbie Searcy, a spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said its projections of energy demand rely on temperature data from the last 12 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A projection for higher temperatures in the future would not be in the models at this time,'' Ms. Searcy said. ''If we see trends change, we can tweak the models in the future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Austin's City Council plans to go ahead with its own assessments of climate&nbsp;change, as well as adopting goals to better keep track of greenhouse gas emissions and reduce them accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think there is real value to setting an example and demonstrating what a city can achieve,'' said Chris Riley, a councilman who has pushed for climate&nbsp;change studies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1037 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The way the characters respond to the disappearance of 2 percent of humanity has some parallels with the way some see global warming. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new HBO series &quot;The Leftovers&quot; is about what happens after 2 percent of humanity simply vanishes from the earth (this is not really a spoiler; however, some follow). This event has obvious religious connotations, which the show explores. But the story may have secular implications, too: The way the characters reckon with their new, bizarre circumstances has something in common with how some are responding to the threat of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the show's first four episodes, the survivors deal in various ways with the aftermath of Oct. 14, the day of the disappearance. Some of them drink; some shoot dogs; some almost light a plastic Baby Jesus on fire. And some choose to stand in silent protest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the Guilty Remnant: They wear all white, refrain from speaking, smoke a lot and generally appear to oppose everything considered important about life on earth before 2 percent of humanity vanished from it. At an event to honor those who disappeared, they hold up signs spelling out &quot;Stop wasting your breath.&quot; In last week's episode, one of them proclaimed (on a pad of paper, of course), &quot;There is no family.&quot; Then some of her fellow Remnant-ers broke into people's houses and removed all their family photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers of the show don't know everything about the Remnant yet (readers of the 2011 Tom Perrotta&nbsp;novel&nbsp;that the show is based on may know more, but in the fine tradition of one strand of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; exegesis, I'm going to remain book-agnostic here), but their message for the rest of humanity seems to be: What you thought was meaningful before Oct. 14 is in fact meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nobody quite like the Guilty Remnant around today (perhaps luckily - as Dustin Rowles points out at Pajiba, they have a tendency to &quot;smoke in creepy places, like in front of people's houses,&quot; and even when they're not outright stealing, their activities seem to border on harassment). But they do share a certain ethos with those who believe we're already on an irreversible course to climate apocalypse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Smith profiled one such group, the Dark Mountain Project, in The New York Times Magazine in April (as I've mentioned in this space before). Of one of its founders, Paul Kingsnorth, wrote: &quot;The 'human machine,' as he sometimes puts it, has grown to such a size that breakdown is inevitable. What, then, do we do?&quot; Here's one thing they do:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the clearing, above a pyre, someone had erected a tall wicker sculpture in the shape of a tree, with dense gnarls and hanging hoops. Four men in masks knelt at the sculpture's base, at cardinal compass points. When midnight struck, a fifth man, his head shaved smooth and wearing a kimono, began to walk slowly around them. As he passed the masked figures, each ignited a yellow flare, until finally, his circuit complete, the bald man set the sculpture on fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guilty Remnant have not, as yet, burned any wicker trees. What's similar is their effort to answer the question &quot;What, then, do we do?&quot; What rituals matter now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the answer is clearly &quot;not the old ones.&quot; And by refusing to participate in the human activities that once made sense - family life, talking, wearing clothes that aren't white - they may have something in common with Mr. Kingsnorth, too. In a manifesto called &quot;Uncivilization,&quot; he and his co-author Dougald Hine predict that climate&nbsp;change will force a radical re-ordering of our priorities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change, which threatens to render all human projects irrelevant; which presents us with detailed evidence of our lack of understanding of the world we inhabit while, at the same time, demonstrating that we are still entirely reliant upon it. Climate&nbsp;change, which highlights in painful colour the head-on crash between civilisation and 'nature'; which makes plain, more effectively than any carefully constructed argument or optimistically defiant protest, how the machine's need for permanent growth will require us to destroy ourselves in its name. Climate&nbsp;change, which brings home at last our ultimate powerlessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reject the idea that environmentalism can preserve human society more or less the way it is now and instead call for a new tradition of art and writing that confronts the end of life as we know it and imagines what comes after:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried ruling the world; we tried acting as God's steward, then we tried ushering in the human revolution, the age of reason and isolation. We failed in all of it, and our failure destroyed more than we were even aware of. The time for civilisation is past. Uncivilisation, which knows its flaws because it has participated in them; which sees unflinchingly and bites down hard as it records - this is the project we must embark on now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specifics are obviously quite different from those of the show, but in a way all the characters on &quot;The Leftovers&quot; are engaged in projects like this. The Remnant are perhaps the most obvious, but there's also Matt Jamison, a pastor who spends his days exposing the sins of the disappeared. There's Tom Garvey, who has apprenticed himself to a sort of faith healer named Wayne. There's Nora Durst, whose husband and children all vanished and who now conducts hyperdetailed interviews with those who lost loved ones on Oct. 14. Everybody's just trying to figure out how to exist after, if not the end of the world, then the end of everything they thought they understood about it. As Willa Paskin at Slate&nbsp;puts it, &quot;Life's meaning, life's possibility, life's very continuation are all newly fraught and fragile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uncivilization&quot; calls on artists and writers to help make sense of the coming changes: &quot;We believe that art must look over the edge, face the world that is coming with a steady eye, and rise to the challenge of ecocide with a challenge of its own: an artistic response to the crumbling of the empires of the mind.&quot; It's hard to say whether &quot;The Leftovers&quot; would meet with the authors' approval - first, they focus primarily on writing, and second, the show offers a vision of humankind that, while wounded, remains in most ways civilized (the hero, such as he is, is a small-town police chief). But it does provide a kind of template for experiencing the end of an era of humanity and moving, in a strange way, on.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- Under pressure to reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government is considering a mandatory cap on coal use, the main source of carbon pollution from fossil fuels. But it would be an adjustable ceiling that would allow coal consumption to grow for years, and policy makers are at odds on how long the nation's emissions will rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials are debating these issues as they formulate a new five-year development plan, to be finalized by the end of next year. China emits more carbon dioxide than any other country, so what President Xi Jinping and his colleagues decide will have far-reaching consequences for efforts to contain climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's leaders have not detailed their views on coal or carbon emission limits. But there is robust support among senior policy advisers for a firm national cap on coal starting in 2016, Wang Yi, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing who studies environmental policy, said in a telephone interview.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think there's a broad consensus on this, and it's a question of how to implement it,'' said Professor Wang, who is a senior member of China's legislature, the National People's Congress. ''If we can have a cap on coal, that would almost be equivalent to a cap on carbon, because coal is such a dominant source of pollution and emissions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Wang and others say a coal ceiling would be easier to enforce than a cap on carbon emissions from all fossil fuels, which some experts have proposed. China accounts for half of global coal consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coal cap would be stricter than current limits, which are not mandatory and are only loosely enforced. But it would be pegged to expected economic growth and energy demand, so coal use could keep rising for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese policy advisers remain divided about how quickly the country should move to cut coal consumption. Some officials fear stricter limits would drag down the economy. They cite the prospect of mine closings, job losses and energy shortfalls if alternative sources of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric and solar power, fail to deliver in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The main difficulty is the time it takes to develop the substitutes for coal, and the uncertainties of bringing them online,'' said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University in eastern China. ''The government is now more focused on cleaning up smog, but if the economy falters, then it's possible the government's focus could shift back to economic growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strict limits are also likely to face opposition from the powerful coal industry and allied officials, said Ailun Yang, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute in Washington who works on emissions and energy policy in China. Growth in coal use has slowed markedly in the past couple of years, but the China National Coal Association said last year that it expected the country to consume 4.8 billion metric tons annually by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The real debate is about how to engage the big state-owned fossil-fuel companies, and also the big provinces whose economies are very, very dependent on these industries,'' Ms. Yang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side, some economists argue that bold efforts to reduce coal consumption would be an economic and environmental boon in the long term by encouraging new, clean modes of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, experts say, there is new pressure on the government from rising domestic anger over smog. Coal burned in power plants, boilers and furnaces is a main source of the grimy pollution that swamps Beijing and other cities, and many steps to cut smog would also cut carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The whole air pollution situation has changed the debate dramatically,'' Ms. Yang said. ''There's a lot more political space to argue for control measures.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen provinces and major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already set firm limits on coal use or goals to reduce consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the most worrisome new threat to China's carbon-cutting efforts could come from coal gasification plants, which officials have promoted as a way to reduce particulate air pollution, said Barbara A. Finamore, the Asia director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those plants can feed gas to big cities, cutting coal demand in those cities, but producing the gas emits large quantities of carbon dioxide. A report issued by Greenpeace East Asia this week said local governments in China had proposed 48 such plants, in addition to two already running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Without a national cap, there is a real danger that coal production and air pollution will simply move to other parts of China,'' Ms. Finamore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's National Energy Administration called this year for research proposals for ''caps for total energy and coal consumption for 2020, and a practical path for implementing caps on energy and coal consumption.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent study that Professor Wang oversaw at the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed that China aim for coal consumption to peak in 2025 around 4.5 billion metric tons. But other Chinese and foreign researchers say an earlier peak at a lower level is feasible and necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Han Wenke, director general of the state Energy Research Institute in Beijing, has urged China to start cutting coal consumption around 2020. China's ''actual consumption of coal is already very close to four billion tons, which is at the limits of endurance for the domestic environment,'' he wrote in a recent paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parallel debate is whether China should set a date for a peak in its carbon emissions, and if so, what that date should be. Other governments have pressed China to set a date so they can better map out how global greenhouse gas levels could rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the Chinese government has resisted doing so, partly out of fear that a deadline could become hostage to onerous international demands. But China's chief climate talks negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, said this month that the government could ''propose a peak year for carbon emissions'' in the first half of 2015, reported Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments negotiating a new climate&nbsp;change treaty have agreed to propose national contributions to emissions reduction as part of efforts to reach an agreement in Paris next year. Previous efforts have foundered in part because China and other large developing countries have refused to accept calls from rich nations to take on binding emission targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China has been the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels since around 2006, when it passed the United States, and most research indicates that its emissions are likely to keep rising for at least another decade, driven by industrialization, rising affluence and the growth of cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how long they will rise is a question that divides experts, even those close to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is major controversy,'' Pan Jiahua, an expert on global warming and greenhouse gas policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said in a telephone interview. ''I'm personally more optimistic and believe that 2025 is a viable time for a carbon emissions peak, but others think that's unrealistic and say we have to wait until 2030 or later.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At international talks in Copenhagen in 2009, governments agreed to try to hold greenhouse gas concentrations below levels likely to cause the average global temperature to rise 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the preindustrial average during this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually no country is acting fast enough to be on track to reach that target. Even if advanced countries do far more to cut carbon emissions, China's must peak by the mid-2020s to keep hope alive for the Copenhagen goal, said Niklas H&ouml;hne, director of energy and climate policy at Ecofys, a consulting company. He and others said China could do that by around 2025, given the right industry, taxation and consumption policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If a coal cap can help us reach a peak in coal in 2020, we can be confident that the CO2 peak will be about 2025,'' said Yang Fuqiang, a former energy researcher for the Chinese government and now a senior adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Beijing, referring to carbon dioxide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several experts at Chinese government institutes said it would be too economically perilous to peak so soon, and two recent Chinese studies have said that any attempt to do so before 2030 would be impractical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you wanted a peak right now, China could do it by stopping economic growth,'' said Professor Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ''But the price would be that the ordinary people would go out onto the streets.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYDNEY, Australia -- It will be remembered as one of the most ignoble moments in our history: On July 17, Australia became the first country to repeal a carbon tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy leader of the Greens Party, Adam Bandt, said it was ''the Australian Parliament's asbestos moment, our tobacco moment -- when we knew what we were doing was harmful, but went ahead and did it anyway.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax, or carbon-pricing mechanism, had defined three elections, destabilized three prime ministers and dominated public debate in this country for eight toxic years. Finally, the leader of the center-right Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, won the last election in part by promising to ''ax the tax.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott is famous for his fitness and muscular approach. As a student at Oxford, he won a ''blue'' at boxing for the university and was known for his all-out, flailing attacks. When the carbon-pricing scheme became law in 2011, he vowed to lead a ''people's revolt'' and ''fight this tax every second of every minute of every day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His political success was not, in fact, a result of the failure of the policy. The scheme was, in at least the most important sense, working, since emissions were declining. The initial public opposition was fading, but the Labor government that introduced the policy failed to sell it. Critics portrayed it as a burden that would hurt businesses and cost households, instead of one that would cut pollution and ensure a more secure future for our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the misleading old clich&eacute; -- the economy versus the environment -- but politicians staked their careers on it, and won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, the Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, said she would look at carbon-pricing proposals, but also promised, ''There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.'' Then, under pressure to form a minority government, she made a deal with the Greens and agreed to legislate a carbon price: a tax by any other name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heat, anger and vitriol directed at her as a leader -- and as Australia's first woman to be prime minister -- coalesced around the promise and the tax. It grew strangely nasty: She was branded by a right-wing shockjock as ''Ju-Liar,'' a moniker she struggled to shake. The political cynicism surrounding the carbon tax certainly reduced Ms. Gillard's political capital, but it was a perceived lack of conviction in the policy itself that damaged the pricing scheme's credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business leaders opposed what Mr. Abbott called a ''useless, destructive tax,'' even though just 0.02 percent of Australia's three million businesses were affected (the top 500 polluters). But Australia is one of the world's biggest producers of coal, and the industry is worth about $60 billion and supports an estimated 200,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A powerful triumvirate campaigned against the law: mining companies, the conservative coalition parties and Rupert Murdoch's newspapers. A study found that 82 percent of articles on the carbon tax in News Corporation's Australian papers were negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Gillard now believes she made a crucial error in framing. After losing office in June 2013, she wrote: ''I erred by not contesting the label 'tax' for the fixed price period of the emissions trading scheme I introduced. I feared the media would end up playing constant silly word games with me, trying to get me to say the word 'tax.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed that ''was a disaster.'' It wasn't just the T-word; even the term ''carbon price'' was a problem, too abstract and technical: ''It does not evoke in the minds of the public the real human horrors and economic costs of climate disasters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I made the wrong choice,'' Ms. Gillard conceded, ''and, politically, it hurt me terribly.'' With Labor plummeting in the polls, her leadership was challenged and she lost the vote to the party's previous leader, Kevin Rudd. (Mr. Rudd's victory was shortlived; less than three months later, he was defeated general election by Mr. Abbott.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition to the carbon tax trailed away after Ms. Gillard's ouster, and public concern about climate&nbsp;change has only grown. A recent poll found that almost two-thirds of Australians believe there should be carbon pricing for major emitters, but 42 percent agreed with the repeal of the tax (against 36 percent who did not). We did, after all, elect a government that promised to ax it. So we're a hot mess of contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott's claim that households will be better off by 550 Australian dollars, or $520, a year following the repeal has been greeted with skepticism. Electricity prices did go up after carbon pricing came in, but this was mostly because of investment in infrastructure. Consumers are likely to see no effect now -- unless they're paying less simply by using less electricity. An Australian National University study reported that carbon emissions from the power generation sector had been cut by 1 to 2 percent as a result of the tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If carbon pricing was working, you might well ask why the law was repealed. The result is that Australia has no clear climate policy, though Mr. Abbott says he now believes climate&nbsp;change is occurring and he takes it ''very seriously.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister's paramount concern, though, is still that taxing emissions should not ''clobber the economy.'' His government has proposed an alternative to the carbon tax, the Direct Action Scheme, that would provide incentives for businesses to cut emissions. But it faces fierce criticism -- even from within Mr. Abbott's own administration -- because of loopholes, a lack of consequences for nonparticipants and its unfunded targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's clear is that Australia has proved again that politicians rarely choose to take the lead on tackling climate&nbsp;change. When the public is conflicted, our leaders too often whip up fear, and reason and evidence go out the window. The shame is that when the tax was axed, so were the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a Skype chat Wednesday about Siberian permafrost in the context of climate&nbsp;change with Marina Leibman, a top Russian permafrost expert who had just returned from examining the unusual crater spotted on the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia late last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We talked just before fresh reports circulated about reindeer herders finding another such hole in the region. I hope you'll watch our chat, which I regret I have not yet had time to transcribe (if you are in the mood, I'd be grateful for help; it's just 15 minutes long): <BR>[Video: A Top Russian Permafrost Scientist on Siberian Holes and Climate&nbsp;Change Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leibman, the chief scientist at the Earth Cryosphere Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has studied permafrost since 1973 and has a remarkable publication record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She describes how the first hole (and presumably the new one) appear to have formed as methane is released from a warming mix of ice, water and soil, building up pressure that explosively pushed out the top of the hole, heaving chunks of earth many yards in some directions. She said there were no signs of combustion, that the hole had to be at least a year old because there was fresh greenery from this summer season with no overlying layer of mud or the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leibman stressed that there were no indications that such events were more than the normal process of lake formation in the area and predicted that the hole she inspected would end up being a lake in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also stressed that she sees no signs of current or imminent warming producing a great destabilization of permafrost in the Arctic: &quot;You can't say in 20 years it will be 2 degrees warmer so permafrost will be thawing. It will make it 2 degrees warmer, but not thawing - at least in the far north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the south, where you have only patches of permafrost, the response may be a little bit more active,&quot; she said. &quot;But what we see now is permafrost with minus 1 degree temperature [Celsius] now - after a climate warming of 1 and a half degrees - permafrost temperature is minus 0.1 degree, but not above zero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage you to listen to our conversation and learn more.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- China's plans for 50 coal gasification plants will produce an estimated 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year and contribute significantly to climate&nbsp;change, according to a report released Wednesday by Greenpeace East Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plants, aimed in part at reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants in China's largest cities, will shift that pollution to other regions, mostly in the northwest, and generate enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas produced by fossil fuels, said the organization, which is based in Beijing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If China builds all 50 plants, the carbon dioxide they produce will equal about an eighth of China's current total carbon dioxide emissions, which come mostly from coal-burning power plants and factories, the organization said. Two of the plants have already been built as pilot projects, three more are under construction, 16 have been given the green light to be built and the rest are in various planning stages, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, the government announced a plan to alleviate air pollution in China's notoriously smoggy cities. The plan would reduce coal use in the most populated areas by 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, officials have been looking for other ways to provide power for those areas, including the building of scores of coal-to-gas plants, mostly in northwest China. They would take the place of current coal-burning power plants in China's most populated areas, including the heavily polluted northern region that includes the cities of Beijing and Tianjin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal-to-gas, or coal gasification, is a water-intensive process that generates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas destabilizing the world's climate. Many scientists have criticized the process and said its use would be even worse for global climate conditions than burning coal, which produces carbon dioxide and other pollutants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese state-owned power companies categorize proposed plants as ''clean energy'' or ''new energy.'' China is responsible for half of the annual global coal consumption and is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the United States. Chinese and American officials have been engaged in on-and-off negotiations for years over how each nation can pledge to cap or reduce its coal use to try to avert severe climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, two Duke University researchers published a commentary in Nature Climate&nbsp;Change that said Chinese policy makers should delay the huge investments in coal-to-gas projects ''to avoid a potentially costly and environmentally damaging outcome. An even better decision would be to cancel the program entirely.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li Shuo, a climate analyst at Greenpeace East Asia, said in a statement on Tuesday that ''China risks a boom in a destructive, expensive and outdated technology, which could undermine its efforts on climate&nbsp;change and further damage its environment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighty percent of the 50 plants would be in northwest China, in the provinces or regions of Xinjiang, western Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Gansu. All these areas suffer from severe water shortages. The Greenpeace report said that besides the surge in carbon dioxide emissions, the plants would also worsen water scarcity, water pollution and air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the two operational plants is in Inner Mongolia, where the city of Hohhot has reached an agreement with Beijing Enterprises Group to provide Beijing with four billion cubic meters of synthetic natural gas per year. The gas from the coal gasification plant there, operated by the China Datang Corporation, would equal half of Beijing's current annual gas demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greenpeace report cited research from Tsinghua University showing that this agreement would reduce coal use by 8.94 million tons per year in Beijing, but increase it by 12 million tons in Inner Mongolia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There would also be a net growth of 3.77 million tons per year in carbon dioxide emissions and an increase of 24 million tons in water consumption, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the National Energy Administration of China announced that it would place limits on proposed coal-to-gas projects, banning those that would produce less than two billion cubic meters of gas per year and coal-to-oil projects producing less than one million tons of oil per year. The energy administration developed the limits ''after new technology sparked an investment spree regardless of environmental and economic realities,'' Xinhua, the state news agency, reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ma Wen, a Greenpeace researcher on coal-to-gas projects, said in a written statement, ''The new N.E.A. directive shows that China's energy authority is clearly concerned that its big plan for coal-to-gas plants in western China, seen as a solution for eastern China's air pollution problem, could go wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But the document stops short at merely stressing the necessity of closely monitoring the projects' development,'' he said. ''It doesn't seem that Beijing is fully aware that western China, including Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia, don't have the environmental or water capacity to accommodate its coal-to-gas initiative, or that by 2030 the projects in total could produce almost 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma are among the most vocal Republican skeptics of the science that burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming, but a new study to be released Thursday found that their states would be among the biggest economic winners under a regulation proposed by President Obama to fight climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Rhodium Group, both research organizations, concluded that the regulation would cut demand for electricity from coal -- the nation's largest source of carbon pollution -- but create robust new demand for natural gas, which has just half the carbon footprint of coal. It found that the demand for natural gas would, in turn, drive job creation, corporate revenue and government royalties in states that produce it, which, in addition to Oklahoma and Texas, include Arkansas and Louisiana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded that the rule would hurt states where coal production is a central part of the economy -- chiefly Wyoming, the nation's largest coal producer. States that produce both coal and natural gas, such as Pennsylvania, would experience an economic trade-off as diminished coal production was replaced by new natural gas production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency assigns states different targets for cutting planet-warming carbon pollution from power plants and requires them to devise individual compliance plans to meet the standards. Experts say the regulation could transform the nation's power system by shuttering coal plants, driving new wind and solar power, and spurring states to enact taxes on carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study took into account the economic costs imposed by the regulation and concluded that it would raise electricity rates by up to 10 percent in some parts of the country and eventually freeze coal production. But even taking those costs into account, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas together would experience an annual net economic benefit of up to about $16 billion, according to the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The irony is that some of the states that have been the loudest in opposing E.P.A. climate regulations have the most to gain in terms of actual economic interest,'' said Trevor Houser, an analyst at the Rhodium Group and a co-author of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report analyzed the economic impact of the rule on 11 regions of the country and found that Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas would collectively have to make the steepest pollution cuts, per capita, in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas' reduction alone would account for 19 percent of the nation's total emission reductions from power plants. But even as the states made those steep cuts, the report found that, over all, their economies would benefit, although at the expense of coal-dependent states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a significant net gain for natural gas-producing states but exacerbates the loss for coal-producing states,'' Mr. Houser said. ''But more and more states are producing natural gas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gain for Texas would come at the direct expense of coal-producing Wyoming, Mr. Houser said. While Texas currently buys coal from Wyoming and burns it for electricity, it would be able to comply with the new rule by ceasing to buy that coal and instead producing and burning more low-carbon natural gas within the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his book ''Fed Up,'' Mr. Perry dismissed climate&nbsp;change as a ''contrived phony mess that is falling apart.'' In a May letter to Mr. Obama, he wrote, ''Mr. President, your words promise an energy renaissance while your policies are strangling the energy industry.'' Mr. Perry's office declined to comment on the study, which was to be released Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Inhofe, who has called climate&nbsp;change at the hands of humans a hoax, did not question the study's findings and agreed that, in the short term, his state's economy was likely to benefit from the E.P.A.'s proposed rule. But he said that the uneven impact of the rule nationally -- a lift to natural gas-producing states but a hit to coal-producing states -- would also be felt in Oklahoma. For example, he said, there are plans to build a new coal mine north of Poteau, Okla. ''It's a very significant part of a somewhat poor part of the state,'' he said, adding that ''they would be devastated'' if the regulation were enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on Wednesday, Mr. Inhofe signaled that he intended to fight the plan. He asked Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., who was testifying about the climate&nbsp;change regulation, ''Say a state like Oklahoma does not develop a plan?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what the Obama administration fears: that Republican governors, like Mary Fallin in Oklahoma, will defy the agency by refusing to submit climate&nbsp;change plans. Mr. Perry has defied previous federal clean air regulations by refusing to submit plans for Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Clean Air Act, if a state does not submit a plan, the E.P.A. must step in and force the state to comply with a federally developed plan -- an outcome that could ignite a standoff between states and the federal government over control of state energy economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Hal Quinn, the president of the National Mining Association, a lobbying group, called the proposed rule ''a stunning attempt to completely transform how we generate, transmit and use electricity.'' He added, ''Americans need E.P.A. to give them a break before it breaks the electric grid and the American economy along with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chamber's Republican leader, is already planning legislation to block the rule. For now, any effort in Congress to stop it or roll it back would fail in the Democratic-majority Senate, but that will change if Republicans win a majority in the chamber in the midterm elections this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McConnell, whose state is one of the nation's largest producers of coal, sees blocking the climate rule as a top agenda item if the Republicans gain control of the Senate next year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ESTEVAN, Saskatchewan -- So much soot belched from the old power plant here that Mike Zeleny would personally warn the neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the wind was blowing in a certain direction,'' Mr. Zeleny said, ''we'd call Mrs. Robinson down the street and tell her not to put out her laundry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That coal plant is long gone, replaced by a much larger and cleaner one along the vast Saskatchewan prairie. Sooty shirts and socks are a thing of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as with even the most modern coal plants, its smokestacks still emit enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, the invisible heat-trapping gas that is the main contributor to global warming. So this fall, a gleaming new maze of pipes and tanks -- topped with what looks like the Tin Man's hat -- will suck up 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from one of the boilers so it can be shipped out for burial, deep underground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is any hope of staving off the worst effects of climate&nbsp;change, many scientists say, this must be part of it -- capturing the carbon that spews from power plants and locking it away, permanently. For now, they contend, the world is too dependent on fossil fuels to do anything less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all goes as planned, the effort in Saskatchewan will be the first major one of its kind at a power plant, the equivalent of taking about 250,000 cars off the road. And at least in theory, that carbon dioxide will be kept out of the atmosphere forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Think about how far we've come,'' said Mr. Zeleny, who recently retired after four decades here, most recently as plant manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite President Obama's push to rein in emissions from power plants across the United States, coal is not going away anytime soon. The administration expects coal will still produce nearly a third of the nation's electricity in 2030, down from about 40 percent today, even if Mr. Obama's plan survives the political onslaught against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge is even more stark overseas. China already burns almost as much coal as all other nations combined, and its appetite keeps expanding. Worldwide, coal consumption in 2020 will be about twice what it was in 2000, according to the United States Energy Information Administration, and will continue to grow for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the abundant natural gas unleashed by fracking, while cleaner than coal, is a major source of greenhouse gases. Ultimately, many scientists say, those emissions will need to be trapped and stored, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you want to carry on using those fossil hydrocarbons, that means cleaning up their emissions,'' said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh. Capturing carbon, he said, ''is the single best way of doing that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it is no magic bullet. Because it requires so much energy, sucking up carbon reduces a plant's ability to make electricity -- the whole point of its existence. There are basic questions of whether carbon dioxide can be safely stored underground. And the technology is expensive. Updating the Saskatchewan plant alone cost $1.2 billion -- two-thirds of which went for the equipment to remove the gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pine woods of Kemper County, Miss., another carbon-capture effort is taking shape, in a massive new power plant that will be fed a steady diet of coal from the strip mine next door. Bruce Harrington, the operations manager, likened the hulking beast to an anthill: It seems curiously quiet on the outside, but deep within an army of workers is cutting, welding and testing. Disturb it, he said, and thousands of people will come pouring out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battling delays, the plant's owner, Southern Company, hopes to have it open next year. But it is more complex than the Saskatchewan effort, and the price tag has ballooned to $5.5 billion, more than double the original estimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It'll work,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''It won't be easy at first, but it'll work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the world has known for decades how to capture carbon dioxide from power plants, scant progress has been made. The United States and other nations have paid for research and helped some projects -- Canada gave $220 million to the Saskatchewan plant's owner, SaskPower, and Southern Company received $270 million from the Department of Energy -- but the costs are high enough that few other power companies have done much beyond study the concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's no market,'' said Edward S. Rubin, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, unless governments impose ''a requirement to substantially reduce emissions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is precisely what is happening here in Saskatchewan, given the Canadian government's recent restrictions on coal plants both old and new. But whether Mr. Obama's new rules are aggressive enough to spur a change in the United States remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts see the Obama policy as a turning point, a moment that could help drive the business of collecting carbon dioxide. Yet the administration has been wary of pushing too hard, warning that any move to force existing coal plants to siphon off their carbon dioxide emissions ''would affect the nationwide cost and supply of electricity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration plans to require that future coal plants capture their carbon dioxide, a rule that some utilities and politicians, particularly from coal-producing states, have vowed to fight. But for now the mandate is largely an empty one, because coal is so uneconomical compared with natural gas that no one expects many new American coal plants to be built in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you give power companies a loophole, they're not going to do the thing,'' said Howard J. Herzog, the director of a research program on carbon capture and storage, known as C.C.S., at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Why should we even consider C.C.S.? Let's just do natural gas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So at a time when many experts say 10 or more projects need to be undertaken to improve the technology and reduce costs, the opposite is happening. Work to modify a coal plant in Texas is expected to start this year, but there are only a few other projects worldwide, all in the planning stage. And as some government subsidies have begun to dry up -- notably, federal stimulus funds in the United States -- several efforts have been delayed or canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm concerned,'' Mr. Haszeldine said. ''Governments around the world see C.C.S. as a good thing. But they're not pushing hard enough on enabling that to happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology has been around, in one form or another, for nearly a century, used at some refineries and other industrial plants, including large ones in Illinois, North Dakota, Canada and Norway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But removing carbon dioxide from the swirl of gases unleashed at a power plant is challenging, akin to plucking just a few colored Ping-Pong balls out of the air from a swarm of mostly white ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do the job, the equipment is enormous. At the Saskatchewan plant, called Boundary Dam, a liquid chemical latches onto carbon dioxide molecules after being sprayed onto a plume of combustion gases. The ''stripper,'' where the carbon dioxide is finally pulled away, is 160 feet high -- so high it pokes out of the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the equipment costs, efficiency is lost because some of the steam that would normally generate electricity goes to the stripper instead. And a monstrous motor compresses the carbon dioxide -- until it effectively becomes a liquid -- for transport. All told, capturing the carbon dioxide at Boundary Dam will sap electricity generation by about 20 percent, using as much energy as about 25,000 homes. Experts call it the ''energy penalty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storage Concerns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injecting liquids deep underground can present problems, too. Pumping wastewater from oil and gas production into the ground has been linked to spates of small earthquakes in Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carbon dioxide could taint drinking water, or eventually rise to the surface and bubble into the atmosphere, defeating the entire purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most extreme case, leaking carbon dioxide could harm or kill people. In Cameroon, a volcanic lake suddenly released a cloud of naturally forming carbon dioxide in 1986, suffocating 1,700 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, carbon dioxide has been buried around the world with few problems. In Norway, a million tons have been stored every year since 1996, injected into sandstone about 3,000 feet beneath the North Sea. (By some estimates, that site alone could store as much carbon dioxide as the world could capture for years.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking the right geological features could minimize the risk of earthquakes and leaks. But even then, storage wells would have to be monitored, presumably forever, at a cost someone would have to bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If done poorly, storing carbon dioxide can cause problems, said David Hawkins, the director of climate programs with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. ''But that's also true with operating an oil refinery.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Economic Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Boundary Dam's carbon dioxide will not simply be buried in storage wells. Instead, the emissions from burning one fossil fuel -- coal -- will become a tool to extract and consume yet another: oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being sold and shipped through a 40-mile pipeline to an oil field, the carbon dioxide will be pumped into old wells, where it will mix with the oil inside, making it flow better. The process is known as enhanced oil recovery, and while some of the carbon dioxide will come up with the oil, it will be compressed and injected again. Over time, nearly all of it should remain underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil and gas industry has done this for decades, mostly with naturally occurring carbon dioxide that accumulates underground. But each year in North America, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide from industry are used as well. Selling that carbon dioxide to the oil industry helps make a business case for capturing it at places like Boundary Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice could be expanded at many oil fields around the United States and beyond, experts say, potentially storing billions of tons of carbon dioxide and serving as a bridge to the day when it becomes necessary, and economical, to store the gas elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prod the industry, Congress is weighing incentives, including tax credits, loan guarantees and tax exemptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's not going to happen by itself,'' said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat who is chairman of a Finance Committee panel on energy. ''There ought to be broad bipartisan support for measures like these.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the apparent incongruity of using carbon dioxide captured from coal to produce more fossil fuels, Mr. Hawkins said his group had struggled with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our view is that the most likely consequence is not to encourage more consumption of oil,'' he said. Rather, drawing more oil from existing fields will reduce the need to develop new ones, ''and that's an environmental plus,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boundary Dam's owner will evaluate the project for two years before deciding whether to capture carbon dioxide from other boilers at the plant, which it says it could do at lower cost. Part of the calculus is that, less than 10 miles away, there is an almost limitless supply of cheap coal that it otherwise might not be able to use as Canada's new standards take hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We had to figure out if we could continue using coal as a fuel source for the next 100 years,'' said Mr. Zeleny, the former employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the United States and the rest of the world, the prognosis for carbon capture is less clear. If the United States moves forward, China and other countries may make bigger strides as well. This month, the United States and China announced plans for several collaborative research projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How this will play out over time is hard to tell,'' said Professor Rubin of Carnegie Mellon. ''Inevitably, there will be a balance between technological capability, cost and political realities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were even more upbeat. Dan Reicher, who directs the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University, said the Obama administration's recent moves on emissions could be a catalyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're finally getting some clarity on where we're headed on carbon emissions,'' Mr. Reicher said, arguing that collecting carbon dioxide could become a significant industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We need every tool in the toolbox to address climate&nbsp;change,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;China appears serious about addressing pollution and greenhouse gasses that result from its reliance on coal. The presence of John D. Podesta, counselor to President Obama, at talks between the United States and China is among the signals that on climate change, the two countries have common interests that might be addressed together. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         The presence of John D. Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and now counselor to President Obama, at the recent United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing was a surprise. He is not a China expert. But the Chinese like old hands, aides with proximity to the Oval Office, and Mr. Podesta fills that bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         In addition, Mr. Podesta is passionate about climate&nbsp;change. He returned to the White House this year to help Mr. Obama fulfill his ambitious agenda to reduce coal consumption in the United States, and to shape a new global climate treaty to be negotiated in Paris at the end of 2015.  China's leadership, faced with growing public anger over environmental pollution, is also moving toward  curbing the use of coal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          No one doubts that China must act, and will do something about limiting the use of coal. The question is what. China is the world's leading producer and consumer of coal, accounting for 49 percent of coal consumption in 2012, according to the Energy Information Administration, an agency within the United States Department of Energy.  China is also the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide - 29 percent of the world's total emissions in 2012 - far ahead of the United States in second place with 16 percent.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           So in contrast to the mistrust that pervades the strategic relationship between the United States and China, climate&nbsp;change has emerged as one area where there are common interests that can be worked on together. During the Strategic and Economic Dialogue talks on July 9-10, Mr. Podesta met with Liu He, considered by many as President Xi Jinping's top man on the economy. Last year Mr. Liu was elevated to director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, a powerful body akin to the White House's National Economic Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      Mr. Liu and Mr. Podesta got the measure of each other, and discussed overarching economic and environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     At the worker-bee level, Chinese and American negotiators agreed to an important pilot project dreamed up at the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, headed by Carlos Pascual. Under the accord, China will choose two cities to study the economic and environmental impacts of switching from coal-fired industrial boilers, most commonly used in steel and cement plants, to natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      That may not sound like such a stunning achievement, but coal-burning industrial boilers contribute huge amounts of pollution in China. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       A common perception is that the prime villains in air pollution are China's coal-burning power plants, said Ailun Yang, an energy analyst at the World Resources Institute who splits her time between the United States and China. But most of China's coal-burning power plants were built in the last 15 years, she said, and are relatively efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       On the other hand, about 17 percent of China's coal goes to fire industrial boilers, and most of these are older and highly polluting. &quot;That's why it's important to address the boilers at steel and cement plants,&quot; Ms. Yang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       Chinese and American researchers chosen by the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing and the State Department will work together on the study, which is expected to be completed by January.  By then, China will be in the midst of considering its formula for reducing coal consumption to be presented at the Paris conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         China's chief climate&nbsp;change negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, who attended the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and also met with Mr. Podesta, said on July 14 that China was considering a mandatory cap on coal use. How that cap would work and the timeline for phasing it in were not clear. But it would appear that weaning heavy industry from coal-burning industrial boilers might be part of China's plan for Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         One immediate problem is China's shortage of natural gas. Under the 30-year deal signed by Russia and China in May to pipe natural gas from Siberia to China, deliveries will not begin until at least 2018. China is trying to speed up the production of shale gas, but supplies are far from meeting demand. Liquid natural gas imported from Australia by ship is largely used on the east coast because China lacks the pipelines to take it west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           Still, fears of social unrest over pollution will force the Chinese government to find ways to use more natural gas in place of coal, Ms. Yang said, and the joint American-Chinese study is a promising step forward.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former US vice-president and green campaigner Al Gore has criticised Australia's decision to scrap the carbon tax, calling it a disappointing step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore said Thursday's abolition of the mechanism means that &quot;Australia is falling behind other major industrialised nations in the growing global effort to reduce carbon emissions and ensure a clean and prosperous future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(It is) a disappointing step for a country that continues to experience the worsening consequences of the climate crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore said he took some solace in the likelihood that Australia will maintain the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate&nbsp;Change Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, also voiced disappointment at the carbon tax repeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European Union regrets the repeal of Australia's carbon pricing mechanism just as new carbon pricing initiatives are emerging all around the world,&quot; Hedegaard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU is convinced that pricing carbon is not only the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, but also the tool to make the economic paradigm shift the world needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why the EU will continue to work towards global carbon pricing with all international partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU has had an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in place since 2005. The scheme, which covers around 45% of total greenhouse emissions from the 28 EU countries, was due to be linked to Australia's own emissions trading scheme, but this will now not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK, which is part of the EU ETS, has declined to officially criticise Australia over the abolition, although a senior UK Conservative recently condemned the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, over his &quot;reckless&quot; approach to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeal of the carbon price means that Australia now has no primary mechanism designed to lower carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Gore warns that Australia will fall behind other industrialised nations in the effort to reduce carbon emissions</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former environment secretary Owen Paterson is to give the annual lecture for Britain's most prominent climate sceptic group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson, who slashed funding for adapting to climate&nbsp;change, agreed to give the lecture days after leaving office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GWPF is led by Nigel Lawson and its annual lecture has previously been given by high-profile climate sceptics including, in 2013, the former Australian prime minister John Howard, who described those urging action as zealots for whom &quot;the cause has become a substitute religion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson's repeated failure to endorse the conclusions of the world's scientists and governments that climate&nbsp;change is dangerous and caused by burning fossil fuels led to the assumption that he was a sceptic, but the announcement of his support for the GWPF confirms it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Lawson, chairman of the GWPF, said: &quot;I felt Owen Paterson would give an excellent and thoughtful lecture. At the time I invited him, he was still in post as environment secretary, a job of considerable relevance to the successful development of UK shale gas, which the GWPF strongly supports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confirmation of Paterson's views has prompted campaigners to question the government's commitment to tackling climate&nbsp;change. Andrew Pendleton of Friends of the Earth said: &quot;Paterson held an office to do things that help protect the UK public from the impacts of climate&nbsp;change and it is extremely good that he has gone. But there are still questions to answer about how this government is dealing with climate&nbsp;change: how seriously do they take it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Stewart of Greenpeace UK said: &quot;Some people would say that for the last two years Paterson has been delivering a rolling 24/7 lecture for the GWPF. Maybe it's for the best that he's come out of the closet and formalised the relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Ward, policy director at the LSE's Grantham research institute on climate&nbsp;change and the environment, said: &quot;This provides a glimpse of how far the tentacles of Lord Lawson's lobby group have extended into government departments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson made a series of sceptical comments during his time as environment secretary. In September 2013, he said: &quot;People get very emotional about (climate&nbsp;change) and I think we should just accept that the climate has been changing for centuries.&quot; In June 2013, he said: &quot;The climate has not changed. The temperature hasn't changed in 17 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Conservative party spokesman declined to say whether it had been a mistake to appoint a climate-change sceptic as environment secretary. He said the words in the letter sent by David Cameron's to Paterson after the latter's sacking spoke for themselves: &quot;I would like you to know how much I have personally appreciated your friendship, loyalty and support over the years, and your commitment to the government's priorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GWPF is a charitable foundation, but in May it announced it would be setting up a separate lobbying arm after advice from the Charity Commission on the conflict between charitable status and political campaigning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Blueprints for Taming the Climate Crisis,'' by Eduardo Porter (Economic Scene column, July 9):</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any blueprint for grappling with climate&nbsp;change must simultaneously factor in the water use involved in the technological options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a fact inadequately addressed in the United Nations report cited by Mr. Porter. Electricity technologies are no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted in a 2011 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, low-carbon-emitting electricity technologies are not necessarily low-water use. We need to carefully consider the carbon/water trade-offs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the role nuclear energy technology can play, the Union of Concerned Scientists report explains, ''On average in 2008, plants in the U.S. nuclear fleet withdrew nearly eight times more freshwater than natural gas plants per unit of electricity generated, and 11 percent more than coal plants.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead we should pursue those technologies that are both low-carbon and low-water, like solar photovoltaic cells, wind power and energy efficiency. The energy technologies we choose to power tomorrow's world can -- and should -- protect our finite water resources while reducing carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron is warned today by Graca Machel, widow of the late South African statesman Nelson Mandela, that unless world leaders made 2015 a year for development, the consequence would not just be poverty but also military conflicts from which the rich would be unable to protect themselves for decades to come.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Machel's first global political act since the death of her husband last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter to Cameron has also been signed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the rock star Bono, the Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, the billionaire entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim and the 17-year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter presses the prime minister to take the lead on an international UN framework on climate&nbsp;change in 2015, and to secure an agreement on new tighter UN millennium development goals, an issue on which he took a personal lead last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter coincides with the anniversary of Mandela's birthday - and also the day on which the current negotiations on replacing the millennium development goals are due to close. At present there is little sign of progress, with signs that there will be an increase in the number to 17 and a proliferation in targets to 145. That number is widely seen as unwieldy. The joint letter warns: &quot;A growing insecurity caused by unequal access to increasingly scarce natural resources leads to tragic conflicts from which nobody - no elite, no matter how rich - can hide. This is an entirely plausible outcome of a complacent business-as-usual approach to 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which world do you want to live in by 2030? Which world it will be depends upon the decision you make in 2015, and the preparations we make for it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter also calls for a global movement to unite development, climate and human rights campaigns around this agenda. A campaign called Action/2015 - backed by organisations from around the world, from Amnesty International to the All Africa Conference of Churches, Save the Children to the ONE Campaign - will be launched in January 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter says: &quot;The good news is a global movement is coming together for 2015 and the future, inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela: 'Like slavery, like apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is manmade and it can be overcome by the actions of human beings.' Climate&nbsp;change too can and must be remedied by the actions of human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigners fear the summit on climate&nbsp;change called by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is already in the balance. Cameron is under pressure to confirm he will go to the summit on 23 September, and make a substantial pledge, but has so far made no commitment, citing the Scottish referendum and his own party conference. Efforts are also being made to galvanise the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who has so far said little on the subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYDNEY, Australia -- Opposition politicians and environmentalists in Australia reacted with dismay Thursday to the country's repeal of laws requiring large companies to pay for carbon emissions, saying that it made Australia the first country to reverse progress on fighting climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate voted 39 to 32 on Thursday to repeal the so-called carbon tax after Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conservative government secured the support of a number of independent senators. The House of Representatives had voted earlier in the week to repeal the unpopular measure, which has been a highly contentious issue in Australian politics for seven years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax was devised to penalize hundreds of Australia's biggest producers of carbon emissions, setting a price of 23 Australian dollars, or $21.50, per metric ton of carbon dioxide when it was put into effect in 2012 under then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Labor Party, which is now in the opposition. The price rose to 25 Australian dollars this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott, of the conservative Liberal Party, who took office in September, made repealing the tax a central pledge of his election campaign, arguing that ending it would reduce electricity prices and enhance economic growth. But he struggled twice to get the measure through the Senate before the vote Thursday. The government now plans to introduce a range of measures that it says will encourage business to reduce pollution, rather than penalizing polluters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the vote Thursday, Mr. Abbott characterized the tax as a ''useless, destructive tax, which damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which didn't actually help the environment.'' He called it a ''9 percent impost on power prices, a $9 billion handbrake on our economy,'' and said the repeal would save the average household 550 dollars a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is among the world's biggest producers of carbon emissions on a per capita basis. The government is committed to reducing emissions to 5 percent below levels recorded in 2000 by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians from Labor and the smaller Greens party said the repeal would undermine Australia's efforts to address climate&nbsp;change. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, described Mr. Abbott as an ''environmental vandal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Today, Tony Abbott has made Australia the first country in the world to reverse action on climate&nbsp;change,'' Mr. Shorten said. Christine Milne, a senator from Tasmania and leader of the Greens party, said, ''History will judge Tony Abbott harshly for his denial of global warming and his undermining of Australia's effort to address it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, a Sydney-based advocacy group, said that some governments had pulled back from carbon reduction targets, including Japan after the Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in 2011, but that ''no one else in the world has repealed a working, functioning carbon pricing mechanism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are taking a monumentally reckless backward leap even as other countries are stepping up to climate action,'' Mr. Connor said in an interview. He said that Australia is the highest per capita emitter of carbon in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the group of developed countries, and that it ranks in the top 20 globally, emitting around 25 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person every year. ''Australia's economy is much more carbon-intensive than the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Connor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott has said that the repeal will lead to lower energy costs for consumers. But Mr. Connor said that while Australian electricity prices have indeed risen, that was due in part to power companies investing in infrastructure. ''The government effectively used the carbon tax as the scapegoat for higher energy costs,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But representatives of major industries, including agriculture and mining, said that the costs passed along to other businesses because of the emissions penalty were high. While the agriculture sector was exempt from directly paying the tax, its costs ''hit Australian farmers every time they paid for essential electricity, fertilizer, chemicals and fuel supplies,'' Brent Finlay, president of the National Farmers' Federation, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brendan Pearson, head of the Minerals Council of Australia, said in a statement that the removal of ''the world's biggest carbon tax is an important step towards regaining the competitive edge that Australia lost over the last decade.'' The council estimated that the tax cost the mining industry 1.2 billion dollars per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of independent grocers also applauded the repeal, saying that the cost of electricity and refrigerant gases had skyrocketed since the carbon tax was introduced. ''A small, corner store operator will save about 17,000 Australian dollars a year,'' said Jos de Bruin of Master Grocers Australia, which represents about 2,400 independent supermarkets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYDNEY, Australia -- Australia's repeal of laws requiring large companies to pay for carbon emissions is among the starkest expressions worldwide of how economic concerns have complicated efforts to combat climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are viewing the move as a blow to plans for countries to knit together markets for trading emissions allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a long political battle over the costs of the Australian plan, the repeal won final legislative approval on Thursday with the strong backing of the conservative government of Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The plan, which was built around a tax on carbon emissions and was one of the most ambitious and prominent of its type, was a contentious issue in Australian politics since it was enacted by the previous center-left government in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians and environmentalists in Australia reacted with dismay, saying the move made Australia the first country to reverse progress on fighting climate&nbsp;change. It was also viewed with disappointment by proponents of establishing a global carbon-pricing system as the most effective way of reining in emissions. Australia is one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions, and its policies have been watched closely by other nations as they struggle to agree on ways to control global warming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's system was of particular interest to other countries because it was to have been linked with a similar trading program in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning next year, Australian businesses were to be able to buy European emissions allowances to use under the Australian program. A full two-way link between the two systems was to be in force by July 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This arrangement would have connected Europe's program, the world's largest, to what looked likely to be the third-largest. The deal might have served as a pilot for linking other systems emerging around the world, including those in China and California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is quite a setback to the global discussion of linking schemes and moving toward a global carbon market,'' said Marcus Ferdinand, an analyst at Point Carbon, a research firm based in Oslo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian vote also further complicates long-running efforts by the United Nations to forge a global climate&nbsp;change treaty in 2015, aimed at committing the world's largest economies to making deep cuts in their carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fall, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, government leaders are expected to lay out their proposed domestic commitments for that deal. Australia's vote to gut its signature climate policy is likely to come under severe criticism at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, officials expressed disappointment at Australia's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The European Union regrets the repeal of Australia's carbon-pricing mechanism just as new carbon-pricing initiatives are emerging all around the world,'' said the European climate action commissioner, Connie Hedegaard. ''The E.U. is convinced that pricing carbon is not only the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions but also the tool to make the economic paradigm shift the world needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax was devised to penalize hundreds of Australia's biggest emitters of carbon, setting a price of 23 Australian dollars, or $21.50, per metric ton of carbon dioxide when it was put into effect in 2012, when Julia Gillard of the Labor Party was the prime minister. The price rose to 25 Australian dollars per metric ton this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Senate voted 39 to 32 on Thursday to approve the repeal of the measure. The House of Representatives voted earlier in the week to repeal it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott, of the Liberal Party, who took office in September, made repealing the tax a central pledge of his election campaign, arguing that ending it would reduce electricity prices and enhance economic growth. But he struggled twice to get the measure through the Senate before the vote on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government now plans to introduce a range of measures that it says will encourage business to reduce pollution, rather than penalizing polluters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the vote on Thursday, Mr. Abbott characterized the tax as a ''useless, destructive tax, which damaged jobs, which hurt families' cost of living and which didn't actually help the environment.'' He called it a ''9 percent impost on power prices, a $9 billion handbrake on our economy.'' .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian vote resonated in the United States, where environmental advocates have tried and failed for years to enact legislation that would put a price tag on carbon pollution. Opponents of carbon pricing, led by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, have sought to make the issue politically toxic, and groups financed by the brothers' company, Koch Industries, have run aggressive campaigns against lawmakers who support climate&nbsp;change policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are drinking Foster's and putting shrimp on the barbie,'' said a celebratory Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that receives financing from Koch Industries. It is running television ads ahead of the November midterm elections to try to unseat lawmakers who have supported carbon pricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pyle predicted that other nations with carbon-pricing policies would follow Australia. ''Europe is going to be the next one to do wholesale reversals of these policies,'' he said. ''It's like salmon heading upstream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who is an opponent of President Obama's climate&nbsp;change policies, said in a statement: ''What Prime Minister Abbott has done is show true leadership.'' he addedd, ''Australia's carbon tax was certain to provide all pain and no gain for Australia's economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of political support to enact a carbon-pricing law, President Obama has instead proposed a federal regulation that would force states to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Mr. Vitter said Australia's vote would give strength to Republicans' efforts to repeal those regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates of a stricter climate policy in the United States said that they were deeply disheartened by Australia's vote but that they drew lessons from it in their efforts to push through a future price on carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a tremendous setback,'' said Steve Valk, communications director for the Citizens Climate Lobby, an advocacy group devoted to enacting a carbon tax in the United States. ''The signal it sends to us is that they should have given the money back. If they had structured it so all the revenue was returned to households, the political will would have made it impossible to repeal it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia is among the world's biggest producers of carbon emissions per capita. The government is committed to reducing emissions by 2020 to 95 percent of the levels recorded in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians from Labor and the smaller Greens Party said the repeal would undermine Australia's efforts to address climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current Labor leader, Bill Shorten, described Mr. Abbott as an ''environmental vandal'' and said, ''Today, Tony Abbott has made Australia the first country in the world to reverse action on climate&nbsp;change.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A fresh look at controversial efforts to nourish salmon and store carbon. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: Video of the 2012 Haida iron fertilization effort Watch on YouTube.]<BR>Two years ago this month, an edge-pushing environmental entrepreneur and a company formed by a Native Canadian village set off a wave of international protest by dispersing a pink slurry of 100 tons of iron-rich dust over one of the 60-mile-wide ocean eddies that routinely drift across the salmon feeding grounds of the Gulf of Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their goal, in the face of steep declines in Pacific salmon catches, was to trigger a plankton population explosion with the infusion of iron, a vital nutrient that's lacking in those waters. Volcanic eruptions had been shown to do the same thing. Why not humans?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plankton bloom, in theory, would nourish millions of juvenile fish that circulate in the Gulf before returning to the coast to spawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with a boosted catch, a second hoped-for payoff was the sale of carbon credits on international markets aimed at offsetting greenhouse gas pollution by financing projects that absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide - typically by planting trees but in this case through spurring plankton growth. More than $2 million was invested in the project through the tribal company, the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests mainly came from groups and scientists critical of geo-engineering, large-scale efforts to harness or control the shared environment to serve human needs - particularly if the efforts were private. They asserted the project violated international ocean-dumping rules and a moratorium on ocean fertilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russ George, the iron-dust entrepreneur (who is now in a legal fight with some of his former partners), has defended the effort as stewardship, not pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't count on a quick resolution of either the litigation or any prosecution arising from a long-running investigation by Canada's environment agency, which has asserted in court that the project violated Canadian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that independent scientists have appraised the 2012 iron pulse, and millions of young salmon that were at sea that summer are heading up streams, and into nets, it's at least possible to begin assessing outcomes and lessons from this freelance effort at treating the open sea like a farmer's field - and a carbon safe-deposit box.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lesson is that while privately financed science is playing a growing role in advancing knowledge, proprietary and legal issues can limit vital transparency. Most of the data collected during the iron-seeding effort in 2012 - some gathered with instruments loaned by Canadian and United States ocean agencies - are not yet public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(George says this is in part because of the lawsuits and Canadian investigation, in which computers were seized.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been learned, nonetheless. NASA satellites independently measured a rare late-summer bloom of phytoplankton that independent researchers tied to the iron release. But those same researchers, led by Peng Xiu of the University of Maine, concluded in a paper earlier this year that the small area and short lifetime of the bloom meant its didn't come close to comparing to the carbon absorption from a 2008 eruption and other natural sources of iron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other more conventional (if much smaller) scientific tests of iron fertilization in waters near Antarctica found a mix of results on oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, meaning lots more research needs to be done before anyone can bank on ocean repositories as a significant offset for smokestack carbon dioxide emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that no new basic research of this sort has been initiated in recent years. Researchers say funding agencies have been rendered gun-shy by the continuing battle between George and his main critic, the technology watchdog organization ETC Group, which long predates the salmon project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the prime question for the fishing communities in the region: Did the iron supplement boost salmon spawning runs and harvests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George insists the project was &quot;a phenomenal success,&quot; pointing to big recent salmon hauls along the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper just published in the Journal of Plankton Research, two Canadian marine scientists, Sonia Batten and James Gower, reported evidence of a critical intervening step - a growth spurt in just the right kind of tiny animals, crustacean zooplankton, that young salmon thrive on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Batten and other fisheries scientists warns there's too much natural variability in both North Pacific conditions and salmon reproduction to tease out an impact from 100 tons of dust spread on a single eddy in the North Pacific in single year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's one more question. Are there better options for sustaining salmon harvests and sopping CO2 in a cash-strapped world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilf Luedke, Canada's chief of salmon stock assessment for the south British Columbia coast, told me he has nothing against careful tests of deep-sea iron fertilization, but worries that the debate - given the complexity in climate and ocean conditions shaping salmon populations - could distract from more clear-cut, and cheaper, ways to aid salmon, and absorb carbon dioxide, closer to shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include conserving carbon-absorbing eelgrass beds in coastal inlets and continuing to restore salmon rivers and streams long beset by dams, careless logging and encroaching development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't fix oceans in the short term,&quot; he said. &quot;But how we deal with rivers and watersheds, that we can fix right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately-financed science, and creative entrepreneurship, clearly can play an important role in addressing humanity's pressing problems - from reviving struggling coastal economies to feeding the world to stemming climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such efforts have to roll out in ways that don't end up creating more problems than they solve.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISSOULA, Mont. -- President Obama announced a series of climate&nbsp;change initiatives on Wednesday aimed at guarding the electricity supply; improving local planning for flooding, coastal erosion and storm surges; and better predicting landslide risks as sea levels rise and storms and droughts intensify.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions, involving a variety of federal agencies, were among the recommendations of the president's State, Local and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, a group of 26 officials who have worked since November to develop the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the projects involves shoring up the power supply during climate catastrophes, and the Department of Agriculture on Wednesday awarded a total of $236.3 million to eight states to improve electricity infrastructure in rural areas. A government study released in May concluded that climate&nbsp;change would strain utility companies' ability to deliver power as extreme weather damaged power lines and hotter temperatures drove surges in demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agriculture Department also announced new funds to help rural areas that are struggling with drought, although the White House has not said how much money would be allocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling another of the recommendations, the United States Geological Survey and other federal agencies said they would spend $13.1 million to develop advanced three-dimensional mapping data that would allow cities and states to draft strategies in responding to weather-related disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs unveiled a $10 million program to train tribes on climate&nbsp;change adaptations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a guide titled ''Assessing Health Vulnerability to Climate&nbsp;Change'' to help identify health hazards that might be caused by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new initiatives are part of a broader White House push to build support for Mr. Obama's climate agenda. Last month, he detailed an Environmental Protection Agency plan directing states to submit proposals to curb carbon pollution from power plants. The plan takes direct aim at coal-fired plants, the nation's largest source of carbon pollution, and lawmakers from coal-dependent states have called it a ''war on coal.'' The plan is expected to curb demand for coal, shutter coal plants and reduce coal mining jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the pushback from coal-producing areas, Mr. Obama hopes to build political support for the plan by highlighting the local damage that climate&nbsp;change is expected to cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fiercest storm since Haiyan nears land, the Philippines is keen to prove it has learned lessons from last year's tragedy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 2013, at the beginning of the rainy season, the Philippine interior secretary announced that the government was aiming for a casualty-free typhoon season. Just five months later, the country was devastated by the deadliest storm in its history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the island state struggles to repair the damage wreaked by typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people, preparations have long been under way for the next season. The Philippine meteorological agency, Pagasa, recently announced the beginning of this year's rainy season and warned that 18 typhoons could hit the country by the end of December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the country's Climate&nbsp;Change Commission, discussions on how to prepare for the forthcoming year began nearly 12 months in advance. &quot;Both national and local governments are bracing themselves. Typhoon Haiyan was such an enormous event,&quot; said the commission's vice-chairman and executive director, Lucile Sering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also started preparing for the typhoon season early, and admitted to learning important lessons from Haiyan, or Yolanda as it is known in the Philippines. &quot;We have learned a lot from typhoon Yolanda. Our prepositioned goods before were not enough, numbering about 20,000 to 30,000 food packs. We are now preparing at least 50,000 food packs,&quot; said Corazon Soliman, secretary for social welfare and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival this week of typhoon Rammasun, the fiercest storm to threaten the Philippines since Haiyan, is poised to be the first real test of the country's disaster preparedness. Rammasun is expected to bring moderate to intense rainfall of up to 20mm per hour and gusts of up to 160kph (99mph) to eastern coastal regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evacuations have begun in earnest - ferry services have been suspended and schools closed in parts of Luzon island as the category-one storm heads towards the Philppine capital, Manila. On a storm scale of one to five, five is the most severe. Haiyan was a category-five &quot;super-typhoon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With each major storm that hits the Philippines, the majority of funding is usually focused on the relief effort, with not much cash left over to prepare for any future disasters. But non-governmental agencies say this approach is changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, there has been less support for response and intervention, education and child protection because many of the contributions and donations initially go to water, sanitation and health, as far as Unicef is concerned,&quot; said Nonoy Fajardo, a Unicef Philippines disaster risk-reduction expert. &quot;For the first time, donor agencies are now more open to support emergency preparedness unlike before when the emphasis was more on emergency response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Haiyan victims died because they failed to evacuate. A large number of people remained in their houses because they were not fully informed on the strength of the incoming typhoon and the consequences of a storm surge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter how good the system or capability of the government, at the end of the day, it's our people who are exposed to the weather and they have to know,&quot; said Alexander Pama, chief undersecretary of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, a large component of preparation this year has been angled towards education. Training workshops are being offered to every level, from residents to first responders to local government officials. However, with experts warning of stronger typhoons to come, training sessions have had to take on a new element this year, educating people of the &quot;new norms&quot; that the Philippines can expect to experience as climate&nbsp;change causes typhoons to intensify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing people need to be educated about is climate&nbsp;change. Filipinos are not new to typhoons, however, what they knew then may not be appropriate to things that are happening right now,&quot; Pama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef Philippines has a programme on disaster-risk reduction, which recently included climate&nbsp;change adaptation. &quot;This is the first time this part has been established,&quot; Fajardo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding has also poured into data collection. &quot;One of the lessons learned is that the government [local and national] has to gather more data on hazard and risks and then strive to make everyone aware of it,&quot; said Roderic Salve, disaster management services manager at the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project Noah (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) was set up in 2012 as a monitoring and early warning system. It has collated a series of interactive maps, which show the different areas of vulnerability from natural disasters such as typhoons. It is thus able to anticipate the impact of a hazard in a locality and implement the appropriate preparedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NDRRMC is building a new operations centre, which is likely to be a &quot;game-changer&quot;, according to Pama. The new 600sq m nerve centre will improve coordination between the different agencies, using satellite communications with real-time video, voice and data transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole project, which will be funded mainly by local and international donors, is expected to cost P250-300m (&pound;3.4-4m) and will be ready in time for next year's rainy season in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, a major focus has been on the consolidation of different government agency responses during a disaster. &quot;Response differs between people so we need one standardised response,&quot; Sering said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has introduced a system called Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment under which disasters are approached in three to four thematic areas: prevention and mitigation; preparedness; response and recovery; and rehabilitation. Each area has a different cluster of agencies acting on the issues, and representatives from each area meet regularly to ensure cohesion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way a typhoon is being looked at this year is different,&quot; Pama said. &quot;We are approaching this in a tactical way. Before, everyone looked at it with their respective mandate. There needs to be more emphasis on the right hand knowing what the left hand is doing. We're consolidating the different government groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several prominent green Tories have been forced out of their jobs in recent months, and green businesses are worried</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guy is so far out on the environmental extreme, we'll be up to our neck in owls and outta work for every American.&quot; That was George HW Bush, then US president running for re-election, attacking Al Gore, vice-presidential candidate, in 1992, as quoted later in Gore's Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exact correlation between the number of owls and US jobs was never expounded, but what was made clear was that green issues were increasingly a dividing line in culture war at the heart of US politics. With David Cameron's reshuffle of his ministerial posts, fears are growing among moderate politicians in Westminster that a similar attempt to draw a line between left and right on environmental issues is taking place here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what Lynton Crosby would like to see,&quot; one senior Tory told the Guardian, referring to the prime minister's electoral adviser from Australia, where green politics are if anything even more polarised than in the US. &quot;But whether the higher-ups in the party will agree is another matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is crucial for the future of climate&nbsp;change and environmental policy. Since the premiership of Margaret Thatcher - a chemist by training who spoke out on the need to tackle climate&nbsp;change in 1988 - green issues have largely enjoyed a cross-party consensus in the UK, in contrast to the US. But the current coalition has been heavily criticised by green groups who say it has failed to fulfil Cameron's promise to be the &quot;greenest government ever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That impression was reinforced by the departure of Greg Barker, the last remaining prominent green Tory in government, from the role of minister of state for energy and climate&nbsp;change. In opposition he was instrumental in promoting Cameron as a green politician, accompanying him on tireless rounds of visits to green groups and helping to orchestrate the &quot;hug a huskie&quot; trip to Greenland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His departure is the latest in a line of blows to green Toryism, abetted by the chancellor's outspoken remarks branding green regulations a burden on British businesses that he would like to see cut. &quot;There is a strong streak of climate scepticism among the newer MPs,&quot; one Conservative politician said, backed up by several others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several prominent green Tories have been forced out of their jobs in recent months. This year Tim Yeo, former Conservative minister and a scourge of government climate policies, was deselected by his constituency party. So too was Ann McIntosh, chair of the committee on environment and rural affairs. Laura Sandys, another thoughtful green voice, stepped down, to the dismay of campaigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green businesses are increasingly worried. Paul King, chief executive of the Green Building Council, said: &quot;It's deeply worrying. We've seen [green Tories] falling, and the new MPs are not showing much willingness on these issues. But the public are not anti-green.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there have been counter-signs, too. The climate sceptic Owen Paterson was ousted as environment secretary, to the delight of green campaigners. His replacement, Liz Truss, won plaudits in her former role in education but has said little publicly on the environment to date. Neither have the two new junior appointments to the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change, Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd. &quot;We just don't know what they stand for,&quot; said one Whitehall insider, a complaint repeated several times to the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moderate politicians and observers think the coalition will continue to find the centre ground. &quot;Environmental issues are part of the centre ground of British politics,&quot; said Guy Shrubsole, of Friends of the Earth. &quot;That has been so in the UK since Margaret Thatcher. We are not like the US or Australia - this is a different situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news from the US may discourage those who want to make this a dividing line. &quot;Climate&nbsp;change denial by America's Republicans has undermined the best policy outcomes for a generation, making the fight against climate less effective, more expensive, and unnecessarily rancorous,&quot; said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate&nbsp;change aide. &quot;But recent polling shows the issue is becoming a political embarrassment and millstone for the Republican party, even as they have yet to change their stripes. It's hard to see why any party around the world would emulate such nihilism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will have a fight on their hands,&quot; warned Shrubsole of those who want to change UK politics against environmental action. Green organisations - who, if conservation groups such as the National Trust are included, boast a combined membership of millions, far outstripping any political party - are gearing up for that fight. &quot;People in this country do care about nature,&quot; said Gareth Morgan, of the RSPB. &quot;It's up to us NGOs to show politicians that. It is not a trade-off between protecting nature or the economy - we can have both together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says he remembers the morning he spotted a well-known colleague at a gathering of climate experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I walked over and held out my hand to greet him,'' Dr. Christy recalled. ''He looked me in the eye, and he said, 'No.' I said, 'Come on, shake hands with me.' And he said, 'No.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy is an outlier on what the vast majority of his colleagues consider to be a matter of consensus: that global warming is both settled science and a dire threat. He regards it as neither. Not that the earth is not heating up. It is, he says, and carbon dioxide spewed from power plants, automobiles and other sources is at least partly responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in speeches, congressional testimony and peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals, he argues that predictions of future warming have been greatly overstated and that humans have weathered warmer stretches without perishing. Dr. Christy's willingness to publicize his views, often strongly, has also hurt his standing among scientists who tend to be suspicious of those with high profiles. His frequent appearances on Capitol Hill have almost always been at the request of Republican legislators opposed to addressing climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I detest words like 'contrarian' and 'denier,' '' he said. ''I'm a data-driven climate scientist. Every time I hear that phrase, 'The science is settled,' I say I can easily demonstrate that that is false, because this is the climate -- right here. The science is not settled.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy was pointing to a chart comparing seven computer projections of global atmospheric temperatures based on measurements taken by satellites and weather balloons. The projections traced a sharp upward slope; the actual measurements, however, ticked up only slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such charts -- there are others, sometimes less dramatic but more or less accepted by the large majority of climate scientists -- are the essence of the divide between that group on one side and Dr. Christy and a handful of other respected scientists on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Almost anyone would say the temperature rise seen over the last 35 years is less than the latest round of models suggests should have happened,'' said Carl Mears, the senior research scientist at Remote Sensing Systems, a California firm that analyzes satellite climate readings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Where the disagreement comes is that Dr. Christy says the climate models are worthless and that there must be something wrong with the basic model, whereas there are actually a lot of other possibilities,'' Dr. Mears said. Among them, he said, are natural variations in the climate and rising trade winds that have helped funnel atmospheric heat into the ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy has drawn the scorn of his colleagues partly because they believe that so much is at stake and that he is providing legitimacy to those who refuse to acknowledge that. If the models are imprecise, they argue, the science behind them is compelling, and it is very likely that the world has only a few decades to stave off potentially catastrophic warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if he is wrong, there is no redo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's kind of like telling a little girl who's trying to run across a busy street to catch a school bus to go for it, knowing there's a substantial chance that she'll be killed,'' said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''She might make it. But it's a big gamble to take.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Dr. Christy argues that reining in carbon emissions is both futile and unnecessary, and that money is better spent adapting to what he says will be moderately higher temperatures. Among other initiatives, he said, the authorities could limit development in coastal and hurricane-prone areas, expand flood plains, make manufactured housing more resistant to tornadoes and high winds, and make farms in arid regions less dependent on imported water -- or move production to rainier places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy's scenario is not completely out of the realm of possibility, his critics say, but it is highly unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews, prominent scientists, while disagreeing with Dr. Christy, took pains to acknowledge his credentials. They are substantial: Dr. Christy, 63, has researched climate issues for 27 years and was a lead author -- in essence, an editor -- of a section of the 2001 report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, the definitive assessment of the state of global warming. With a colleague at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Dr. Roy Spencer, he received NASA's medal for exceptional scientific achievement in 1991 for building a global temperature database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That model, which concluded that a layer of the atmosphere was unexpectedly cooling, was revised to show slight warming after other scientists documented flaws in its methodology. It has become something of a scientific tit for tat. Dr. Christy and Dr. Spencer's own recalculations scaled back the amount of warming, leading to further assaults on their methodology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy's response sits on his bookshelf: a thick stack of yellowed paper with the daily weather data he began recording in Fresno, Calif., in the 1960s. It was his first data set, he said, the foundation of a conviction that ''you have to know what's happening before you know why it's happening, and that comes back to data.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy says he became fascinated with weather as a fifth grader when a snowstorm hit Fresno in 1961. By his high school junior year, he had taught himself Fortran, the first widely used programming language, and had programmed a school computer to make weather predictions. After earning a degree in mathematics at California State University, Fresno, he became an evangelical Christian missionary in Kenya, married and returned as pastor of a mission church in South Dakota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, as a part-time college math teacher, he found his true calling. He left the pastoral position, earned a doctorate in atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois and moved to Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while his work has been widely published, he has often been vilified by his peers. Dr. Christy is mentioned, usually critically, in dozens of the so-called Climategate emails that were hacked from the computers of the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Center, the British keeper of global temperature records, in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''John Christy has made a scientific career out of being wrong,'' one prominent climate scientist, Benjamin D. Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, wrote in one 2008 email. ''He's not even a third-rate scientist.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another email included a photographic collage showing Dr. Christy and other scientists who question the extent of global warming, some stranded on a tiny ice floe labeled ''North Pole'' and others buoyed in the sea by a life jacket and a yellow rubber ducky. A cartoon balloon depicts three of them saying, ''Global warming is a hoax.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, including those who disagree with Dr. Christy, are dismayed by the treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Show me two scientists who agree on everything,'' said Peter Thorne, a senior researcher at Norway's Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center who wrote a 2005 research article on climate&nbsp;change with Dr. Christy. ''We may disagree over what we are finding, but we should be playing the ball and not the man.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Christy has been dismissed in environmental circles as a pawn of the fossil-fuel industry who distorts science to fit his own ideology. (''I don't take money from industries,'' he said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he worries that his climate stances are affecting his chances of publishing future research and winning grants. The largest of them, a four-year Department of Energy stipend to investigate discrepancies between climate models and real-world data, expires in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's a climate establishment,'' Dr. Christy said. ''And I'm not in it.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;There's no escaping Lord Lawson at the moment - which rather debunks his claim that climate-change sceptics can't get a hearing. He's been telling anyone who will listen that he has been banned by the BBC. He hasn't. It has merely concluded, as first revealed here, that while he challenges the view of scientists, he should not himself be placed on an equal footing with scientists. Which is fair.

But of course it's always hard to row back from anything you've made a big splash about.&quot; As for climate change, he wishes we would all pipe down about it. &quot;It's a new religion. That is why it is so difficult to change people's minds - because they are not interested in the facts, it's a belief system.&quot; More reason not to confuse him with anyone who has a grasp of the science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;The BBC was right to pronounce. It's what they do well. And in the absence of grand and ancient givers of wisdom, we have Baron Hall of Birkenhead, the director general of the Beeb.

No chance for the hoi polloi to question the great man. This reminded many of those gathered of the great philosopher of freedom, Karl Popper. Whenever a student at the LSE in the 70s ventured a query, they were firmly rebuffed by a flunky who would declare: &quot;Sir Karl does not take questions!&quot; Lord Hall might add such a factotum to the staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Though London has a noble history of sheltering Frenchmen escaping revolutionary fervour, there must be limits.

But if you are a fish or a crab, a degree or two makes the difference to whether a stretch of sea suits your lifestyle and breeding success.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the land surface, where weather changes each day mask climate&nbsp;change, water temperatures rise slowly but steadily.

The ratio of warm water species has increased, but in total, biodiversity has dropped, so some animals have disappeared altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crabs in particular have been racing north to grab new territory. One that might be found on British beaches this summer is the tiny hermit crab, Diogenes pugilator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally a native of the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic, it is now found on beaches as far north as the Humber. You will have to look fairly hard though - its maximum size is 5mm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the winter, when the fringes of the North Sea can get cold, these and other crabs retreat to deeper and warmer waters and wait for the spring. But their presence in summer is a sure sign of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crabs in particular have been racing north to grab new territory. One that might be found on British beaches this summer is the tiny hermit crab, Diogenes pugilator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally a native of the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic, it is now found on beaches as far north as the Humber. You will have to look fairly hard though - its maximum size is 5mm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the winter, when the fringes of the North Sea can get cold, these and other crabs retreat to deeper and warmer waters and wait for the spring. But their presence in summer is a sure sign of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOBART, Tasmania -- The young Australian vintner Nick Glaetzer's winemaking-steeped family thought he was crazy when he abandoned the Barossa Valley -- the hot, dry region that is home to the country's world-famous big, brassy shiraz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trampling over the family's century-old grape-growing roots on the Australian mainland, Mr. Glaetzer headed south to the tiny island state of Tasmania to strike out on his own and prove to the naysayers there was a successful future in cooler-climate wines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just five years later, Mr. Glaetzer's Glaetzer-Dixon Mon Pere Shiraz had won a major national award -- the first time judges had handed the coveted trophy to a shiraz made south of the Bass Strait separating Tasmania from the Australian mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Glaetzer's gamble embodies a major shift in Australia's wine-growing industry as it responds to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States found that as much as 73 percent of Australian land used for viticulture could become unsuitable by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the country's traditional wine-growing regions, including the Barossa, the Hunter Valley and Margaret River, grow ever hotter and drier, winemakers are rushing to Tasmania. Average summer temperatures there are about 38 percent cooler than in the Barossa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temperatures in Australia's main wine regions are projected to increase between 0.3 and 1.7 degrees Celsius, or half a degree to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, by 2030, according to the Australian national science agency. The hotter temperatures would reduce grape quality 12 to 57 percent, the agency's modeling shows. But in cooler Tasmania, warmer weather could be a benefit because current temperatures can get too chilly for some grape varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winemakers are so concerned about the impact of global warming on the industry -- which is worth 5.7 billion Australian dollars, or nearly $5.4 billion -- that they paid for a government-backed experiment in the Barossa vineyards to simulate the drier conditions expected in 30 to 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For wine lovers, the upshot is that Australia's shiraz is already changing -- Mr. Glaetzer's version is 15 to 20 percent lower in alcohol content than its Barossa cousins -- and could be unrecognizable in half a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the projections are right, a shiraz in the Barossa in 50 years' time may well taste totally different to what it does at the moment,'' said Michael McCarthy, the government scientist leading the Barossa experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flight south comes as Australia's wine industry emerges from a disastrous few decades, blighted by a high Australian dollar and a grape glut that reduced exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the national wine industry has shrunk 1.9 percent annually from 2009 to 2014, the Tasmanian state industry is growing at a rate of close to 10 percent a year, according to the Tasmanian Climate&nbsp;Change Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's one of the cooler areas in Australia to grow grapes, and if we are going to have climate&nbsp;change, you might as well start in a cooler climate,'' said Cecil Camilleri, the manager of sustainable wine programs at Yalumba, the 165-year-old winemaking company that has snapped up three Tasmanian properties in the past 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury Wine Estates, one of the world's largest wine companies, purchased White Hills vineyard in Tasmania last year. The move was a geographical hedge as well as part of its strategy of owning or controlling vineyards that supply grapes suited to its luxury wine portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has sold its vineyards in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, citing its concern that the region will become ''hot and dry and expensive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barossa winemakers, meanwhile, are not sitting back waiting for their vines to wither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yalumba is enforcing a change in the irrigation technology used by its growers, from systems that water large areas to microsystems that target specific areas, ensuring each drop of water counts. It is also encouraging growers to graft wine varieties that have drought-resistant characteristics to rootstocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's a lot of season-to-season adaptation happening right now, because climate&nbsp;change is happening now,'' Mr. Camilleri said. ''It's happening incrementally and we are adapting incrementally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-backed ''winter drought project,'' throwing tarpaulins over rows of vines, is designed to simulate reduced rainfall of 15 to 20 percent that the region is projected to experience in 2030-50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experiment is investigating whether drip irrigation, which wets only a small portion of vine roots, will be enough to supplement natural rainfall, which wets the entire root.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to vintners' troubles, the rise in temperatures means a greater proportion of fruit is ripening in a shorter period, resulting in a compressed harvest period that is putting pressure on vineyard facilities and management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Petrie, national viticulturalist at Treasury Wine Estates, said his company was looking for ways to ''put harvests back into a more reasonable time frame.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone shares the concern. Australia's Conservative-led coalition government is playing down the effect of climate&nbsp;change on Australian agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since taking leadership of the country last September, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who in 2009 said the science behind climate&nbsp;change was ''crap,'' has abolished the independent Climate Commission, the body created by the former Labor government to provide public information on the effects of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott has also introduced legislation into Parliament to eliminate Labor's Climate&nbsp;Change Authority, which advises the government on emissions-reduction targets, and to repeal its tax on carbon pricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abbott dismissed climate&nbsp;change as a factor when unveiling a 320-million-dollar short-term drought relief package for farmers this year: ''If you look at the records of Australian agriculture going back 150 years, there have always been good times and bad, tough and lush times. This is not a new thing in Australia.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Climate Commission had warned in its 2011 Critical Decade report that wine grapes and other temperature-and water-sensitive crops needed to adapt to climate&nbsp;change ''or move to locations where growing conditions are more amenable to their production.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A top Chinese official says the country may announce a peak year for climate-warming emissions soon. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With climate treaty negotiations expected to intensify next year, China is signaling that it may soon set the timetable for hitting an eventual peak in its emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important human-generated greenhouse gas. The signals came on Monday from Xie Zhenhua, China's lead climate treaty negotiator, speaking at a German climate conference. Here's coverage by Xinhua, China's government-echoing &quot;news&quot; agency:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China might announce a &quot;peaking year&quot; for its carbon emissions in the first half of 2015 when the country would present its contributions to address global climate&nbsp;change, said China's chief climate negotiator on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China was trying to present its &quot;national determined contributions&quot; in the first half of next year. Among the contributions, &quot;the peaking year might be included,&quot; Xie Zhenhua, deputy chief of the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters during an informal ministerial conference in Berlin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual conference, known as Petersberg Climate Dialogue [ link ], was organized by the German federal government and attended by some 35 ministers this year. [Read the rest.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's interesting to note that the website Responding to Climate&nbsp;Change, also posting from the meeting, used the word &quot;capping&quot; where Xinhua used &quot;peaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A peak (as in &quot;peak travel&quot;) can be reached without a binding cap, and the difference is not merely semantic, especially in the endless climate standoff between the United States and China over who goes first, and when. (My bet is that peak is more accurate; I'd love to hear from any Chinese speakers who were there or have access to the transcript.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is great to see China continuing to pursue policies that cut emissions of greenhouse gases per unit of economic output. But it's also important not to over-inflate expectations about what its leaders are willing to do given that sustaining the growth of China's middle class remains a top priority. At the Berlin meeting, Xie stressed that China still sees itself as a developing nation, with different obligations on greenhouse gases to those of developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statements by Xie, who has led China's delegation in climate negotiations for many years, carry far more weight than those of government advisers, whose comments about a cap coming in the country's next five-year plan were wishfully spun in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's encouraging to see many countries, and outside analysts, focusing on strategies for accelerating a shift toward ending emissions growth that move away from the failed idea of a binding global cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in sync with the invaluable &quot;Blueprint to End Paralysis Over Global Action on Climate&quot; written by former senators Tim Wirth and Tom Daschle for Yale Environment 360. I wish more climate campaigners would read that piece.                      </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As politicians argue over the science of climate change, others are starting to talk about its emotional impact. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2100, I will live in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me backtrack: Unless longevity research makes some big strides in the next few decades, I'll probably be dead by 2100. Nor do I have any plans to retire to Palm Beach in my late 110s. But if I somehow survive, and if I stay in New York City, my experience will be Floridian: According to an interactive&nbsp;map&nbsp;created by Climate Central, a Manhattan summer at the end of this century will feel like a summer in Lehigh Acres, about 90 miles south of Sarasota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what if in my extreme old age I decide to return to the city of my childhood, Los Angeles? As it turns out, Los Angeles in 2100 will feel like the Florida city of Fountainbleau. According to Climate Central at least, global warming is slowly turning all the places I have ever loved into Florida.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The metaphor of physical displacement feels like an apt one for what appears to be happening to our weather: The places we live are not what they once were. While politicians debate the existence of climate&nbsp;change (or, increasingly, move on to debating whether to do anything about it), other narratives are just starting to get attention: Those that deal with how it feels when what we once relied on - the length of the winter, say, or the depth of a river - seems to shift around us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a May story for The Globe and Mail, Gayle MacDonald quotes Sammy McLean, a 14-year-old girl whose Calgary home was damaged by a recent flood:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to think the rivers were so pretty. It made me not like them any more. I thought the water was going to take away the whole house - and my bedroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. MacDonald also talks to Chris Saade, a therapist who has treated kids anxious about climate&nbsp;change. He says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tell them grief is a normal response of the human psyche when a loss is happening, whether it's personal or, in this case, a global loss in terms of the environment. If we don't feel grief, at the end of the day, we won't do anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, too, are beginning to ask how grief affects our response to the climate. Katherine M. Preston, a preacher and writer, addresses these issues in an essay at Utne Reader:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We rarely talk about loss, grief, and climate&nbsp;change. The losses come in many forms. Clearly the victims of weather-related events, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, grieve deeply when faced with the immediate losses of homes and neighborhoods. People drawing their livelihoods from the land and sea notice changes that will eventually eliminate that way of life for them, at least in that place. Some of us may have chosen changes in lifestyles to reduce our carbon footprint; it is something we do out of love, but there can still be accompanying feelings of loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She fears that these feelings may be immobilizing for some and calls upon readers to &quot;adapt to an environment in which our traditional relationship with the Earth has been replaced with a new one. Everything must change, from how we dry our clothes to the underlying assumptions about our economy.&quot; She asks, &quot;Instead of guilt, fear, and depression, can we face our profound loss, talk about it, acknowledge our grief, and move forward within this new community?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Preston also cites Steve Running, an ecology professor who delivered a popular talk called&nbsp;&quot;The Five Stages of Climate Grief&quot; in 2007. Channeling Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross, he argued that policy makers needed to move beyond the stages of denial and depression into something more productive:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really need most of our political, business and intellectual leaders to reach Stage 5 ACCEPTANCE in order to move forward, as a nation, and as a global citizenry. There is no guarantee that we can successfully stop global warming, but doing nothing given our present knowledge is unconscionable. How otherwise can we look into our grandchildren's eyes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others may prefer to grieve without necessarily trying to fix the problem. In The New York Times Magazine in April, Daniel Smith profiled Paul Kingsnorth, the author of a manifesto called &quot;Uncivilization&quot; and a critic of the idea that technological solutions can reverse the effects of climate&nbsp;change. Mr. Smith wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kingsnorth would agree with the need for grief but not with the idea that it must lead to change - at least not the kind of change that mainstream environmental groups pursue. 'What do you do,' he asked, 'when you accept that all of these changes are coming, things that you value are going to be lost, things that make you unhappy are going to happen, things that you wanted to achieve you can't achieve, but you still have to live with it, and there's still beauty, and there's still meaning, and there are still things you can do to make the world less bad? And that's not a series of questions that have any answers other than people's personal answers to them. Selfishly it's just a process I'm going through.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Zadie Smith, in an essay at The New York Review of Books, imagines what she might tell her (at this point, notional) granddaughter in 2050 about climate&nbsp;change and how we felt about it in 2014:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to remember that the necessary conditions of our lives - those things that seem to us unavoidably to be the case - are not only debated by physicists and philosophers but exist, irrationally, in the minds of the rest of us, beneath contempt intellectually, perhaps, but we still experience them as permanent facts. The climate was one of those facts. We did not think it could change. That is, we always knew we could do a great deal of damage to this planet, but even the most hubristic among us had not imagined we would ever be able to fundamentally change its rhythms and character, just as a child who has screamed all day at her father still does not expect to see him lie down on the kitchen floor and weep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Smith sees our emotions as both an impediment and a goad to action. On the one hand, we may be a little bit attached to end-of-the-world narratives, as long as they're vague enough.&nbsp;On the other, changes in the things we thought could never change may propel us through sorrow to solution. She imagines telling her young descendant:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the end, the only thing that could create the necessary traction in our minds was the intimate loss of the things we loved. Like when the seasons changed in our beloved little island, or when the lights went out on the fifteenth floor, or the day I went into an Italian garden in early July, with its owner, a woman in her eighties, and upon seeing the scorched yellow earth and withered roses, and hearing what only the really old people will confess -&nbsp;in all my years I've never seen anything like it&nbsp;- I found my mind finally beginning to turn from the elegiac&nbsp;what have we done&nbsp;to the practical&nbsp;what can we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I somehow live until 2100 I'll have time not just for granddaughters but for great-great-granddaughters. Maybe by then all of us, living in our various Floridas, will have sorted out our feelings and determined what, if anything, we can do with them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the next band of guest editors take charge of Radio 4's Today, there will be a new edict from the programme's editor, Jamie Angus: leave Thought for the Day alone. This follows singer PJ Harvey's controversial editorship of the programme in January, which featured an &quot;alternative&quot; Thought for the Day by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and an attempt by another guest editor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the worldwide web, to have an atheist do the three-minute talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angus describes the slot, which began in 1970 (following various religious programmes since 1939), as sacrosanct. &quot;The only ground rule I am going to set is you can't mess around with Thought for the Day,&quot; he says. &quot;People need to be clear you can't use the guest editorship as a lever to do a secular Thought for the Day or a backdoor way to open up a Thought for the Day debate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC has reviewed the mini-sermon at various times in its history, including five years ago when the BBC Trust rejected calls to feature non-religious speakers. Angus, who describes himself as a &quot;big fan&quot;, says: &quot;One of the great things about living in Britain is that we are a pluralist society that is immensely tolerant of a wide range of different religions. I think Thought for the Day is one of the hidden pillars that absolutely supports that architecture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Lib Dem researcher and press officer before joining the BBC, he admits he &quot;wasn't particularly comfortable&quot; about elements of the PJ Harvey edition which included a contribution by campaigning journalist John Pilger. &quot;Some of it was really on the edge of what we could do but it was a really interesting programme and prompted a huge amount of response,&quot; adds Angus. &quot;I was uneasy about the unchallenged nature of both Assange and the John Pilger essay. On the following day we did a contra-Pilger item, talking about the Iraqi death toll, which he didn't like very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first interview since taking charge of Today in September last year, Angus says he has sought to expand the programme's &quot;editorial palette&quot; while remaining true to its traditions. As well as appointing a dedicated sports producer - &quot;too often we have ghettoised sport into the sports desk (hourly bulletin)&quot; - he has looked to embrace &quot;the more poppy end of culture - it needs to get a really good showing on the programme, not just high-end theatre and a bit of opera. Popular music, TV box sets, tablets, the internet, all these things are totally mainstream for the Today audience&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the programme can err, says Angus, is an occasional reticence by presenters to engage with such topics and a tendency to present them in &quot;inverted commas&quot;. &quot;Sometimes people fall into the habit of jokily saying, 'of course I don't know anything about this stuff'. I don't like that, I think it puts up a barrier for new audiences.&quot; But he admits there will be a &quot;small minority of the Today audience who never want to hear any sport or a single beat of pop music on the programme ever. I can't deliver that for them, I'm afraid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clearest change has been the arrival of Mishal Husain last year, putting an end to criticism that only one of its rota of presenters, Sarah Montague, was a woman. Angus already knew Husain from BBC World News, where the pair worked together on its coverage of the royal wedding in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wouldn't be surprising to say the question of who the next female presenter of Today should be came up as part of the process to get the job,&quot; he says. &quot;Mishal was at the top of the list of people I wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say the lack of female voices on Today is still a problem. &quot;It's an incredibly difficult area and we are making a real effort to improve and I do genuinely think we have improved enormously,&quot; says Angus. &quot;It's the nature of news that sometimes you end up with big blocks of male guests and you happen to have two male presenters, and suddenly the show sounds very male. We should never be in a position editorially where we change a guest or a story primarily on the basis of the gender of the guest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Husain's arrival inevitably raised the question - which incumbent presenter would she replace? As it turned out, no one. James Naughtie, who spends part of the week on Good Morning Scotland in the run-up to September's independence referendum, will return full-time at the end of the year, part of a six-strong team alongside Husain, Montague, Evan Davis, Justin Webb and John Humphrys, filling 12 presenter slots a week. It feels like an anomaly at a time when BBC News will cut up to 600 jobs as part of a further imminent cost-cutting drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not anticipating further changes,&quot; says Angus, who expects the current line-up to remain &quot;at least through to the end of next year&quot;. &quot;We have got enough work for six presenters,&quot; he adds. &quot;It goes wider than just presenting, they do quite a lot of reporting and with the referendum and general election next year I have got more demands than ever for presenters to be on the road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humphrys, 70, is the &quot;most recognisable and important interviewer and presenter we have in this country&quot;, says Angus. But he won't be appearing in a new TV marketing campaign for Today featuring Husain and Davis and aimed squarely at Radio 4's so-called &quot;replenisher&quot; audience - aged 35 to 54 - who spend less time listening to Today than they used to. Overall audience figures are healthy at over 7 million listeners a week, with an average age of 57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have a demographic time bomb under Today but younger audiences are listening for a shorter number of hours,&quot; says Angus. &quot;I am interested in how we keep people listening.&quot; He wants to do more with digital and reach younger listeners on social media with &quot;(Jeremy) Vine-style six second bits of eclectic Today experience&quot;. Evan Davis' dog, Mr Whippy, attempting to predict England's World Cup results was an early, if not entirely inspiring, example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former editor of the World at One, Angus took over Today after a year on BBC2's Newsnight, where he was parachuted in after the Savile crisis, joining three days after its calamitous Lord McAlpine report. After eight months as Newsnight's acting editor, he applied for the job full-time, but lost out to Ian Katz, former deputy editor of the Guardian. &quot;I felt strongly about lots of things (on Newsnight) and wanted to have my say,&quot; says Angus. &quot;I think it is fair to say I am very pleased to have got this job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day we meet, another Today controversy is playing out following reports that the BBC's editorial complaints unit will uphold a complaint about a debate broadcast in February featuring prominent climate change sceptic, Lord Lawson. Angus defends his decision to invite Lawson. &quot;The BBC can't say, 'we aren't going to put that point of view on air because scientists tell us it's not right',&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People always raise flat earth at this point, but if you go into a pub on Oxford Street you won't find anyone who says the earth is flat, but you will probably find a couple of people who are unconvinced by the science on climate change. Clearly the BBC has to reflect what is a relatively settled view of the majority of scientists . . . but absolutely should not squeeze out alternative points of view, and we haven't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Murphy: Britain has steered groundbreaking deals before. It must do so again, setting radical goals to save as many lives as possible</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's buck the doom and gloom of the nightly news bulletins for a minute and kick off with some cheer. According to the Gates Foundation, the world is - by almost any measure - better than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may sound counterintuitive when so many people are struggling at home, but extreme poverty around the world has halved since 1990, a record number of girls attend school, and diseases that once wiped out entire communities are in retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is partly thanks to the internationally agreed millennium development goals. Although they did not get everything right, the MDGs set clear and concise targets. From eradicating poverty and boosting education to tackling disease and mother-and-infant mortality, the goals helped focus minds and funding on core, achievable aims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International representatives will gather in New York on Monday to finalise their proposals for global development for the next 15 years. Or, as the UN puts it, the 13th session of the open working group on sustainable development goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it is not quite as simple or as powerful as the Make Poverty History campaigns. No wonder the process is yet to capture the world's imagination. But make no mistake, this is a real opportunity to change our planet for the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the correct goals, we can wipe out extreme poverty, secure health coverage at all ages and begin to reverse climate&nbsp;change. That is a thrilling prospect - which is why these negotiations need an urgent injection of radical ambition led by the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the British government is not doing enough to push things forward. Negotiations on development are a very real example of how the isolation this country is falling into - which so delights the Tory back benches - is not just bad for Britain, but bad for all those who hope for an equitable world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Labour was in power, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown used hard-won political capital to convince and to cajole other rich states into playing their part. David Cameron and his government must get off the sidelines and do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the negotiations this week, there are three things this government should push for. First, the UK should lead calls to place the battle against climate&nbsp;change at the heart of any new agreement. It should push for a commitment to keep the global rise in temperature below 2C to become top priority, as well as retaining pledges on environmental sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate is the central development issue of the next century. If we fail to tackle the changes in our environment, all the gains we make elsewhere - from health and poverty to food and sanitation - will be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the UK should use its status as the home of the NHS and a world leader in public health to demand a headline commitment on universal coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the party that founded the NHS, healthcare for all is central to Labour's beliefs. There is convincing evidence that universal health coverage leads to better outcomes, reduces inequality and helps prevent 100 million people a year from descending into poverty. That is why we want to see universal health coverage included at goal level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On poverty, the UK should extend further than a simple plan to eliminate the risk of anyone having to survive on just $1.25 (73p) a day. It should raise the bar and call for an ambitious new target of $2. The new goals are scheduled to expire in 2030, but today, more than 1 billion people live on $1-2 a day. We cannot simply overlook that level of poverty for the next 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the next development targets must focus on more than climate&nbsp;change, poverty and universal healthcare, but we think that is a good place to focus our efforts. In addition, the goals must address inequalities in gender and education, resource scarcity, disease and hunger, sanitation, governance and the rule of law. And they must maintain respect for, and recognition of, human rights and much else besides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has a robust record on development. We have helped steer the world to groundbreaking agreements - the time has come for Britain to do so again. There is no time to lose - there are millions of lives to save.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several poor summers for Scotland's puffins, the &quot;clowns of the sea&quot; are gearing up to leave the country after a good breeding season, experts have said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes to habitat and food brought on by climate&nbsp;change have created difficult conditions for breeding puffins in recent years, but early indications show that Scotland has enjoyed a positive breeding season, according to the Scottish Seabird Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With pufflings now hatched and ready to take wing, visitors to Scotland have only a few weeks left before the birds - who come to Scottish islands including May, Craigleith, Fidre and Shetland - leave Britain's northern shores in August, said the chief executive, Tom Brock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brightly beaked birds - which stay with the same breeding partner for life and return year upon year to the same nests - arrive in Scotland from mid-March to breed. After mating the female puffin lays one egg which is incubated by both the male and female. Pufflings are strong enough to leave the burrow after four or five weeks, and will take flight with the rest of their colony in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like it has been a good breeding season for puffins,&quot; said Brock. &quot;They have had lots of problems in the last few years with climate&nbsp;change, lack of food and winter storms but early indications are that it's going to be a good breeding season for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, the European Union, China and 11 other governments began trade negotiations this week to eliminate tariffs on solar panels, wind turbines, water-treatment equipment and other environmental goods. If they are able to reach an agreement, it could reduce the cost of equipment needed to address climate&nbsp;change and help increase American exports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global trade in environmental goods is estimated at $1 trillion a year and has been growing fast. (The United States exported about $106 billion worth of such goods last year.) But some countries have imposed import duties as high as 35 percent on such goods. That raises the already high cost of some of this equipment to utilities, manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, the countries represented in these talks (the 28 members of the E.U. negotiate jointly, while China and Hong Kong are represented by separate delegations) account for about 86 percent of trade in these products, which makes the potential benefit from an agreement substantial. Other big countries that are not taking part in these talks, like India, South Africa and Brazil, could choose to join later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's decision to take part is important because it has put up trade barriers that have made it hard for American businesses to offer renewable energy equipment in the Chinese market. These talks could help remove those protectionist policies, which, among other things, require foreign companies to set up local joint ventures if they want to sell equipment in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process won't be easy. The negotiators have to first determine what specific goods will be included in the agreement. They are starting from a list of 54 products identified by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, but they are expected to expand that list considerably. Officials will also have to determine how quickly to phase out tariffs and other barriers to trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World leaders will have to use many tools to deal with climate&nbsp;change. Eliminating tariffs on environmental goods could help.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Republicans promote the state's economic ''miracle,'' many climate scientists from Texas say prosperity has come at a steep price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its dependence on an energy industry that relies on extracting fossil fuels, scientists say Texas has become a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions as well as more vulnerable to its consequences. Texas emits more greenhouse gases than any other state, according to federal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Republican leaders, however, have questioned whether the earth is warming and that humans are responsible. Even if the science is true, officials say, Texas can do nothing meaningful without hurting its economy. Reducing emissions will drive up electricity prices and eliminate jobs, they argue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many scientists disagree, saying that Texas is missing an opportunity to be a leader in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that state agencies cannot continue to ignore the effects of climate&nbsp;change on water resources and coastal development, especially because they are already here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Texas is really at the forefront of this problem,'' said Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University scientist who studies the effects of climate&nbsp;change on regions across the country and says the state is among the most vulnerable to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher temperatures have exacerbated the multiyear drought by causing more evaporation from reservoirs, reducing stream flows and diminishing rainfall's ability to revive dry soil, according to water planning officials and scientists across the state. And sea levels on portions of Texas' Gulf Coast have already risen as much as two feet in the last century, which scientists attribute partly to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say Texas officials have not asked them for climate projection data or done any comprehensive studies on how global warming is affecting the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I call Texas a 'state of denial,' '' said John Anderson, a professor of oceanography at Rice University and a global expert on sea levels. ''And that denial is becoming less tolerable as time goes along.'' He said that the rate of sea-level rise on the Gulf Coast was six times higher today than it was a century ago and would only continue to increase, but that state officials were not planning for such a scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State regulators have expressed skepticism about global warming. Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott, the Republican candidate for governor, have refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and have sued the Obama administration over its major climate&nbsp;change initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The governor has made his position on climate&nbsp;change clear, particularly that we should not be sacrificing economic opportunity for Texas families through onerous regulations based on unsettled science,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, Lucy Nashed, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce McCarl, an agricultural economist at Texas A&amp;M University and a member of the climate&nbsp;change panel that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has predicted that some crop production would move out of Texas altogether because of excessive heat and a lack of water. (Rice and Texas A&amp;M are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think Texas is quite vulnerable in terms of agriculture and water,'' Dr. McCarl said. ''We're probably the most affected state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon of Texas A&amp;M, projects that global warming will reduce Texas' water supply by as much as 15 percent in the coming decades. But state agencies have not consulted with him on such climate&nbsp;change data, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Given that climate&nbsp;change has been politicized across the board , it doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon, who was appointed by Gov. George W. Bush in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Clawson, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said that the agency looked broadly at research from across the globe, but ''we do not cede our responsibility to evaluate scientific documents to selected researchers or research institutions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas leaders have not always been so resistant to climate science. More than 20 years ago, lawmakers gave the state the power to address ''climatic changes, including global warming,'' though the statute received little attention at the time and has never been acted on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 2000, bolstered by Mr. Bush's presidential campaign pledge to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, environmental groups persuaded the Texas commission to look into greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting report recommended that the state expand ''pollution prevention incentive programs to include CO2 and other greenhouse gases.'' But the report never became a final draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic surfaced again in 2009, when Republican state senators, including Troy Fraser and Kip Averitt, discussed legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support climate&nbsp;change research. But their proposals did not become law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a disagreement within the people of Texas on the science of greenhouse gases,'' said Mr. Fraser, who is now chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. ''We have moved forward with the things that are free-enterprise issues, like wind, like solar.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Averitt, now a health and environmental consultant, said the tone of the climate&nbsp;change debate had radically shifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Unfortunately, climate&nbsp;change is associated with a liberal agenda that most Republicans are initially going to reject,'' he said. ''Quite frankly, it was that simple and nonconstructive. You do your rhetoric, we're going to do our rhetoric, and in the meantime nothing gets done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas' economic and energy boom is likely another reason Republicans have strayed from climate science -- the state's economy runs largely on the ability to emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases and to export fossil fuels around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Larry Soward, a former close political associate of Mr. Perry's, the easy narrative of Texas' ascent fueled by business-friendly conservatism was too good to pass up for Mr. Perry as he prepared to run for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When he made his run in the presidential race, he was totally negative towards environmental issues like greenhouse gases and climate&nbsp;change, and I think that was strictly because of the partisan politics necessary to get support,'' said Mr. Soward, whom Mr. Perry appointed to serve on the Texas commission from 2003 to 2007 and is now an environmental activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Nashed, Mr. Perry's spokeswoman, said the governor was committed to protecting the environment by reducing other ''known pollutants'' like nitrogen oxide but did not believe that greenhouse gases fell in the same category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas has spent more than $350,000 suing the federal Environmental Protection Agency over the regulation of greenhouse gases since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, according to the attorney general's office, but has yet to win a case. The Supreme Court in June largely struck down the state's most recent attempt, and declined to hear appeals of two other cases that Texas lost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Rethinking the Wild,'' by Christopher Solomon (Sunday Review, July 6), raised important issues about wilderness and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilderness can play a significant role in addressing the climate crisis. With climate&nbsp;change coming fast, and with so much uncertainty, we need to experiment with different approaches to see what works best for helping nature adapt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with any experiment, we need a scientific control to see which does better -- nature on its own, or with intervention. While on most public lands we can be more hands-on in helping places cope with climate&nbsp;change, we also need control areas that are hands-off, and wilderness generally fits that bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designated wilderness is also an important strategy to protect drinking water, guard against flooding, and preserve large, connected wildlife areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to helping us study and respond to the climate crisis, wilderness is critical to our quality of life and to our national character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we grapple with the complicated 21st-century issues facing the environment, we should also celebrate what all wild places -- like the Grand Canyon, the Boundary Waters and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- mean to us as a country, and the importance of passing them on to future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAMIE WILLIAMS President, The Wilderness Society Washington, July 8, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wild needs rethinking not just because wildernesses are in such dire straits that we must help them, but because our idea of wilderness does not let us see how to help them without ruining them. The only options we can envision are guarding nature (staying out of it but watching while its destruction is completed) and becoming gardeners of nature (taking an active role in the wild but apparently destroying its wildness).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What needs rethinking is the premise, a residue of a long tradition in Western thought, that a sharp line separates humans and nature. The very phrase ''untrammeled nature'' points to a more complex picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These words are often taken to mean ''untouched nature,'' but in fact to ''trammel'' something is to bind it or restrict its freedom. Nature is trammeled when we harm it or bend it to our own goals, not just when we leave a fingerprint on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gives a different reason for not liking the gardening metaphor. Gardeners can change and rearrange things; they need not be concerned about preserving them. But if we rethink the line between humans and nature, then a third option emerges that combines nature-preservationist goals with nature-participating activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can be not just grieving guards or innovative gardeners but mindful stewards, intervening on behalf of nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Aims of Donor Are Shadowed by Past in Coal'' (front page, July 5):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality of climate change is settled, and we can no longer afford to ignore the facts. If we don't slash carbon pollution now, we will leave our children a climate disaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the dangers of climate change are already being felt across the country and around the world -- particularly among those who can afford it the least -- the importance of individuals willing to take a stand and address these realities cannot be understated. Rather than mocking those with the courage to change -- whether for switching from an S.U.V. to a hybrid, adding solar panels to help power a school, or rethinking how they invest their money in the global economy -- we should regard them as individuals who are taking steps toward a cleaner tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot undo the past, but we can step up and make changes that would improve our children's future. Halting investments in dirty fuels is a key part of this choice -- one that Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund manager featured in your article, and others have already undertaken. Mr. Steyer has come a long way on this issue, as have many Americans. We should stop polluters and their allies from indicting some Americans for not knowing better sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders like Tom Steyer, who rethink and recalibrate their work and lives, set an example worth following.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge of decarbonisation and building a low carbon future is unpicked at our final parliamentary roundtable on energy. Kate Murray reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one thing that everyone involved in the debate over the UK's energy needs can agree on, it's that we need to move faster towards a low carbon future. Not only are there challenging climate&nbsp;change targets to hit, there is also worrying lack of certainty over investment in low carbon technology which could deter investment and hit economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at a recent 'big energy debate' roundtable at Westminster, hosted by the Guardian, tackled the decarbonising challenge head on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest government figures show that just 12% of the UK's energy comes from low carbon sources, while other countries - the leaders in the field - are hitting 41%. Roundtable participants agreed there was much to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Decarbonisation is a really, really big challenge&quot; said the Institution of Engineering and Technology's Simon Harrison. &quot;The pace and the trajectory of change at the moment are rather timid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Smith, head of strategy and policy at the National Grid, said while the shorter-term objectives of meeting the emissions reduction timetable were set, the longer term impact on supply and demand of replacement technology such as electric cars and wind turbines was difficult to predict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is uncertainty,&quot; he said. &quot;It's very hard to form a view of what might happen over the medium and longer term based on what we see today. We need to make sure we are not sleepwalking into the challenges and that we are scoping out the opportunities and understanding what the risks might be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key challenges is making sure the capacity is in place for a low carbon future. &quot;We will need an active network of distribution and to be smarter at managing our existing assets more effectively and building new ones cost effectively,&quot; said Tony Glover, director of policy at the Energy Networks Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advances in carbon capture and storage (CCS) could help significantly reduce emissions from power generation. CCS is often described as the &quot;billion dollar prize&quot; on which the UK could lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Byles MP stressed CCS was particularly important because of the rise in coal use across the world. &quot;It's not just about us doing it ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything we can do to drive CCS globally will have a beneficial effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a concerted effort is needed to make it happen. &quot;CCS has big potential but we need to start thinking about the next phase and how we scale up the industry,&quot; added Richard Howard, chief economist at the Crown Estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond investing in new sources of low carbon energy and reducing emissions, there's also work to be done in reducing demand. Alan Whitehead, Labour MP for Southampton Test and a member of the energy and climate&nbsp;change select committee, says, &quot;It's about how efficiently we use our systems and what we do about demand-side reduction - making our homes and factories more energy-efficient so that demand is reduced. There are enormous gains to be made in how efficiently we use our systems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things like better insulation are not particularly sexy topics but if we can take some demand out of the system that will be really important,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automation could help, with new technology currently being developed for managing energy use. But the &quot;spy in the fridge&quot;, as participants dubbed it, will need to have proven benefits for consumers. &quot;We have got to think long and hard about how we sell this to the consumer,&quot; said Mark Spencer, Conservative MP for Sherwood. &quot;Look at ID cards or GM technology and how they were mis-sold. You have only got one shot at it and if you mess up you never recover from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was support too for a wider look at how transport infrastructure, town planning and employment practices impact on energy use. A decarbonised future will mean changing our lifestyles. &quot;It's about choices - how we manage our homes, how we manage our businesses and what are the choices we make,&quot; said Smith. &quot;It will be a mixture of finding out how we can use less and having the right automation to help that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Seeking to put the best face on a difficult relationship with Beijing, Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States and China could find ways to manage their differences and had more in common than not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither side wanted to fall into the ''trap of zero sum competition,'' Mr. Kerry said at the conclusion of an annual strategic and economic dialogue between top officials of the two countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The array of topics with some areas of agreement -- climate&nbsp;change, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan -- attested to the viability of the relationship, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Kerry used fairly blunt language in an effort to persuade President Xi Jinping that the United States did not intend its 60-year system of alliances in Asia to encircle and contain China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We mean what we say when we emphasize that there's no U.S. strategy to try to push back against or be in conflict with China,'' he said, as Mr. Xi sat beside him during a farewell session at the Great Hall of the People.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry was indirectly replying to charges by Chinese officials that President Obama had reinvigorated America's network of alliances in Asia with the idea of containing China and its fast modernizing military. In response, Mr. Xi has initiated a campaign that calls for a new security architecture of Asia for the Asians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New accusations that Chinese hackers had attacked highly sensitive American material were brusquely dismissed by China, even as the American delegation, headed by Mr. Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, tried to press cyberespionage as an important issue at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Ministry dismissed assertions in an article in The New York Times that Chinese hackers had infiltrated United States government computer systems that house personal information of federal employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the article was part of what he called an irresponsible anti-China smear campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article, first published Wednesday on the newspaper's website, said the hackers had gained access to some of the databases of the Office of Personnel Management before authorities in the United States detected the breach and thwarted further access. It remained unclear what kind of information, if any, was compromised in the attack, which was said to have happened in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the article at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing, a spokesman, Hong Lei, repeated China's longstanding position that it opposes cyberhacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is what we say and what we have been doing,'' he said. ''Recently, some American media and Internet security firms keep playing the card of China Internet Threat and smear China's image. They cannot produce tenable evidence. Such reports and comments are irresponsible and are not worth refuting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the article at a closing news conference, Mr. Kerry said that he and Mr. Lew had been unaware of the attack described in the article and did not raise it with Chinese officials, although the broader subject of cybersecurity was discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We were notified about this alleged incident minutes before coming out here,'' Mr. Kerry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the article was about attempted ''intrusions'' that were still being investigated and it did not appear that sensitive material had been compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior American official who participated in sessions with the Chinese on Thursday said the case of the hacking into the Office of Personnel Management was not raised by either side. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk about a delicate matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese, angered by the indictment by the Justice Department in May of five members of the People's Liberation Army on charges of cyberespionage, refused a request at the dialogue by the Americans to restart a joint cyber working group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China suspended the work of the group that brought together American and Chinese negotiators to discuss cyber issues and has complained that National Security Agency documents made public by Edward J. Snowden showed the United States had used cyberespionage to gain economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Xi, who invited the American and Chinese delegations to meet him Thursday afternoon at a session that was partly open to reporters, called on the two countries to work on building a ''new model of major country relationship,'' a phrase he frequently uses to imply an equal status between the United States and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an expression that the Obama administration has been reluctant to endorse for fear that it would confer legitimacy to China's various territorial claims, including in the East China Sea and South China Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration sent senior officials to the dialogue, including Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve; Michael Froman, the United States trade representative; Ernest Moniz, secretary of energy; Penny Pritzker, secretary of commerce, and John D. Podesta, counselor to President Obama, who specializes in climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans appeared pleased about what they called serious discussions on how to reduce carbon emissions. The presence of Mr. Podesta, who the Chinese know is close to Mr. Obama and is committed to climate&nbsp;change policies, added weight, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint working group on climate&nbsp;change announced that both countries would develop new greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This effort has to be mutual and has to be accompanied by commitments which are defined by the actions we will actually take,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's not about one country making a demand of the other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, China's chief climate official, Xie Zhenhua, said China, which still considers itself a developing country, should not be subject to the same rules for greenhouse gas emissions as the United States, suggesting that Beijing will oppose attempts to impose them at next year's world climate conference in Paris.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are always saying it. What's the supposed cause this time? Rarity of the gene? Unpopularity in the mating pool? Low takeup among artificial insemination users of sperm donations from carrot-tops? I've heard 'em all. Climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out I haven't heard 'em all. Continue. The theory is that red hair (and blue eyes) evolved in countries with generally bad, cloudy weather to maximise the amount of vitamin D a body could take in.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redheads razzle to death in the sun?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm no scientist and I hate to be rude but - this sounds so theoretical as to be in peril of stepping over the line into the Land of Complete Nonsense. How dare you! Although. . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes? Well, we have invented sunscreen. And climate&nbsp;change doesn't necessarily equate to more sun. And most skin cancers occur after your childbearing days are over so there will be nothing preventing the gene reproducing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: With the senate vote on the carbon price repeal imminent, here are five reasons the laws should be kept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the Abbott government has attempted to cut debate on its proposal to repeal&nbsp;the Clean Energy Future Act and abolish Australia's carbon price. The new senate has a powerful cross-bench of independent senators who hold the balance of power; the Abbott government must negotiate either with Labor or the Palmer United Party and other independent senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, coal-baron&nbsp;Clive Palmer dazzled the media and derailed Tony Abbott's climate policy agenda&nbsp;by announcing his party would vote for the retention of the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and in-principle support for an emissions trading scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, his party and an allied independent, Ricky Muir, who was elected under the banner of the Motoring Enthusiasts Party, have the power to keep or destroy Australia's carbon pricing scheme. (Muir has come out recently to support the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and his spokesman has said that Muir supports renewable energy,&nbsp;according to a Guardian report.) However, events move quickly, and senators' votes&nbsp;may change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the misleading rhetoric from Abbott and his climate-denying, renewable energy opposing business advisors, the carbon price has actually done very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of Abbott's&nbsp;histrionic doomsday prophecies have eventuated -&nbsp;there has been no python squeeze, Whyalla remains on the map, a leg of lamb costs less than $100 and electricity prices haven't skyrocketed. In fact, the Australian economy, despite Abbott's&nbsp;car industry mismanagement and industry-policy negligence, has done rather well. Unemployment remains low in most states, economic growth is good, and interests rates are stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that, carbon pollution from regulated sectors is reducing. Renewable energy production is increasing. Clean-energy jobs are growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;carbon price&quot; policy is much more than the price, although that is the most obvious element of it. A far more important part of the Clean Energy Future Act is that it legislates an economy-wide cap on carbon emissions. It is this cap which creates scarcity, and under a trading scheme, allows the market to price carbon pollution permits. If Australia is to be a constructive global player in tackling climate&nbsp;change, the emissions cap is an essential policy element.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Abbott's proposed &quot;direct action&quot; policy for a 5 percent reduction in carbon emissions, there would be no cap on carbon pollution. Thus, despite paying major emitters to reduce their emissions, there would be no overall policy lever for the government to actually achieve that 5 percent target. This is one of the primary reasons that most serious economists and all climate policy commentators have criticised the &quot;direct action&quot; policy as being useless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why would you abolish the carbon price?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's five reasons to keep the carbon price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It's reducing carbon pollution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reason to have a carbon price is to reduce carbon pollution. Well, the&nbsp;Clean Energy Future Act&nbsp;is doing exactly that. After two years of operation, total carbon pollution from electricity consumption in the national energy market is &quot;down by 5.3 million tonnes in the twelve months to May 2014&quot;,&nbsp;according to The Climate Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Australian Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that&nbsp;national emissions continue to drop. Emissions from all&nbsp;sectors excluding land use and forestry fell 0.8 per cent, or&nbsp;4.3 million tonnes in the year to December 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consistent lie by opponents of the carbon price is that it does not reduce carbon emissions or does not have an impact on global warming. Australia is one of the world's largest emitters of carbon pollution, and the largest per capita. Any reduction from Australia not only shows global leadership (which is at risk of the price was abolished) but has a real, measurable impact on the amount of carbon pollution in our atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the&nbsp;Australian economy grew&nbsp;and&nbsp;over 160,000 jobs were created nationally, which demonstrates the falseness of the criticism that Abbott regularly uses that the carbon price was a &quot;hand-brake&quot; on the economy. The price impact of the carbon price has been (as expected) minimal, and far greater influence on electricity costs and other prices are fluctuations in the Australian dollar and commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It's increasing renewable energy (and cutting energy prices)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest lies that Abbott routinely tells is that renewable energy increases electricity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fails the common-sense test. Renewables decreases electricity prices, and even a moment of contemplation shows why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fossil fuels must pay for the cost of digging up, transporting and refining of the coal or gas, as well as massive infrastructure and maintenance of decades old facilities.&nbsp;Renewables have an upfront cost for installation, ongoing maintenance costs, and then gets its energy free from the wind and sun. Fossil fuels is also exposed to commodity market fluctuations, so the sector is exposed to higher natural gas prices, and coal prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Household renewable generators are now growing to such a scale that in some states, they are pushing electricity prices to zero, as Giles Parkinson&nbsp;wrote recently for Comment is Free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Renewable Energy Target is a big reason for the growth in renewables -&nbsp;the target mandates that Australia produce&nbsp;20 percent of its electricity from renewables by the year 2020 -&nbsp;but the carbon price also assists. It does so by adding a cost to the externality of carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of Australia's carbon pollution comes from stationary energy generation, those big coal fired power stations. Until last year, those power stations could pollute with no cost.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Climate Institute&nbsp;noted: &quot;using the International Monetary Fund's approach to energy subsidies and the &quot;social cost&quot; of pollution, the repeal of the carbon price amounted to a subsidy of up to $15 billion to the major polluters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fossil fuel industry is already&nbsp;calculating a shadow price</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major polluters, including fossil fuel producers like Shell, are already operating under a shadow carbon price to plan new projects. Bloomberg reported in May that &quot;Europe's biggest oil company budgets for future capital investment on the assumption it will pay $40 a metric ton for carbon emissions&quot;, and that it is considering boosting this price. In its&nbsp;sustainability report, Shell explained its decision:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without clear measures to promote investment in more efficient and low-carbon technologies, [the world] risks setting itself on a course to potentially catastrophic climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Shell we advocate publicly and to governments that a strong and stable price on CO2 emissions will help drive the right investments in low-carbon technologies. But we are not waiting for government policy to develop. We consider the potential cost of a project's CO2 emissions, which we set at $40 a tonne, in all our major investment decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell is not the only company calculating carbon prices into its business plans. Exxon, the world's biggest oil producer, assumes a $60 per ton price. Other major corporations, including oil giant BP, retail giant Wal-Mart&nbsp;and tech giant&nbsp;Google also include carbon prices in internal strategic planning,&nbsp;according to a Reuters report..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It's future-proofing our industries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the current Abbott government seems intent on eradicating heavy manufacturing in Australia, most notably the car industry, putting a price on carbon will make our industries more globally competitive over the medium to long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effects of climate&nbsp;change will act as a dead-hand on our economy and our industries. Acting now, before the worst effects of global warming hit Australia, can ensure that jobs in industries like manufacturing, energy and mining can be transformed into low-carbon, high-tech jobs. National president of the manufacturing union,&nbsp;Andrew Dettmer wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than turning tradespeople into tour guides, the AMWU sought a high skill future where our skills transform manufacturing by building better transportation, better power generation through wind, solar and other means, and smarter life cycle management of manufactured products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... foundries are one of the success stories of the carbon tax; where nearly $300M was provided to upgrade Australian foundries (most of which date from the 1950s) to newer, lower energy and hence lower emitting smelting technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without policy tools, such as a carbon price and industry policy, the risk is that Abbott's negligence will undermine Australia's economy and jobs market through the double-whammy of a downturn in commodity prices and an eroded manufacturing base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a&nbsp;letter signed by more than 50 Australian economists, the point is made that the carbon price is &quot;a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy, designed&nbsp;to change relative prices in a way that provides an effective incentive to consumers and producers to&nbsp;shift over time to more low-carbon, energy-efficient patterns of consumption and production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The rest of the world is pricing carbon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ABC's fact-checker recently debunked Abbott's often-repeated claim that the world is moving away from pricing carbon,&nbsp;finding that&nbsp;&quot;the reach of carbon pricing is 'steadily increasing'.&quot;&nbsp;Sixty-six&nbsp;countries that account for 88 percent of global emissions have passed laws to address global warming,&nbsp;according to conservative Lord Debsen, former environment minister under Thatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USA for example has enacted wide-ranging national regulations covering carbon emissions, while nine different&nbsp;states, including California and the New England region, have local carbon trading schemes. Obama's new emissions rules&nbsp;would&nbsp;require states to reduce carbon pollution, which could include joining existing state-level cap-and-trade schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China, a major trading partner, is moving to put a cap on carbon emissions, with&nbsp;consideration being given to including it as part of their next Five Year Plan. Within China, there are carbon pricing schemes in seven regional areas, covering 200 million people. Massive renewable energy projects are also being undertaken across China, and China has committed to&nbsp;reducing its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 percent by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the policy mechanism being used is a cap-and-trade, carbon tax or shadow price (i.e. regulations directly curbing carbon pollution), national and state-level governments around the world are putting a price on carbon pollution. As the&nbsp;ABC fact check notes, &quot;economist Ross Garnaut says he doesn't know of anywhere in the world where carbon pricing is being rolled back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carbon pricing laws are working and Australians want to keep&nbsp;them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simple reality is that the carbon price laws are effective, fiscally responsible, and beneficial for Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have had them now for two years, and polls show that most Australians like them. According to Lonergan research&nbsp;last year, three out of five Australians want the laws kept. More recent polling by JWS shows support for the carbon price has been increasing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) June 27, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large number of community leaders this week called on the new senate to keep the carbon reduction and renewable energy laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Services said&nbsp;that ACOSS supports a price on pollution and renewable power laws, because low-income earners are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate&nbsp;change. &quot;People living on low-incomes will be the first and worst hit by the effects of climate&nbsp;change,&quot; she said. &quot;It is irresponsible to repeal the clean energy laws when they remain the only credible and independently assessed mechanism for Australia to adopt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Moore, CEO of the Public Health Association of Australia, said on Tuesday: &quot;global warming is not only an environmental issue. Without dramatic action the potential for adverse impacts on health are enormous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Beth Heyde from the Anglican General Synod said: &quot;The Synod met just last week and unanimously expressed grave concern to the Government that a market mechanism such as an emission trading scheme is not part of its strategy to address climate&nbsp;change.&quot; She noted, &quot;a&nbsp;market mechanism such as an Emissions Trading Scheme is not a carbon tax -&nbsp;it is a key way by which 21st century Australia can achieve two important goals: lowering the very serious risks from global warming which have been so clearly identified by the IPCC, and&nbsp;moving to a thriving, sustainable economy based on renewable energy rather than fossil fuels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the new senators&nbsp;support taking action to reduce the impacts of global warming, then it should vote to keep the carbon price, and especially the carbon cap.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Rutherford: The 'extinction of the ginger gene' story is just bad science designed to sell ancestry tests. Red hair is here to stay</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redheads, rest easy: your chances of climate&nbsp;change-induced extinction are identical to those of people with less exhilarating hair colour. This seemingly obvious fact will no doubt drown in the current deluge of coverage declaring that gingers are genetically doomed. The source? A company that sells genetic ancestry testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's deal with the science. Red hair is caused by changes in a single gene, and exists in the overall population at about 4-5%, making it beautifully rare. Its increased prevalence in Scots (and the Welsh and English, and other northern European populations) is probably due to a degree of isolation in an ancestral group at some point in our ancient history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gene is recessive, which means that both parents have to pass it on for their child to be red-haired. Various reports quote a scientist &quot;who did not wish to be named&quot; saying &quot;I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out&quot;. I've studied and written about genetics for 20 years now, and I've not come across &quot;regressive&quot; genes before. I'm willing to give this mystery scientist leeway that this was an error by the journalist, and the enigmatic-but-no-doubt-very-credible researcher meant &quot;recessive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of whether humans are still evolving crops up every now and then. Our genes change over time, and the frequency of those genes in populations changes too. The change is slow, and we have largely unshackled ourselves from the forces of natural selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this particular case, it is very hard to think of a way that the ginger gene might be extinguished. The selective pressure asserted in this tale is that redheads exist as an adaptation to cloudy weather in Scotland. Alas, there is scant evidence for that - scientists are still debating if the red-hair gene or, indeed, any of the genes that affect skin, hair and eye colour, spread because of a lack of sunlight, or because of some sort of mate preference, or just by offchance. Nor am I aware of any evidence that Scotland is getting less cloudy as a result of climate&nbsp;change. To become extinct, ginger hair would have to be a powerfully maladaptive condition, which of course it is not. It's a very lovely condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how the ginger gene could vanish: not only would every redhead have to stop having sex for some reason, but every carrier of the gene would too. As someone who finds red hair rather attractive, should this come to pass, I will volunteer to help them out of their imaginary celibate rut. Sadly, unless some Eric Cartman-esque genocide transpires, I am supremely confident that my services will not be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, if this were a hair commercial, I would move on by saying &quot;that was the science bit&quot;. In fact, this whole tedious saga is just an advertisement - and science by press release. Finding out your redhead genetic status is merely a &pound;25 add-on to one of the genetic ancestry packages from ScotlandsDNA. The company's chief executive, Alistair Moffat, is the source of this latest septic wave of genetic astrology. Moffat is the rector of St Andrews University. I can find no evidence that he has any qualifications in genetics, though this has not deterred him from frequent assertions about the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, Moffat appeared on Radio 4's Today programme making some unsupported claims concerning the ancestry of some Brits being Tuareg, Berber and even the Queen of Sheba. Geneticists David Balding and Mark Thomas from University College London issued complaints to the BBC, to the company's chief scientist, Jim Wilson from Edinburgh University, and a detailed letter to Moffat pointing out the multiple fallacies in his claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the complaints, Moffat wrote to the then provost of UCL, Malcolm Grant, demanding that he force Balding and Thomas to back off. Grant told him that he would do well to respect academic freedom - a polite scholarly way of telling him to sod off. Legal threats were issued and the whole sorry saga is documented in necessary detail on the UCL website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, following a press release from Moffat's sister company, BritainsDNA, many newspapers devoted chunky column inches to the revelation that Prince William carries Indian DNA. It took a genetic genealogist - Debbie Kennett, an honorary fellow at UCL - to thoroughly debunk this wobbly piece of scientific trivia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These promises of DNA and ancestry are everywhere. They are seductive because they are simple and clean, but alas humans are not. We are messy, and our DNA is almost inscrutable. Genetics is complex, and anyone who tells you different is selling something. I will be plugging my own book on the stories we can and can't tell about human genetics in a year's time. There is so much joy and wonder in science, in the poetry locked in our genomes. Its publication is now put off by one day, as today I chose to write not about the marvel of DNA, but to prick this bubble of flapdoodle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- In a closed-door session at a high-level gathering of Chinese and American officials here on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged China to follow maritime law in nearby seas to reduce regional tensions, a senior American official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry called on China to support the creation of a legally binding code of conduct that other Asian nations are considering to enforce rules of navigation and inhibit unilateral actions in the South China and East China Seas, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under standard protocol.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary met with Yang Jiechi, a state councilor who deals with foreign policy, on the first day of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual gathering of senior officials from both countries where differences on issues including national security, the economy, climate&nbsp;change and human rights are aired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The secretary emphasized this is not a situation in which countries should or can be permitted simply to act unilaterally to advance their territorial claims or interests,'' said the official, alluding to China's dispatch of a huge oil rig to disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam in May and the virtual takeover in 2012 of a reef, the Scarborough Shoal, that is claimed by the Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry also said efforts to create a ''new status quo'' at the expense of regional harmony were ''unacceptable,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maneuvers by China to assert claims over islands and waters in the South China Sea, and to slow the efforts of a regional group, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to complete a code of conduct that would govern maritime rules have become a major point of friction between Washington and Beijing. The South China Sea is one of the world's busiest trading routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Xi Jinping opened the two-day event, saying a solid relationship between China and the United States was vital for everyone. ''Cooperation between China and the U.S. will benefit the world, while the opposite will bring disaster,'' Mr. Xi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed China's economic and military strength. ''The vast Pacific Ocean has ample space to accommodate two great nations,'' he said, a comment suggesting that America's domination of the Asia-Pacific region over the last 60 years will not last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his meeting with Mr. Yang, a diplomat known for his frank demeanor, Mr. Kerry set out Washington's objections to China's policies on several fronts and defended America's alliances in Asia, arrangements that have come under stiff criticism from Beijing, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary discussed China's deteriorating human rights record, citing specific cases of people imprisoned for many years, as well as those jailed in the last few months during a crackdown on lawyers and journalists, the official said. ''In particular, he described our perception of the trend of an increase in arrests and harassment of individuals expressing political views,'' the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China declined to hold a human rights dialogue with the United States this year, apparently in retribution for President Obama's meeting in February with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who promotes autonomy from China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspension of the human rights discussion came despite meetings in recent years between Chinese and American officials led by the assistant secretary of state for human rights to discuss human rights and religious persecution in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry called for the human rights talks to resume, the official said. Similarly, he asked that China agree to continue formal talks on cybersecurity that China suspended in May after the indictment of five members of the People's Liberation Army by a United States grand jury on charges of cyberespionage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American special envoy on climate&nbsp;change, Todd Stern, met with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission and a powerful figure in the Chinese bureaucracy. ''We are making a great effort on our internal reasoning so we can make due contributions to climate&nbsp;change,'' Mr. Xie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there was no breakthrough agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, American officials said they detected more determination by the Chinese to curb pollution, which has become so bad that some Chinese leaders see it as a possible cause of political instability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as 500 potential new flood defence projects have also been put on hold, further threatening communities and businesses as the effects of global warming - including more flooding, droughts and fiercer storms - take hold. Last winter's devastating floods in England are likely to be repeated as houses continue to be built on flood plains, and householders are woefully unaware of the risks, according to research by the Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change (CCC), the statutory adviser to the government on the effects of global warming on the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warned that neglecting the need for stronger defences now, because of budget cuts, would simply increase the financial cost in future years. For every &pound;1 spent on flood defences, an estimated &pound;8 is saved, from insurance and the cost of damage to homes and businesses. Fiona Harvey</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what your future will look like if we are to have a shot at preventing devastating climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within about 15 years every new car sold in the United States will be electric. In fact, by midcentury more than half of the American economy will run on electricity. Up to 60 percent of power might come from nuclear sources. And coal's footprint will shrink drastically, perhaps even disappear from the power supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This course, created by a team of energy experts, was unveiled on Tuesday in a report for the United Nations that explores the technological paths available for the world's 15 main economies to both maintain reasonable rates of growth and cut their carbon emissions enough by 2050 to prevent climatic havoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It offers a sobering conclusion. We might be able to pull it off. But it will take an overhaul of the way we use energy, and a huge investment in the development and deployment of new energy technologies. Significantly, it calls for an entirely different approach to international diplomacy on the issue of how to combat climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This will require a heroic cooperative effort,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who directs the Sustainable Development Solutions Network at the United Nations, which convened the multinational teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams, one in each of the 15 countries, looked at what would be necessary to keep the atmosphere from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above the preindustrial average of the late 19th century, a target that most of the world committed to at the climate summit meeting in Copenhagen five years ago. To do so, CO2 emissions from industry and energy use would have to fall to at most 1.6 tons a year for every person on the planet by midcentury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is less than a tenth of annual American emissions per person today and less than a third of the world average. And we haven't quite figured out how to get from here to there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American team built several paths that would hit the target, using different mixes of nuclear power, renewable energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage technology. So did the Russian team, aided by the expected shrinking of the Russian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Chinese team was stymied by the country's vast heavy industry -- its steel makers and cement plants, which use enormous amounts of energy. The best it could do was chart a path that took CO2 emissions to some 3.4 tons per person by midcentury. ''We have shipped a lot of industry to China,'' Mr. Sachs said. ''Industry is hard to decarbonize.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, the teams built plausible technological paths to cut annual emissions across the 15 countries only to about 2.3 tons per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis, however, offers solid ground for hope. The teams expect to improve on these paths in coming months. Faster deployment of some technologies than assumed could provide for deeper decarbonization in several countries. What's more, likely changes in economic structure in coming decades -- such as China's expected shift away from heavy industry -- could further shrink the carbon footprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, the assessment offers an opportunity to end decades of inconsequential horse-trading over climate&nbsp;change and to start addressing the problem for real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years since political leaders from countries around the world committed to do whatever it took to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees above the preindustrial average, no one had taken the trouble, until now, to evaluate how that might be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lacking any understanding of the feasibility of the exercise, governments postured and jockeyed over which country should be responsible for what, offering as little as they could get away with in actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, whether the collective effort met the two-degree commitment or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If governments don't have any idea of what two degrees means in their countries, how can they commit to two degrees?'' asked Guido Schmidt-Traub, executive director of the Sustainable Development Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report commissioned by the United Nations could end the jockeying: to stick to the two-degree limit every country, rich and poor, must reduce annual CO2 emissions to 1.6 tons per person, whether it is responsible for a lot or a little of the climate&nbsp;change so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is dictated not by fairness, but by our technological frontier. There is wiggle room for negotiation. China's emissions from manufacturing would look smaller if they were allocated to consuming rather than producing countries. Still, we know of no feasible technology that would allow, say, the United States to have negative emissions in 2050 so India or China could emit more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new assessment also underscores the pointlessness of small, incremental emissions cuts. Under the path, the United States decarbonizes its energy supply at an average pace of almost 4 percent a year over the next four decades. That is more than 10 times faster than the Energy Information Administration's forecast last year. China takes CO2 out of its energy about six times as fast as the E.I.A.'s forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not achievable by going after low-hanging fruit, such as replacing coal with natural gas in power plants. Doing so could even be counterproductive, locking the country's energy infrastructure into a high-carbon path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, perhaps, the new assessment suggests that deep decarbonization can be done without breaking any economy. Chinese incomes, for instance, are assumed to grow about 4.6 percent a year until midcentury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decarbonization paths rely on aggressive assumptions about our ability to deploy new technologies on a commercial scale economically. For instance, carbon capture and storage is supposed to be available starting in about 10 years. Second-generation biofuels are assumed to come into play by 2020. Hydrogen fuel cells and power storage technology are deployed starting around 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these technologies all exist today and seem reasonably scalable. The teams did not rely on more speculative technologies, like cold fusion, to make their numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new approach -- which the United Nations hopes will inform the debate up to the next climate summit in Paris in fall 2015 -- could offer a path out of the stalemate that international climate negotiations have become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No country will commit legally to slash its CO2 emissions by 80 percent over the next 40 years. But if there is a map, many might offer their best effort to follow it. Absent a legal commitment, a long-term path could encourage the large investments ultimately required to address the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Governments won't precommit to huge technological revolutions on a legal basis,'' Professor Sachs said. ''Countries might be willing to aspire more on a conditional basis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, countries are more likely to participate if they understand what everybody else is trying. ''The Chinese want to see an American pathway to two degrees,'' Mr. Schmidt-Traub said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big challenges remain. Any 40-year forecast must be taken with some skepticism. Technologies that seem feasible and economic today might turn out not to be. And it bears repeating that though the teams contend they can get to 1.6 tons per person, they have not yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia, for instance, hit the target. But Oleg Lugovoy of the Environmental Defense Fund, who worked on the Russian plan, observed that ''if we don't have carbon capture and storage we would have to reconsider.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while sketching a technological path toward a low carbon economy will certainly help ground in reality the abstract negotiations over the future of climate, it does not do away with the main hitch that has stumped progress for decades: How much will this all cost and who will pay for it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team purposefully did not assess the costs of their paths to prevent distributional arguments from flaring up immediately. That gives policy makers space to consider the implications without having to stake out a negotiating stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assessment of costs and how they could be distributed will be added in a next iteration to be published next spring. Debates over cost allocation and technology transfer could still hamstring prospects of substantive international collaboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite these risks, the report offers a promising new path to overcome the decades-old logjam of climate&nbsp;change negotiations. For the first time, when we say we can stop the climate from heating we will more or less know what we are talking about.</SPAN></P>

These are that growth will slow to around two-thirds its current rate; that inequality will increase massively; and that there is a big risk that climate&nbsp;change will make things worse. Despite all this, says the OECD, the world will be four times richer, more productive, more globalised and more highly educated. If you are struggling to rationalise the two halves of that prediction then don't worry - so are some of the best-qualified economists on earth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World growth will slow to 2.7%, says the Paris-based thinktank, because the catch-up effects boosting growth in the developing world - population growth, education, urbanisation - will peter out. Even before that happens, near-stagnation in advanced economies means a long-term global average over the next 50 years of just 3% growth, which is low. The growth of high-skilled jobs and the automation of medium-skilled jobs means, on the central projection, that inequality will rise by 30%. By 2060 countries such as Sweden will have levels of inequality currently seen in the USA: think Gary, Indiana, in the suburbs of Stockholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole projection is overlaid by the risk that the economic effects of climate&nbsp;change begin to destroy capital, coastal land and agriculture in the first half of the century, shaving up to 2.5% off world GDP and 6% in south-east Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bleakest part of the OECD report lies not in what it projects but what it assumes. It assumes, first, a rapid rise in productivity, due to information technology. Three-quarters of all the growth expected comes from this. However, that assumption is, as the report states euphemistically, &quot;high compared with recent history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no certainty at all that the information revolution of the past 20 years will cascade down into ever more highly productive and value-creating industries. The OECD said last year that, while the internet had probably boosted the US economy by up to 13%, the wider economic effects were probably bigger, unmeasurable and not captured by the market. The veteran US economist Robert Gordon has suggested the productivity boost from info-tech is real but already spent. Either way, there is a fairly big risk that the meagre 3% growth projected comes closer to 1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there's the migration problem. To make the central scenario work, Europe and the USA each have to absorb 50 million migrants between now and 2060, with the rest of the developed world absorbing another 30 million. Without that, the workforce and the tax base shrinks so badly that states go bust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main risk the OECD models is that developing countries improve so fast that people stop migrating. The more obvious risk - as signalled by a 27% vote for the Front National in France and the riotous crowds haranguing migrants on the California border - is that developed-world populations will not accept it. That, however, is not considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now imagine the world of the central scenario: Los Angeles and Detroit look like Manila - abject slums alongside guarded skyscrapers; the UK workforce is a mixture of old white people and newly arrived young migrants; the middle-income job has all but disappeared. If born in 2014, then by 2060 you are either a 45-year-old barrister or a 45-year-old barista. There will be not much in-between. Capitalism will be in its fourth decade of stagnation and then - if we've done nothing about carbon emissions - the really serious impacts of climate&nbsp;change are starting to kick in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OECD has a clear message: for the rich countries, the best of capitalism is over. For the poor ones - now experiencing the glitter and haze of industrialisation - it will be over by 2060. If you want higher growth, says the OECD, you must accept higher inequality. And vice versa. Even to achieve a meagre average global growth rate of 3% we have to make labour &quot;more flexible&quot;, the economy more globalised. Those migrants scrambling over the fences at the Spanish city of Melilla, next to Morocco, we have to welcome, en masse, to the tune of maybe two or three million a year into the developed world, for the next 50 years. And we have to achieve this without the global order fragmenting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh and there's the tax problem. The report points out that, with the polarisation between high and low incomes, we will have to move - as Thomas Piketty suggests - to taxes on wealth. The problem here, the OECD points out, is that assets - whether they be a star racehorse, a secret bank account or the copyright on a brand's logo - tend to be intangible and therefore held in jurisdictions dedicated to avoiding wealth taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OECD's prescription - more globalisation, more privatisation, more austerity, more migration and a wealth tax if you can pull it off - will carry weight. But not with everybody. The ultimate lesson from the report is that, sooner or later, an alternative programme to &quot;more of the same&quot; will emerge. Because populations armed with smartphones, and an increased sense of their human rights, will not accept a future of high inequality and low growth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hoare: I have been at the wrong end of a defecating sperm whale: it smells, it's nutrient rich, and could just save the world</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first success of the environmental movements of the 1960s was to save the whale. Now, with deep irony, whales may be about to save us with their poo. A new scientific report from the University of Vermont, which gathers together several decades of research, shows that the great whales which nearly became extinct in the 20th century - and are now recovering in number due to the 1983 ban on whaling - may be the enablers of massive carbon sinks via their prodigious production of faeces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do the nutrients in whale poo feed other organisms, from phytoplankton upwards - and thereby absorb the carbon we humans are pumping into the atmosphere - even in death the sinking bodies of these massive animals create new resources on the sea bed, where entire species exist solely to graze on rotting whale. There's an additional and direct benefit for humans, too. Contrary to the suspicions of fishermen that whales take their catch, cetacean recovery could &quot;lead to higher rates of productivity in locations where whales aggregate to feed and give birth&quot;. Their fertilizing faeces here, too, would encourage phytoplankton which in turn would encourage healthier fisheries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such propositions speak to our own species' arrogance. As demonstrated in the fantastical geoengineering projects dreamed up to address climate&nbsp;change, the human race's belief that the world revolves around it knows no bounds. What if whales were nature's ultimate geoengineers? The new report only underlines what has been suspected for some time: that cetaceans, both living and dead, are ecosystems in their own right. But it also raises a hitherto unexplored prospect, that climate&nbsp;change may have been accelerated by the terrible whale culls of the 20th century, which removed hundreds of thousands of these ultimate facilitators of CO2 absorption. As Greg Gatenby, the acclaimed Canadian writer on whales told me in response to the Vermont report, &quot;about 300,000 blue whales were taken in the 20th century. If you average each whale at 100 tons, that makes for the removal from the ocean of approximately 30m tons of biomass. And that's just for one species&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's another irony here, too. American whaling, as celebrated in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), declined in part because of the discovery of mineral oil wells in the second half of the 19th century. One unsustainable resource - the whale oil which lit and lubricated the industrial revolution - was replaced by another. By killing so many whales, then turning to carbon-emitting mineral oil, humans created a double-whammy for climate&nbsp;change. (Conversely, and perhaps perversely, some US commentators have claimed that capitalism saved the whales rather than environmentalists. They contend that our use of mineral oil actually alleviated the pressure on whale populations - proof, they say, that human ingenuity has the ultimate power to solve the planet's problems).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 scientists who jointly contributed to the new paper note the benefits of &quot;an ocean repopulated by the great whales&quot;. Working on a whalewatching boat off Cape Cod last month, I witnessed astonishing numbers of fin whales, humpbacks and minkes feeding on vast schools of sand eels. I watched dozens of whales at a time, co-operatively hoovering up the bait - and producing plentiful clouds of poo in the process. (Having been at the receiving end of a defecating sperm whale, I can testify to its richly odiferous qualities.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers in the Azores have reported similarly remarkable concentrations of cetaceans this summer. And with a 10% increase in humpback calves returning to Australian waters each year, and blue whales being seen in the Irish Sea, a burgeoning global population of cetaceans might not just be good for the whalewatching industry, they may play a significant role in the planet's rearguard action against climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would certainly be a generous return on their part, given what we've inflicted on them. Indeed, as Melville imagined in his prophetic chapter in Moby-Dick, Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?, the whale might yet have the last laugh, regaining its reign in a flooded world of the future to &quot;spout his frothed defiance to the skies&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drax, the operator of Britain's biggest power station, has secured up to (EURO)300m (&pound;238m) of European Union funding to build a power plant whose carbon dioxide emissions will be trapped and buried deep beneath the North Sea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new plant will be built on land next to Drax's existing power station near Selby in Yorkshire. It will burn enough coal for 630,000 homes and 90% of its CO2 will be transported by pipeline for permanent storage under the North Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, called White Rose, is a joint venture between Drax, Alstom and BOC and is the first large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the EU. White Rose will capture and bury the plant's CO2 with transport and storage provided by National Grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh Hackett, chief executive of Capture Power, which runs White Rose, said: &quot;The NER300 award represents another significant milestone for us in our development programme and an important potential source of funding for the project, as well as providing a strong signal for CCS in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are well on track to demonstrate the key role that CCS can play in the future UK energy mix. CCS is an important technology providing clean, reliable and cost competitive electricity with the potential to contribute greatly to the decarbonisation of global power markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament's energy and climate&nbsp;change committee called in May for the UK's first CCS plants to be fast-trackedbecause they were vital to limit climate&nbsp;change. The MPs criticised the government's conduct of its &pound;1bn competition for the first plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White Rose applied for funding from the European NER300 programme a year ago. NER300 is a fund set up by the European Commission to encourage low-carbon energy projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award to White Rose is one of 19 to projects across the EU totalling (EURO)1bn. They are designed to encourage private investment in green energy programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connie Hedegaard, EU commissioner for climate action, said: &quot;With these first-of-a-kind projects, we will help protect the climate and make Europe less energy dependent. The (EURO)1bn we are awarding today will leverage some additional (EURO)900m of private investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate scientists long ago settled among themselves the question of whether human emissions of greenhouse gases are a problem, concluding that we are running some grave risks. But the field still features vigorous debate about how bad global warming will get, how quickly, and how to combat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest fights involves how much effort to put into stopping leaks of methane gas into the atmosphere. It may sound like an obscure topic, but the leaks could have a great effect on the climate that people living today experience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue has grown in importance with the release of President Obama's new climate plan. It calls for greater use of natural gas, which consists mostly of methane. Among a few academics and on the far left of the environmental movement, cries are going up that the president is about to lock America into a supposed solution to climate&nbsp;change that will be worse than burning coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is that claim plausible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic scientific facts are pretty clear. By far the most important greenhouse gas that humans are spewing into the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, which comes from burning fossil fuels. The second most important is methane, which comes from many sources. It is released when coal is mined; it escapes when wells are drilled for oil or natural gas; and it leaks from pipes that distribute natural gas. Certain agricultural practices also throw up a huge amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pound for pound, methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. But in stark contrast to CO2, methane breaks down quickly in the atmosphere. Every time you flip on a light switch, causing more coal to be burned and CO2 to be released, you are slightly altering the earth's climate for thousands of years. Release a puff of methane, scientists say, and the climate influence will be gone in a few decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The methane is like a hangover that you can get over if you stop drinking,'' said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, a climate scientist at the University of Chicago and the author of a textbook on planetary atmospheres. ''CO2 is more like lead poisoning -- it sticks around, you don't get rid of it, and it causes irreversible harm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that difference, billions of dollars are being spent to control methane leaks, and some people argue for spending more. Dr. Pierrehumbert is a leading voice challenging that approach. He argues, essentially, that the world has yet to mount a serious effort to control carbon dioxide, which will be vastly more harmful in the long run, and that methane and other short-term pollutants should largely be ignored until that bigger problem is fixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He summarizes his position by adapting St. Augustine's plea for chastity: ''Lord, give me methane control, but not yet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the opposite view are scientists who argue that the short-term effect of methane presents an opportunity not to be overlooked. Global warming is already a problem, they point out, noting the rise of certain extreme weather events. Aggressively controlling methane, they say, would help slow the warming sharply over the coming decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, ''our success in controlling CO2 emissions is likely to make very little difference on temperature over the next 40 years,'' said Drew Shindell, a longtime NASA climate scientist who is leaving for Duke University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and other scientists who see the issue this way have had some success in the last few years helping to persuade the United Nations, the United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations to back efforts to control the release of methane, as well as other short-term pollutants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what has all this got to do with the president's climate plan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's administration intends to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2030. That will push states toward much greater use of natural gas to generate electricity -- a shift that is seen as combating global warming because, in a power plant, burning natural gas emits roughly half the carbon dioxide as burning coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan effectively puts the administration on the side of increased natural gas production, including through the controversial technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Grass-roots environmental groups have erupted, contending that leaks from this form of gas production will effectively cancel out any claimed climate benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the scientific evidence suggests that could perhaps be true over the next few decades, the argument effectively ignores the fate of human generations beyond that. Experts say that, looking at the more distant future, it is hugely important to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere now, even if that requires burning more gas. Dr. Pierrehumbert and Dr. Shindell largely agree on this point, with Dr. Pierrehumbert discounting the gas-is-worse-than-coal argument as ''bunkum.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger issue is a tough one. If only a limited amount of political capital and money is going to be available to tackle global warming, that would weigh in favor of Dr. Pierrehumbert's argument for ignoring methane leaks for the time being. Dr. Shindell agrees that methane control should not be pursued at the expense of CO2 control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe there is a way out of this conundrum. What is the chance that a two-pronged attack on climate&nbsp;change would increase the overall level of political will?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea would be to promise far more aggressive methane control to slow global warming for the benefit of people alive today, along with aggressive CO2 control for the benefit of future generations. If the prospect of near-term climate benefits could spur a notable increase in public support for longer-term measures, too, that would certainly tilt the argument in Dr. Shindell's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDF, which operates most of Britain's nuclear power stations, could be in line for an &pound;800m windfall via a loophole in a government subsidy scheme aimed at keeping the lights on at times of peak demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Davey, the energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary, last week outlined his plan to pay power plants to be on standby from 2018 to deal with peak demand and the intermittency of wind power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most industry experts assumed that the &quot;capacity market&quot; scheme - the cost of which will be passed to the consumer - was designed to ensure that the many gas-fired power stations threatened with closure would be kept open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change (Decc) now admits the scheme will be open to all forms of generation including nuclear, which has low operating costs and therefore could undercut its competitors in the auction to be run by the National Grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market is meant to start with that auction later this year although the ratings agency Moody's has warned it may be delayed if it is found to breach European commission rules on state aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All but one of the UK's nuclear power plants are owned by the largely French state-owned EDF, whose UK atomic portfolio includes seven ageing plants due to be closed by 2024.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cornwall Energy, a power industry consultant, estimates that successful bids by EDF using all seven of its existing plants could be worth &pound;223m in the 2018-19 financial year and &pound;818m in total by 2023.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson Steele, an analyst at the investment bank Berenberg, described the potential for nuclear to take advantage of the scheme as a &quot;slight anomaly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an energy trader, who asked not to be named, said: &quot;This is a massive windfall for EDF. The cost to generate nuclear energy is low, so these plants are profitable, whereas gas-fired generation is marginal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDF was unwilling to say whether it would participate in the capacity auctions, which will be held in December, with the delivery of power to commence from 2018. But a spokesman said: &quot;We understand that the capacity auction will be technology neutral and theoretically rules in nuclear power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won't be giving any steer on what power plants we will be entering into the capacity auction until the pre-qualification period in August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it is built, EDF's Hinkley Point C power plant will not be eligible for the capacity market as it will be subject to another, more generous subsidy scheme known as &quot;contracts for difference&quot; (CfD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy and climate&nbsp;change select committee, was told about the decision to include nuclear power by the Guardian. He said he was surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The capacity market is designed to provide flexibility and this is a rather perverse consequence of that. Decc seem to have rather a lot on their plate and they're quite an under-resourced team,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department said it was too early to predict who would win what in the future bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to note that the capacity contracted in the capacity market will be determined by a competitive auction so it is not possible to say with certainty what proportions of each technologies will be procured,&quot; Decc said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Greatrex, the shadow energy minister, said the value of letting existing nuclear capacity take part in the auctions seemed dubious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nuclear is a significant baseload power source, but is not flexible enough to be part of an efficient capacity market. There are, therefore, serious questions as to why Decc ministers have given nuclear power stations the green light to bid for capacity payments when they won't be able to add flexible capacity to the mix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow Labour MP Alan Whitehead, who is a member of the energy and climate&nbsp;change select committee, wrote in a blog that the capacity market system was far too expensive and was five times more than a previous government plan to set up an emergency &quot;strategic reserve&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capacity scheme is also too extensive, he wrote: &quot;It strikes me as rather like announcing that you are going to concrete over the Somerset levels to a height of six feet and then proclaim that a flood prevention strategy is now fully in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report on the UK energy sector, Moody's predicted the European commission may determine that the design of the capacity payments scheme may have to be changed, triggering delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decc said it remained confident that this would not happen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In November 2010, three combatants gathered in a sleek office here to build a carbon emissions policy that they hoped to sell to the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was a lawyer who had been wielding the Clean Air Act since his days at the University of California, Berkeley. Another had turned to practicing environmental law and writing federal regulations to curb pollution after spending a summer on a pristine island off Nova Scotia. The third, a climate scientist who is a fixture on Capitol Hill, became an environmentalist because of postcollege backpacking trips in the Rockies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three were as seasoned and well connected as Washington's best-paid lobbyists because of their decades of experience and the relationships they formed in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next two years the lawyers, David Doniger and David Hawkins, and the scientist, Daniel Lashof, worked with a team of experts to write a 110-page proposal, widely viewed as innovative and audacious, that was aimed at slashing planet-warming carbon pollution from the nation's coal-fired power plants. On June 2, President Obama proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency rule to curb power plant emissions that used as its blueprint the work of the three men and their team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a remarkable victory for the Natural Resources Defense Council, the longtime home of Mr. Doniger and Mr. Hawkins and, until recently, of Mr. Lashof. The organization has a reach that extends from the big donors of Wall Street to the elite of Hollywood (Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford are on its board) to the far corners of the Environmental Protection Agency, where Mr. Doniger and Mr. Hawkins once worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's leaders understand the art of influence: In successfully drafting a climate plan that heavily influenced the president's proposal, the organization followed the strategy used by the American Petroleum Institute, the lobbying arm of the oil industry, to write an energy policy for Vice President Dick Cheney during the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The N.R.D.C. proposal has its fingerprints throughout this, for sure,'' said Dallas Burtraw, an energy policy expert at Resources for the Future, a Washington nonprofit, describing how the council's work influenced the proposed 650-page environmental regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the coal industry agreed. ''N.R.D.C. is crafting regulatory policy for the E.P.A. that is designed to advance their agenda at the cost of American businesses and people who will pay the price through much higher electricity rates,'' wrote Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobbying group. Scott Segal, who lobbies for the coal industry with the firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani, said in an email that the council's experts ''have unprecedented access to this E.P.A. and are able to project influence down to the details of regulatory proposals and creative legal theories.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was so certain of the council's sway that it used the group's proposal as the basis for its economic analysis of what it expected in the E.P.A. rule, before the rule's actual release. ''It is no surprise that N.R.D.C. has a great deal of influence on E.P.A. and the White House,'' Matthew LeTourneau, a chamber spokesman, wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its founding in 1970, the Natural Resources Defense Council has not sought the public profile of activist organizations like Greenpeace, but it has piled up a string of substantial legal and policy victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its annual budget of about $120 million is far higher than that of most environmental groups, in part because of board members like Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Redford, who are the attractions at lavish fund-raising galas for studio heads and Silicon Valley magnates. In a typical event in 2011, guests at the Malibu home of Ron Meyer, now the vice chairman of NBCUniversal, sipped Champagne and watched surfers paddle out to form a peace sign in the Pacific Ocean. The event raised $2.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council's fund-raising office in New York has also found big donors in the business world, including at Google and Goldman Sachs. ''With N.R.D.C., I would like to think I'm getting the best bang for the buck,'' said Alan F. Horn, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios and a member of the group's board. ''These people are steeped in expertise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Doniger, 62, has spent 40 years, as he put it, ''using legal skills to combat pollution.'' He joined the Natural Resources Defense Council soon after graduating from law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and spent seven years as a senior clean-air lawyer at the E.P.A. during the Clinton administration. He went back to the environmental group during the Bush administration and in 2007 helped write the legal briefs for a landmark Supreme Court case upholding the E.P.A.'s authority to enact climate-change regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hawkins, 71, quit Columbia University's law school but returned after living with his wife on MacLeans Island, off Nova Scotia. ''It made me appreciate how magical the cycles of natural systems were, and I knew I wanted to go back and do environmental protection with my law degree,'' he said. He worked at the E.P.A. in the Carter administration, where he developed regulations to cut soot and smog from smokestacks, angering industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lashof, 54, who has a Ph.D. in energy and natural resources from Berkeley, worked at a government solar-energy laboratory in Colorado, where hikes in remote pockets of the Rockies spurred his interest in the environment. This year he became chief operating officer at NextGen Climate, the ''super PAC'' run by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together the three men and their team worked in the group's green 15th Street office -- the space includes an energy-saving lighting system and an indoor garden wall of plants -- to conceive the novel idea at the heart of Mr. Obama's climate-change rule. Rather than impose a uniform national standard for reducing power-plant carbon emissions, the regulation sets different limits for each state and allows states the flexibility to meet the standards by picking from a menu of policy options -- including creating state programs that require power plants to pay a fee for their carbon pollution; installing new wind and solar power; and making appliances, lighting and air conditioning more energy efficient. Once enacted, such a plan could do far more than just shut down coal plants; it could spur a transformation of the nation's electricity sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's remarkable, it's novel, it's really controversial, and that's the centerpiece of the N.R.D.C. approach,'' said Charles Knauss, an environmental lawyer and a former Republican congressional counsel on clean-air law. But Mr. Knauss and others said the rule's structure also made it more vulnerable to lawsuits. While clean-air regulations have historically prescribed specific remedies to cut smokestack pollution, the N.R.D.C. approach allows states unprecedented flexibility, creating multiple openings for legal attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To crunch numbers, the council hired the same statistics firm used by the E.P.A. in order to ensure that the agency could more easily adopt the plan. The cost, Mr. Doniger said, was ''a few hundred thousand dollars.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.P.A. said the Natural Resources Defense Council did not wield outsize influence in shaping the regulation. When preparing the climate-change rule, the agency sought comments from hundreds of groups, including environmental advocates, state regulators, electric utilities and the coal industry, while dozens of E.P.A. analysts and legal experts worked on the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We had 5,000 conversations,'' said Joseph Goffman, the E.P.A.'s top clean-air lawyer. ''It's impossible to say there was any one thing. The E.P.A.'s plan, for example, does not cut pollution as quickly or deeply as the council's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indisputable, however, is that the Natural Resources Defense Council was far ahead of the E.P.A. in drafting the architecture of the proposed regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late 2012, Mr. Doniger, Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Lashof had finished their proposal and began to travel across the country to present it to state regulators, electric utilities, executives and anyone else they expected to have a hand in shaping the rules. In Washington, Mr. Doniger briefed Mr. Goffman at the E.P.A. and Mr. Obama's senior climate adviser at the time, Heather Zichal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The goal was to move this idea very quickly into the public conversation and affect as many people's thinking as possible,'' Mr. Doniger wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.P.A. officials did not start working in earnest on the rule until fall 2013, when they held sessions around the country to hear from regulators, utilities and many others the Natural Resources Defense Council had by then been briefing for months. Many told the E.P.A. that they wanted to see an innovative plan like the one they had heard about from the council, even if they did not specifically name it as the group's plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They were the first out of the gate,'' said Adam Kushner, a former top legal official at the E.P.A. ''And the first out of the gate frames the debate.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politics of climate&nbsp;change are veering in starkly different directions in the neighboring states of North Carolina and Virginia. Foolhardy denial about the severity of rising seas is underway in North Carolina, where the Republican Legislature, prodded by tourism-dependent coastal counties and alarmed homeowners, ordered a state commission of experts to soften its estimate that coastal waters could rise 39 inches by the end of the century. The commission was told to revise its outlook, take into account dissenting views of climate&nbsp;change and produce a forecast of no more than 30 years -- in hopes of keeping the estimated sea-level rise to no more than eight inches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast in Virginia, a bipartisan group of political leaders is forthrightly talking about the problem. Last week, they met to consider ways to adapt the low-lying Hampton Roads region in southeastern Virginia to science-based predictions that the seas will rise at least a foot in 30 years and five feet or more by the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The challenge is not theoretical,'' said Representative Scott Rigell, an Eastern Shore Republican. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, announced the creation of a new state commission on the ocean threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the Hampton Roads area is Norfolk, home to the world's largest naval base and a city that the White House warned in May is among the nation's most vulnerable to rising sea levels. ''This is a matter of national security,'' Alice Hill, a senior adviser to the National Security Council, said at the Virginia meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anxiety of commercial interests and homeowners along threatened coastal areas is understandable. But they are not helped by pandering politicians who choose to see no further than the span of their own careers -- and are shirking the challenge of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks as if Massachusetts made a serious mistake in 1994 when it let its two most prestigious (and costly) hospitals - Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, both affiliated with Harvard - merge into a single system known as Partners HealthCare,&quot; writes The New York Times editorial board. &quot;Investigations by the state attorney general's office have documented that the merger gave the hospitals enormous market leverage to drive up health care costs in the Boston area by demanding high reimbursements from insurers that were unrelated to the quality or complexity of care delivered.&quot; The board warns that the situation in Massachusetts &quot;offers a cautionary tale to other states about the risks of big hospital mergers and the limits of antitrust law as a tool to break up a powerful market-dominating system once it is entrenched.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other significant viewpoints from around the world:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post condemns what it calls Congress's &quot;head-in-the-sand&quot; approach to climate&nbsp;change. &quot;It's still not perfectly clear how sensitive the climate will be to a given increase in atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions,&quot; the editorial board writes. &quot;Nor is it perfectly clear how ongoing temperature change will affect complicated Earth systems. But these are not excuses for doing nothing, or too little, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&quot; The board demands immediate action from lawmakers: &quot;If Congress were the board of a large company, ignoring such a serious risk would give shareholders ample reason to fire every head-in-the-sand director. Voters might want to contemplate the analogy this November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nature, the pre-eminent journal for reporting scientific research, has&nbsp;had to retract&nbsp;two papers it published in January after mistakes were spotted in the figures,&quot; The Guardian reports. &quot;Some of the methods descriptions were found to be plagiarised and early attempts to replicate the work failed. This is the second time in recent weeks that the God-like omniscience that non-scientists often attribute to scientific journals was found to be exaggerated.&quot; The editorial board deplores the decline in rigor of peer-review processes at scholarly publications around the world: &quot;Scientific journals are guardians of the use of public money, the merit of research, and guarantors of the citizen's trust in science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Banks are under no legal obligation to do business with people who have been financially irresponsible,&quot; writes The Tampa Bay Times. &quot;Even so, the common practice of blacklisting customers who have made minor financial missteps and denying them access to basic banking is an abuse that hurts the economy, young adults and poor neighborhoods.&quot; The editorial board is critical of gratuitous punishments for customers who may bounce checks or overdraw on an account, &quot;especially when those people have repaid their debts,&quot; the editorial board writes. &quot;Banks should work with customers who have received what amounts to a financial scarlet letter for minor mismanagement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South China Morning Post calls on United States lawmakers to curtail what it calls &quot;indiscriminate spying&quot; on foreign nationals by the American government and its various security and intelligence agencies. The editorial board applauds the United States Supreme Court ruling that prevents police from searching cellphones without a warrant except under exceptional circumstances. &quot;It is a major victory in the fight for privacy that also has to be extended to the battle to curb unwelcome intrusions by U.S. government agencies.&quot; The board insists the United States Congress must enact laws to protect the rights and privacy of those without United States passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is one faint but real gleam of hope&quot; that has come out of the&nbsp;Syrian civil war,&nbsp;writesThe Globe and Mail. &quot;Last week, the final stocks of chemical weapons formerly held by the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad began to be destroyed at sea not far from Italy on an American government container ship. The Damascus regime no longer has any chemical arms, at least as far as is known to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.&quot; This is a major accomplishment: &quot;It is no easy matter to move weapons of mass destruction through a war zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOU won't hear it on your summer hike above the bird song and the soft applause of aspen leaves, but there's a heresy echoing through America's woods and wild places. It's a debate about how we should think about, and treat, our wilderness in the 21st century, one with real implications for the nearly 110 million acres of wild lands that we've set aside across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years ago this September, Congress passed the Wilderness Act, which created a national system of wilderness areas. Wilderness has been called the ''hard green line'' for the act's uncompromising language: Man will leave these places alone. As the law's drafter and spiritual father, Howard Zahniser, put it, ''we should be guardians, not gardeners.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 50, however, the Wilderness Act faces a midlife crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We now know that, thanks to climate&nbsp;change, we've left no place unmolested and inadvertently put our fingerprints on even the most unpeopled corners of the planet. This reality has pushed respected scientists to advocate what many wilderness partisans past and present would consider blasphemy: We need to rethink the Wilderness Act. We need to toss out the ''hands-off'' philosophy that has guided our stewardship for 50 years. We must replace it with a more nuanced, flexible approach -- including a willingness to put our hands on America's wildest places more, not less, if we're going to help them to adapt and thrive in the diminished future we've thrust upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A great example is Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California, most of which lies within the 595,000-acre Joshua Tree Wilderness. Up to 90 percent of the park's namesake trees could disappear by century's end, according to models that factor in expected warming. Should we let that happen as nature's atonement for our mistake? Or should park managers instead intervene in some way -- relocating trees to higher elevations to promote their survival, for instance, or finding or creating a hybrid species that can withstand the hotter temperatures and combating exotic grasses that increase the threat of fires?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such questions didn't exist in 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act. Then, the nemesis of wilderness was America's unchecked appetite -- for land, roads, mines, timber -- that gnawed away even at the boundaries of government-sanctioned ''primitive areas.'' Wilderness advocates craved permanence, in the form of legislation that took decision making away from capricious bureaucrats and political appointees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was at stake was nothing less than the wellspring of the American experiment itself. The historian Frederick Jackson Turner had pinned American democracy to wilderness; hacking a life from the wild made settlers ruggedly individual, self-assured and unwilling to suffer the yoke of any monarch. Wilderness, wrote the naturalist Aldo Leopold, is ''the very stuff America is made of.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law's definition of wilderness (maybe you've read it on a trailhead sign as you shouldered an overheavy backpack) reflects the idea of these places as a bulwark against humankind and its thirst for domination: ''where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' These places of ''primeval character'' should be maintained, the law says, to preserve their ''natural conditions.'' For the last half-century that let-it-be philosophy has carried the day, with few exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent decades, however, several pillars upon which the act was built have eroded. One is the idea of ''naturalness,'' that nature exists in some unadulterated state apart from humans. Work in paleoecology and other fields has shown that humans have shaped many of the ecosystems on the planet for thousands of years (and not always to their detriment). Research has also dismantled ideas about a stable, primeval world. Nature is always in flux.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes our jarring latest contribution: climate&nbsp;change, with all its rippling effects, as the planet continues to heat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with such change, ''there's increased recognition that the paradigm has to change,'' said Cat Hawkins Hoffman, the national climate&nbsp;change adaptation coordinator for the National Park Service, which manages 40 percent of American's wilderness acreage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The real conundrum is, how much manipulation in wilderness is acceptable in order to protect the values for which the wilderness was established,'' she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, we need to accept our role as reluctant gardeners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE 1964 law does provide some exceptions to its prohibitions against human interference, including in instances in which an area's managers consider intervention necessary to protect the wild lands or its creatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that context, intervention could take many forms. One strategy is simply to resist or forestall effects of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park is one of the most arresting places in the West, and it's important as the largest subalpine meadow in the Sierra Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the climate&nbsp;changes, the meadows, some of which lie in the Yosemite Wilderness, are being invaded by lodgepole pine. Keeping the meadows intact will require regular tree-cutting and possibly irrigation for species intolerant of drier conditions, according to David Cole, an emeritus scientist with the Forest Service's Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and co-editor of ''Beyond Naturalness,'' a 2010 book of scholarly essays about wilderness and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example: watering groves of California's giant sequoias to keep them alive if a future climate grows too dry for their survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While hardly long-term solutions, ''those can help buy us some time, and by buying time they can help us have that broader societal discussion'' and form policies so that what land managers do reflects what society wants, said Nate Stephenson, a research ecologist for the United States Geological Survey who works on the future of forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second approach is to intervene in a way that will make the landscape more resilient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, the past century of livestock grazing and fire suppression had turned much of the savanna-like landscape into one crowded with dense juniper and pinyon trees, with bare earth below. ''The rates of soil erosion had accelerated to damaging levels,'' as rains chewed away at the almost 3,000 archaeological sites that the monument was established to protect, said Craig Allen, a research ecologist with the survey's Jemez Mountains Field Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 15 years of study, in 2007 the park started taking chain saws to about 5,000 acres of land -- mostly in the monument's 23,000-acre Bandelier Wilderness -- cutting small trees and mulching the ground with their branches. The scale of the action ''was and remains unprecedented'' in wilderness, where engines aren't usually permitted, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worked. Rates of erosion have fallen by at least an order of magnitude, while native grasses and shrubs have increased threefold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think we improved the resilience of the system going forward,'' Brian Jacobs, a Bandelier botanist, said. ''The healthier a system is going into these changes, the more likely it is to be able to respond favorably.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thinning select wilderness forests could help in many places around the American Southwest where forest density has increased to more than 1,000 trees per acre from roughly 100 trees, Dr. Allen said. The remaining trees would be more likely to survive the hotter, thirstier future, while thinning could also reduce the likelihood of extremely destructive fires from which these landscapes struggle to recover, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another approach is to help nature adapt by giving it a hand in this strange new world -- accommodating the changes we want more than fighting those we don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gnarled by wind and weather, the whitebark pine grips the high slopes of the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies in such locations as the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana. Its fatty pine nuts are a staple of the threatened grizzly bear. Whitebark pine is rapidly declining in many places, however, because of invasive blister rust; the lack of fire in this ecosystem to promote the growth of new trees; and infestations by mountain pine beetles, probably aided by mellower winters. To help both beast and tree, some have proposed planting high slopes in places like ''the Bob'' with seeds from trees that show a resistance to the rust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still more controversial is assisted migration. Some species like the American pika, a small rodent-like mammal that lives among the rocks on high, cold mountains, can't do much to escape a warming world. It's been suggested that pikas -- or marmots, or certain butterflies whose narrow habitats are shrinking -- could be relocated to a more hospitable setting where they can, with luck, thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of intervention argue that the best thing we can do for wilderness is leave it alone. Opening up the Wilderness Act, they fear, will invite an attack on wild lands by the usual suspects: mining companies, give-back-the-land groups, Western red-state pols who pander to both. Then there are concerns like those of one Bureau of Land Management wilderness expert, who quoted to me the ecologist Frank Egler: ''Ecosystems are not only more complex than we think, they are more complex than we can think.'' Or to paraphrase the ecologist Peter Landres: Isn't it a fool's errand to try to manage what we don't fully understand, at a time when the context is changing and the precise future is uncertain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I share those concerns. And I cling to the romantic idea that, when I step into wilderness, I'm heading somewhere better than us -- that there are some places where we can still walk a few miles into red rock desert and when we get there, we'll find not a fracking pad or a Burger King but instead (Insert Your Deity Here). And it's true that if science has taught us one thing it's how little we know about nature. Yet as Dr. Stephenson counters, ''Ecosystems may be more complex than we can understand, but that doesn't mean that we don't have any understanding.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not intervene -- carefully, selectively, with humility -- in the places that need help the most, with an eye toward giving nature, and us, options? Perhaps we have different levels of wilderness, with different levels of human involvement, something even the founders of the Wilderness Society discussed, Dr. Cole told me, adding, ''What we need is a system with more diverse goals.'' Fears that we'll turn wilderness into a 110-million-acre garden miss the mark. If nothing else, lack of time, money and manpower will always constrain our efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to our most precious wild places, we need to flip the conversation from cause, to effect -- focusing on whether the change to the ecological system is ''acceptable or desirable'' and not whether humans helped nudge it there, according to Richard Hobbs, former editor of the journal Restoration Ecology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmental titans of the 20th century -- John Muir, Marshall, Leopold, Zahniser -- handed us an awesome responsibility in America's wilderness legacy. Ironically, it may take us committing a necessary apostasy to show how much we truly revere these wild places.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do Americans understand the scientific consensus about issues like climate&nbsp;change and evolution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least for a substantial portion of the public, it seems like the answer is no. The Pew Research Center, for instance, found that 33 percent of the public believes ''Humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time'' and 26 percent think there is not ''solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades.'' Unsurprisingly, beliefs on both topics are divided along religious and partisan lines. For instance, 46 percent of Republicans said there is not solid evidence of global warming, compared with 11 percent of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of surveys like these, scientists and advocates have concluded that many people are not aware of the evidence on these issues and need to be provided with correct information. That's the impulse behind efforts like the campaign to publicize the fact that 97 percent of climate scientists believe human activities are causing global warming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new study, a Yale Law School professor, Dan Kahan, finds that the divide over belief in evolution between more and less religious people is wider among people who otherwise show familiarity with math and science, which suggests that the problem isn't a lack of information. When he instead tested whether respondents knew the theory of evolution, omitting mention of belief, there was virtually no difference between more and less religious people with high scientific familiarity. In other words, religious people knew the science; they just weren't willing to say that they believed in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kahan's study suggests that more people know what scientists think about high-profile scientific controversies than polls suggest; they just aren't willing to endorse the consensus when it contradicts their political or religious views. This finding helps us understand why my colleagues and I have found that factual and scientific evidence is often ineffective at reducing misperceptions and can even backfire on issues like weapons of mass destruction, health care reform and vaccines. With science as with politics, identity often trumps the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what should we do? One implication of Mr. Kahan's study and other research in this field is that we need to try to break the association between identity and factual beliefs on high-profile issues -- for instance, by making clear that you can believe in human-induced climate&nbsp;change and still be a conservative Republican like former Representative Bob Inglis or an evangelical Christian like the climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we also need to reduce the incentives for elites to spread misinformation to their followers in the first place. Once people's cultural and political views get tied up in their factual beliefs, it's very difficult to undo regardless of the messaging that is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be possible for institutions to help people set aside their political identities and engage with science more dispassionately under certain circumstances, especially at the local level. Mr. Kahan points, for instance, to the relatively inclusive and constructive deliberations that were conducted among citizens in Southeast Florida about responding to climate&nbsp;change. However, this experience may be hard to replicate -- on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, another threatened coastal area, the debate over projected sea level rises has already become highly polarized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deeper problem is that citizens participate in public life precisely because they believe the issues at stake relate to their values and ideals, especially when political parties and other identity-based groups get involved -- an outcome that is inevitable on high-profile issues. Those groups can help to mobilize the public and represent their interests, but they also help to produce the factual divisions that are one of the most toxic byproducts of our polarized era. Unfortunately, knowing what scientists think is ultimately no substitute for actually believing it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mine's groundbreaking, in a state forest this year, inspired a veteran to stand in front of a bulldozer and a music teacher to chain himself to a piece of excavation equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the project had an unlikely financial backer in the United States, whose infusion of cash helped set it in motion: Tom Steyer, the most influential environmentalist in American politics, who has vowed to spend $100 million this year to defeat candidates who oppose policies to combat climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, emerged this election season as the green-minded answer to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the patrons of conservative Republican politics, after vowing that he would sell off his investments in companies that generate fossil fuels like coal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an examination of those investments shows that even after his highly public divestment, the coal-related projects his firm bankrolled will generate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years, if not decades, to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 15 years, Mr. Steyer's fund, Farallon Capital Management, has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expected life span of those facilities, some of which may run through 2030, could cloud Mr. Steyer's image as an environmental savior and the credibility of his clean-energy message, which has won him access to the highest levels of American government. A few weeks ago, Mr. Steyer, 56, joined President Obama for an intimate group dinner at the White House that ran into the early morning hours, according to people told of the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times examined the operations of coal-mining companies in which Farallon invested or to which it lent money during Mr. Steyer's stewardship, which coincided with growing demand and prices for coal. Together, those mines have increased their annual production by about 70 million tons since they received money from the hedge fund, according to corporate records, government data and interviews with industry experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is more than the amount of coal consumed annually by Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am disappointed, I have to say,'' said Dale Jamieson, a professor of environmental studies at New York University, who said he admired Mr. Steyer's campaign to curb climate&nbsp;change. When it comes to large-scale investments in coal, Professor Jamieson said, ''you can't undo what you've done in the past.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer sold his ownership stake in Farallon in late 2012, but he has not cut ties with it entirely. He remains a passive investor, his aides said, though they declined to describe the size of his investment. Employees at Farallon screen out any fossil-fuel-related holdings from his portfolio, and he no longer earns a share of the profits from the fund, the aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farallon is still invested in carbon-generating industries, and the aides declined to say whether Mr. Steyer had asked it to sell those holdings, a request that would presumably hold significant sway given his role as a founder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian mine, known as Maules Creek, illustrates the complexities of Mr. Steyer's efforts to distance himself. Farallon was a major investor in a 2009 deal aimed at developing the mine, lending an Australian entrepreneur hundreds of millions of dollars to buy out the previous owner, according to people involved in the transaction. Eventually, the entrepreneur took the mine public, turning Farallon's investment into a large profit. An executive involved in the original deal estimated that Farallon earned tens of millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farallon remains an investor in Maules Creek to this day. Mining at the site, expected to start in 2015, will last up to 30 years, yield as much as 13 million tons of coal a year and generate about 30 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, according to Ian Lowe, the former head of the School of Science at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. (The company that owns the mine, Whitehaven Coal, disputes the carbon dioxide projection.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Mr. Steyer's reputation as an active environmentalist, Australian opponents of the mine were startled to learn of his firm's role as an early investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's gobsmacking,'' Philip Spark, president of the Northern Inland Council for the Environment, a nonprofit trying to stop construction of the mine, said in a telephone interview. ''It's amazing that such a person could have been involved in this project.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Carnegie, an investment banker in Australia who was involved in the Maules Creek deal, said he could sense even then that Mr. Steyer was struggling to reconcile his motivations as a profit-seeking investor with his growing anxieties about the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the investment was financially irresistible. ''It was a hard thing to turn down,'' Mr. Carnegie said. ''It was a huge winning bet for Farallon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why Mr. Steyer had allowed Farallon to pursue such investments in recent years, Heather Wong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Steyer's political organization, NextGen Climate, said, ''Given how major global funds are structured, they are by definition invested in every sector of the economy, which is why Tom stepped down in 2012.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Steyer founded NextGen Climate in 2013, the environmental movement found what it had long lacked and sorely wanted: a determined political combatant with a willingness to raise and spend campaign money at a level never before seen by traditional environmental groups. An Upper East Side native educated at Yale and Stanford, Mr. Steyer glided through jobs at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in the 1980s before plunging into the relatively new world of hedge funds. Since he founded it in 1986, Farallon -- named for a set of rocky islands off the California coast -- has grown to manage as much as $37 billion, from about $15 million in the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the early 2000s, the fund offered large, typically high-interest loans to companies seeking to buy undervalued coal mines in Indonesia, which was still rebounding from the Asian financial crisis. The buyouts proved profitable for Farallon, but they also encouraged the new owners of the mines to increase coal production in order to generate revenue to repay the loans, according to executives who participated in the buyouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, for example, Farallon lent at least $60 million to a group of investors buying an Indonesian coal-mining company called Berau, giving the fund a right to a stake in the company, according to people involved in the deal. Within a few years, Berau's value had doubled, delivering a hefty return for Farallon. Berau quickly sped up its operations: Its coal production soared to 20 million tons in 2012 from about nine million tons in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Suyama, a former Merrill Lynch banker who was involved in the Berau buyout, said Farallon was ''like an anchor in the Indonesian coal industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''By drawing money to an overlooked sector,'' he said, ''they helped expand the coal industry there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with those in coal mining, Mr. Steyer's investments in coal-fired power will reverberate far into the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farallon invested in a subsidiary of Indiabulls, an Indian financial conglomerate, in 2008, just as the subsidiary began expanding into coal-fired power. Two years later, Indiabulls began construction on two massive coal-fired power plants: the 2,700-megawatt Amravati plant in central India and the 1,350-megawatt Nasik plant outside Mumbai. When completed, Amravati is expected to be one of the largest coal-fired power plants in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiabulls has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with a government-owned electric utility, locking in two decades of carbon pollution. It took a similar approach in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, Farallon provided funds for the sale of Meiya Power, an electric utility that operates four large coal-fired power plants, which collectively produce about 7,000 megawatts of power. Combined, the completed Indiabulls and Meiya plants will produce about 60 million tons of carbon pollution a year, according to Dallas Burtraw, an analyst at Resources for the Future, a research organization in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican candidates Mr. Steyer is targeting in this year's midterm elections said such investments deeply undermined his cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It blows a hole in his credibility,'' said Representative Cory Gardner, a Senate candidate in Colorado, whose Democratic rival, Senator Mark Udall, has benefited from $100,000 from Mr. Steyer's political organization. ''You can't claim you are a great environmentalist and invest in the very same technologies you are railing against.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican leaders and their allies are drawing up plans to cast Mr. Steyer as a hypocrite. In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, a Senate candidate, said he intended to portray his opponent, Senator Kay Hagan, and Mr. Steyer as ''people who say one thing and do another.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, conservative groups and blogs are scouring Mr. Steyer's business record. One blog, Power Line, has written extensively about Farallon's work in the coal industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews, several prominent environmentalists argued that Mr. Steyer's unrivaled spending to support climate-change policies outweighed the impact of the carbon pollution unleashed by his past investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is precisely what we want people to do: sell investments in fossil fuels and get to work solving the problem of climate&nbsp;change,'' said Bill McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, which pushes financial institutions to divest from fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters point to the $25 million campaign Mr. Steyer organized four years ago to defeat a California ballot initiative that would have gutted the state's landmark climate-change law. The law remained in place and is projected to cut about 30 million tons of carbon emissions by 2020. This year, Mr. Steyer plans to spend four times as much in support of Mr. Obama's plan to reduce emissions from about 600 coal-fired power plants -- a plan expected to eliminate 220 million tons of carbon pollution a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detractors see hypocrisy: As coal linked to Mr. Steyer's previous investments burns in Asian power plants, he is spending a fortune earned from those investments to pursue a green agenda that would shutter similar plants in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If my side wins, it will create real costs for ordinary working people,'' said Professor Jamieson of N.Y.U. ''Hits to their welfare will not be compensated by stacks of money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Mr. Steyer, he said, ''they won't have options.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Wong, the spokeswoman for Mr. Steyer's political organization, said Mr. Steyer had invested heavily both in creating jobs in the emerging clean-energy industry and in training workers for those positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Australia, environmentalists wondered what Mr. Steyer had to say about the giant new coal mine financed by his hedge fund. Would he try to stop it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair Palese, an environmental leader in Australia, urged Mr. Steyer to ''get Farallon to step back and get out of this investment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It could be 30 years of coal production,'' she said. ''How can we keep doing this?''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a friendly audience of environmental advocates last week, President Obama mocked members of Congress who ''duck the question,'' as he put it, of whether climate&nbsp;change is real by saying that they are not scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I mean, I'm not a scientist either,'' the president told the League of Conservation Voters in Washington. ''But I've got this guy, John Holdren. He's a scientist.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line got a laugh, in part because Mr. Holdren, a physicist and the White House science adviser since the beginning of the administration, is hardly just a ''guy'' -- he has had one of the more prominent careers in academia and policy making of any scientist in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also acknowledged a truth: Mr. Holdren has this president's ear, perhaps more than any White House science adviser in recent memory, at a time when climate&nbsp;change has been thrust to the forefront of national politics and could help shape Mr. Obama's legacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren's influence can be seen in many of the administration's policies, including its biggest on climate&nbsp;change -- the plan to cut power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''John was right at the heart'' of the deliberations, said the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of his four-decade career, Mr. Holdren, 70, has focused on climate&nbsp;change and its perils, and he has not been shy about voicing his opinions. ''He's somebody that people want to hear from,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''And even if he weren't, he'd be sure he was heard from.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren, whose views and pivotal role in the administration have put him in the cross hairs of critics, also spearheaded the most recent National Climate Assessment report, which painted a stark picture of the impact climate&nbsp;change is having on the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a very substantial project for him,'' said John D. Podesta, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and now a counselor to Mr. Obama. ''Both in terms of ensuring the quality and validity of the report, as well as trying to explain it first to the president and then to the public.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even some people who admire his intelligence and ability to explain the science of climate&nbsp;change say his passion for the issue can work against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He is a zealot,'' said John W. Rowe, the former chief executive of the energy company Exelon, who was a co-chairman with Mr. Holdren of a panel on energy policy in the 2000s. ''If you start off skeptical of his science because of the eminence of his zeal, you can be confirmed in your skepticism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren's zeal, and his tendency to present somewhat alarming visions of the future, have stirred controversy. During his Senate confirmation hearings in 2009, critics pointed out a textbook of which he was an author in the 1970s that examined the threat of overpopulation and discussed potential ways to avoid it, including forcing pregnant single women to undergo abortions and adding chemicals to drinking water to make people infertile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Compulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying,'' the book said. It continued, ''A far better choice, in our view, is to expand the use of milder methods of influencing family size preferences, while redoubling efforts to ensure that the means of birth control, including abortion and sterilization, are accessible to every human being on Earth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearings, Mr. Holdren said that he had not endorsed any coercive population-control measures and that such activities were not a proper role of government. He was confirmed unanimously, but the issue has been kept alive on conservative talk radio and blogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted on the subject during a question-and-answer session at a speech last year, Mr. Holdren responded testily: ''I'm kind of tired of that question. Folks should go back and look at the book.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, Mr. Holdren was featured in a short video meant to rebut claims that a recent spell of extreme cold weather disproved global warming. He cited ''a growing body of evidence'' that he said suggested such cold spells could increase as the Arctic grows warmer. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group that is skeptical about climate&nbsp;change, demanded a correction, arguing that several recent scientific papers had disproved Mr. Holdren's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, among climate scientists the issue of a link between Arctic warming and cold spells is still far from resolved. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which Mr. Holdren leads, said it stood by the accuracy of the video but added, ''there will be continuing debate about exactly what is happening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren is not reluctant to defend himself. At a hearing in February, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, confronted him with earlier testimony by Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist, that Mr. Holdren had issued misleading statements about the link between climate&nbsp;change and Western droughts. Mr. Holdren responded that Mr. Pielke's comments ''were not representative of mainstream views,'' and a few days later went further, issuing a rare point-by-point rebuttal that accused Mr. Pielke of being the misleading one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren, whom the White House declined to make available to be interviewed for this article, has been the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, among other public-policy appointments, and as a leader of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs he delivered the acceptance speech when the group shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for its work on nuclear disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Clinton administration, he served on the president's council of advisers on science and technology, but he refused all entreaties to become the science adviser. When Mr. Obama was elected, however, he persuaded Mr. Holdren to take the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing that caught the Obama team's attention, according to some who were there at the time, was a 2008 appearance on ''Late Show With David Letterman'' in which Mr. Holdren discussed the science behind climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holdren meets with the president regularly, but he also advises on a less formal basis. Mr. McDonough said the president often reads about scientific subjects in the newspaper or online and sends his staff notes that say, ''I need to know what Holdren thinks on this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the involvement in policy, Mr. Holdren can still be a geeky scientist. Rosina M. Bierbaum, a professor at the University of Michigan who sits on the president's council, recalled that during the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, ''he would actually sit down and try to do some of the calculations'' to better understand the unfolding disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He likes to get into the weeds and check the numbers,'' Ms. Bierbaum said. ''But he can also think strategically.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also likes to apply scientific analysis to some of his favorite activities, like saltwater fly-fishing, colleagues say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite disagreeing with Mr. Holdren on some climate issues, Mr. Rowe, the energy panel co-chairman, said they worked well together. ''He knows the studies backwards and forwards, and is as articulate on them as anyone I've ever met,'' he said. ''And he tolerates others reasonably well, and laughs at himself at least a little.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">745 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Marine scientists see parrotfish protection as a vital step toward restoration of Caribbean reefs after decades of devastation. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coral reefs in much of the Caribbean have been badly degraded in recent decades by die-offs of algae-munching sea urchins, high-temperature bleaching events, overfishing, invasive species and runoff from fast-paced coastal development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a comprehensive international report released this week charts a guardedly optimistic path to recovery - starting with conservation of an unlikely reef champion - the parrotfish. The report, prepared over three years by 90 experts, was produced by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the United Nations Environment Program (news release).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This excerpt from the executive summary makes the parrotfish point: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coral reef health requires an ecological balance of corals and algae in which herbivory is a key element. Populations of parrotfish are a critical component of that herbivory, particularly since the&nbsp;decline of Diadema sea urchins in the early 1980s; the main causes of mortality of parrotfish are the use of fishing techniques such as spearfishing and, particularly, the use of fish traps.... [M]anagement action to address&nbsp;overfishing at the national and local levels can have a direct positive impact on reef health&nbsp;now and for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found no statistically significant evidence of a measurable impact of periods of extreme heat on coral reef fate (search for the phrase &quot;extreme warming events&quot; in the report summary to get the details).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's an excerpt from the report summary capturing the overarching opportunities in shifting fisheries practices and management:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our results contradict much of the rhetoric about the importance of ocean warming, disease, and hurricanes on coral reefs and emphasize the critical importance of historical perspective for coral reef management and conservation. The threats of climate&nbsp;change and ocean acidification loom increasingly ominously for the future, but local stressors including an explosion in tourism, overfishing, and the resulting increase in macroalgae have been the major drivers of the catastrophic decline of Caribbean corals up until today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this means is that smart decisions and actions on a local basis could make an enormous difference for increased resilience and wellbeing of Caribbean coral reefs and the people and enterprises that depend upon them. Thus, four major recommendations emerge from this report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Adopt robust conservation and fisheries management strategies that lead to the restoration of parrotfish populations, including the listing of the parrotfish in relevant annexes of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife of the UNEP Caribbean Environment Program. A recommendation to this effect was passed unanimously at the October 2013 International Coral Reef Initiative Meeting in Belize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Simplify and standardize monitoring of Caribbean reefs and make the results available on an annual basis to facilitate adaptive management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Foster communication and exchange of information so that local authorities can benefit from the experiences of others elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Develop and implement adaptive legislation and regulations to ensure that threats to coral reefs are systematically addressed, particularly threats posed by fisheries, tourism and coastal development as determined by established indicators of reef health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Jackson, a lead author of the report, wrote a compelling piece on the findings for the Ocean Portal blog of the National Museum of Natural History that includes this vital line, which is in sync with my assertion that we can chart a &quot;good&quot; path in this turbulent Anthropocene era:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people say that climate&nbsp;change has already doomed coral reefs. But the report shows that the loss of parrotfishes and other seaweed-eating grazers has been far more important than climate&nbsp;change for Caribbean reef destruction so far. While it is true that climate&nbsp;change poses an enormous risk for the future because of coral bleaching and more acidic oceans, the fact is that reefs protected from overfishing, excessive coastal development and pollution are more resilient to these stresses. Even if we could somehow make climate&nbsp;change disappear tomorrow, these reefs would continue their decline. We must immediately address the grazing problem for the reefs to stand any chance of surviving future climatic shifts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Risky Business report frames climate change as risk issue with price tag. Does it indicate that the financial community is beginning to take climate change seriously?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after the publication of new figures revealing that May 2014 was the hottest globally since records began in 1880, came the publication of a new report, Risky Business: The Economic Risks of Climate&nbsp;Change in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The product of a bipartisan group, bringing together the former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg, three former US Treasury Secretaries (Hank Paulson, Robert Rubin and George Schultz), and the billionaire investor Tom Steyer, Risky Business shows the growing realisation that tackling climate&nbsp;change is both an economic imperative and an enormous opportunity. The publication of the report is yet another indication that the financial community is beginning to take climate&nbsp;change seriously.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report came hot on the heels of a series of speeches, reports and policy initiatives that have pushed climate&nbsp;change back up the agenda in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first signs of this came early in the year with president Obama's State of the Union address, in which he stated &quot;Climate&nbsp;change is a fact. And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.&quot; This was subsequently reinforced when the president delivered a major policy speech in May at West Point Military Academy claiming that fighting climate&nbsp;change was every bit as important to the US' national security as stopping terrorism or working to stop countries from obtaining nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early May, the National Climate Assessment set out the dangers of a changing climate that has moved from distant threat to present-day danger, with no American left unscathed. And in early June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the Clean Power Plan, which will require power plants to reduce carbon emissions 30% below 2005 levels by the year 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focusing on the public health agenda, the EPA estimates the emissions reductions will avoid up to 6,000 premature deaths, 140-150,000 asthma attacks in children, and nearly 500,000 sick days. The Clean Power Plan has public health and climate benefits worth an estimated $55bn to $93bn per year in 2030, which it says far outweigh the costs of $7.3bn to $8.8bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Risky Business report is different; it's a deliberate attempt to depoliticise the issue of climate&nbsp;change, it frames climate&nbsp;change as a risk issue and talks about the economic costs in a US context: damage to coastal property and infrastructure from rising sea levels and increased storm surge, climate-driven changes in agricultural production and the impact of higher temperatures on labour productivity public health and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a powerful message because it links to people's own lives and livelihoods, made real because of the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on the east coast and the ongoing droughts in California and the midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the headline findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coastal property and infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we continue on our current path, by 2050 between $66bn and $106bn worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide, with $238bn to $507bn worth of property below sea level by 2100.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absent agricultural adaptation, if we continue on our current path, national commodity crop production (corn, soy, wheat and cotton) could decline by 14% by mid-century and up to 42% by late century as extreme heat spreads across the middle of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact of higher temperatures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the middle of this century, the average American will likely experience 27 to 50 days each year with temperatures reaching more than 95&deg;F [35C] -up to more than three times the average number of 95&deg;F days we've seen over the past 30 years ... Demand for electricity for air conditioning will surge in those parts of the country facing the most extreme temperature increases, straining regional generation and transmission capacity and driving up costs for consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate&nbsp;Change published in 2006, the Risky Business report presents a compelling case that business as usual is not an option and, in the words of Tom Steyer &quot;confirms what many of us have long suspected: The longer we wait to address the growing risks of climate&nbsp;change, the more it will cost us all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, is there a role of investors in the climate&nbsp;change debate? This year alone, investors have filed more than 140 climate-related shareholder resolutions with US companies. At the same time, a coalition of investors called the Carbon Asset Risk (CAR) initiative, coordinated by Ceres and the Carbon Tracker initiative, with support from the Global Investor Coalition on Climate&nbsp;Change, launched a coordinated effort to encourage 45 of the world's largest fossil fuel companies to address the financial risks posed by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is clear that investors could be doing more. There is a major opportunity for investors to demonstrate that they are increasingly ready for serious climate action from policymakers ahead of the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit in September 2014, which is anticipated to build momentum for a strong global climate agreement in 2015.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;China is spending a lot of money to address its air pollution problem, but some scientists say that may not produce the results the government expects. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scared of a big problem, a government throws money at it. Hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet the money doesn't truly help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a scenario that may be facing China as it tries to rid itself of severe air pollution, a prominent Harvard University scientist said after a two-day, closed-door symposium in Shanghai attended by leading American and Chinese scientists and pollution experts, including meteorologists, chemists and economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government here is facing a very serious problem. I think they're scared to death of the problem,&quot; said Chris P. Nielsen, the executive director of  at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which organized the Shanghai event last month, China 2035: Energy, Climate and Development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's the difficulty of picking apart the chemistry of air pollution. There's how the pollution interacts with local topography and meteorology. There's the policy inflexibility rooted in China's grand, bureaucratic Five-Year Plans, which may reduce the country's ability to adapt to scientific findings as they emerge - essential to solving the problem, Mr. Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet something even bigger may be at work: climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, China is spending a lot of money trying to reduce the pollution that regularly renders large areas of the country a miasma of haze, causing increased morbidity and mortality. It is upgrading vehicle emission standards. It is even reported to be using drones to detect factories that violate emissions laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not quite that it's not going to work. It's, 'How well is it going to work?' &quot; said Mr. Nielsen, speaking by telephone in Beijing shortly before returning to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has complex causes,&quot; he said. &quot;And it's true if you try to shut down emissions, it should help. But that may not be as effective as they think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the climate hypothesis (warning, necessarily simplified): As the &nbsp;earth warms, the high-pressure system of cold air known as the Siberian High that influences many places, including &nbsp;China, weakens.&nbsp;That means there is less wind to blow away the smog and stagnant air where pollutants accumulate and interact. That leads to increased haze, cutting sunlight's access to the ground, leaving it cooler.&nbsp;The effect reduces the heat that produces convectional rainfall that could clear the air. It's not so much a vicious circle as a vicious pretzel, or even knot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, however much money a government may spend on local measures, the realities of chemistry, meteorology and climate mean that it might not solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nielsen cautioned that for now, the &quot;climate hypothesis&quot; is just that - a hypothesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very, very active area of research,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a lot of reason to think there's some real substance to this. But it's an ongoing question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Arctic is warming faster than the mid-latitudes and tropics,&quot; he said. &quot;Because the temperature differences are declining between the Arctic&quot; and elsewhere, &quot;it follows in a gross sense that you have increasing stagnation, essentially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to specific concerns over the Siberian High, &quot;the evidence is a little bit mixed. It's quite clear that the really severe episodes&quot; of air pollution in China, especially in the north, &quot;definitely have as part of their cause a meteorological phenomenon, more inversion, more stagnation. And possibly it's a credible surmise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a study published in late June in Nature Climate&nbsp;Change, a journal, researchers at Stanford University said that &quot;anthropogenic,&quot; or human-originated, &quot;climate&nbsp;change is likely to alter the level of pollutant management required to meet future air quality targets.&quot; Put another way: The global warming we're causing is going to lead to more pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, poor air quality is causing up to 2.6 to 4.4 million premature deaths per year worldwide, they wrote in the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese participants at the Shanghai symposium declined to discuss the matter on the record, saying pollution was a &quot;sensitive&quot; issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Nielsen and others said that while pollution's complex interactions of chemical, meteorological and climatological aspects were being increasingly studied in China, the community of people doing so was small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the environmental science, in the West as well as in China, is just getting to the point of disentangling the chemical components&quot; of PM 2.5, the fine particles &quot;that are actually causing these health effects, the premature mortality and morbidity,&quot; he said.                      </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Environmental Protection Agency published in June its new rules to combat carbon emissions from power plants, the American political class lit up in debates over what this meant for the country's carbon emissions, its coal industry and its economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a more relevant discussion was taking place some 7,000 miles away. In Beijing, He Jiankun, an academic and deputy director of China's Advisory Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change, told a conference that China, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, would for the first time put ''an absolute cap'' on its emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments, and the brief flurry set off over whether they represented government policy, highlight a little-appreciated feature of the long-running, often acrimonious debate over how to slow climate&nbsp;change. The most pressing issue is not whether the United States will manage to wean itself from coal, or even about how quickly the American economy can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most pressing issue is to what extent and under which conditions China will participate in the global effort to combat climate&nbsp;change. Any hopes that American commitments to cut carbon emissions will have a decisive impact on climate&nbsp;change rely on the assumption that China will reciprocate and deliver aggressive emission cuts of its own.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well known that preventing a climate catastrophe requires China's participation: The country accounts for over a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Over the next 20 years, China's CO2 emissions will grow by an amount roughly equal to the United States' total emissions today, according to the latest baseline forecast by the Energy Information Administration, released last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the scale of China's challenge is less well grasped. It might be best understood by slicing the growth of CO2 emissions into four driving forces: the expansion of the population, the growth in people's incomes, the amount of energy needed to produce a dollar of income, and the amount of CO2 spewed for each unit of energy used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even assuming that China's population does not grow at all over the next 30 years, that the energy efficiency of its economy increases at a faster pace than most developed and developing countries and that it manages to decarbonize its energy sources faster than pretty much anybody else, China would still be emitting a lot more carbon in 2040 than it does today, according to E.I.A. calculations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To achieve a rate of economic growth per person of 5.7 percent a year -- which is only about half the pace China experienced in the last 10 years -- China's CO2 emissions would soar to almost 15 billion tons in 2040, up from 8 billion in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China could presumably decarbonize faster. While the Chinese government has not yet imposed a cap, it has acknowledged the need to rein in rising carbon emissions. Still, improving on these forecasts will not be an easy call. At best, they will require a lot of new technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, it could accept a substantially slower pace of economic growth. But considering that the average Chinese earns about one-fifth as much as the average American, the government in Beijing is unlikely to follow this path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the United States or anybody else do anything to speed China down a low-carbon path?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads of state from around the world will be gathering in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to start a new international climate agreement, due to be signed at a summit meeting in Paris next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They come off a big defeat. In 2009, the Copenhagen conference on climate&nbsp;change broke down to a large extent because big developing countries like China refused to accept legally binding commitments on emission cuts, which might constrain their future development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the crucial question remains the same: how to meaningfully bring aboard countries like China or India. The debate appears stuck in more or less the same place, with countries arguing over who is responsible for what. How much of the burden should be shouldered by rich countries -- which grew rich while spewing carbon into the air in past decades? How much by the fast-growing developing countries -- where emissions are growing fastest? Who is to blame for the carbon emitted in making the latest gadget, the developing country that made it or the developed country that bought it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, issued in April, suggested several ways to allot responsibilities. If one starts counting in the 18th century and counts only emissions from industry and energy generation, the United States is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gases that humanity has put into the air. China, by contrast, is responsible for 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if one starts counting in 1990, when the world first became aware that CO2 was a problem, and includes greenhouse gases emitted from changes in land use, the United States is responsible for only 18 percent, and China's share rises to 15 percent. Rich and poor countries, unsurprisingly, disagree on the proper measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the United States seems to have learned from past climate negotiation mistakes. In 1997, the Senate blew up the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon emissions even before it was finalized -- formally urging the White House not to sign it unless it included legal commitments by developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's new rules on power plants, by contrast, are not contingent on the actions of anybody else. By unilaterally offering up American emission cuts, they might get more in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries left Copenhagen without legally binding emissions targets. But that didn't mean nothing was achieved. Big emitters of carbon dioxide made nonbinding, voluntary offers to reduce the CO2 they pumped into the air. And though not all of these offers will be met, this voluntary, unilateral approach may offer a promising path for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States pledged then that greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 would be 17 percent lower than in 2005, which, compared with the business-as-usual path, amounts to a reduction of one billion tons. Trevor Houser, who heads the energy practice at the Rhodium Group, an economic modeling firm, calculates that this American commitment was crucial in unlocking commitments by other countries worth two billion to five billion tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is not a bad leverage ratio,'' he said. ''So we know that U.S. leadership elicits reciprocal action from other countries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may be a useful precedent for future negotiations. After all, countries cannot really commit to cutting carbon emissions in the way that they commit to cut tariff barriers on trade. Forcing legally binding tariffs might discourage countries from shooting for ambitious goals. Public voluntary commitments that are attached to a rigorous and transparent monitoring process could be more effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is nonetheless far from clear whether this kind of approach gets us where we want to be. Not everybody will meet their Copenhagen pledges. Japan, which unplugged its nuclear energy after the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, will fall behind. So will Canada and Australia, whose new conservative governments have lost interest in the pledges of their predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is only halfway there, helped along by a deep economic recession that cut into the demand for energy. And it will require more than the current rules on power plants to get there. ''We need more action,'' said Kate Larsen, a former climate negotiator at the State Department who now is director of Climate&nbsp;Change at the Rhodium Group. ''It's not in the bag.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most importantly, the Copenhagen commitments are nowhere near big enough. China, for instance, committed to improve its carbon efficiency but made no promise on carbon emissions. It must offer more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials are confident that offering unilateral emissions cuts can persuade the Chinese to offer real commitments that might have a chance to keep global temperatures in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the incentive goes only so far. For China, the existential question remains whether it can simultaneously decarbonize and grow. If it cannot do both things at once, chances are it will choose the second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, shortly after his words toured the world, Mr. He, the official on the Chinese climate panel, issued a clarification: He was not announcing policy in Beijing. ''I'm not a government official, and I don't represent the government,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government is still figuring out how much it can afford to participate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry M. Paulson Jr. (''The Coming Climate Crash,'' Sunday Review, June 22) outlined several potential actions that might be taken to fight climate&nbsp;change. Any list of how to help reduce carbon emissions should include preserving our existing fleet of nuclear energy plants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of our existing nuclear energy plants face a host of challenges that threaten their continued operation through the end of their existing licenses, and one of the best things we can do to ensure the production of carbon-free energy is to make sure that they stay open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear plants produce nearly a fifth of the United States' total power production, but in 2013 accounted for an overwhelming 63 percent of the country's carbon-free energy. Nuclear energy also prevented 589 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2013, equal to the carbon emissions emitted by 113 million passenger cars -- more than all passenger cars in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we debate new methods of reducing carbon emissions, it's critical that we work to ensure that nuclear energy plants, existing assets that are already helping to manage climate&nbsp;change, are preserved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire population of Antarctica's famous emperor penguins could fall by a third by the end of the century because of disappearing sea ice, putting them at risk of extinction, say researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in the journal Nature Climate&nbsp;Change, scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts say their findings justify protecting emperor penguins under the Endangered Species Act - as the US already does for polar bears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also call for marine reserves to be created to buffer the fish stocks penguins need to survive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The population is declining. Unless something changes to stop that, the population will go into extinction,&quot; said Hal Caswell, one of the authors of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a top predator in Antarctica, penguins are mainly at risk from climate&nbsp;change, which is melting the sea ice. The loss of ice is reducing the supply of krill, the tiny, shrimp-like crustaceans that populate the Southern Ocean and are the emperor penguins' main food source. Young krill feed off algae living in the sea ice. When the ice goes, so do the krill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes in the ice around Antarctica may - in the short term - boost some of the emperor penguin populations, especially along the Ross Sea, the researchers said. Sea ice off the western coast of Antarctica has been on the increase, because of wind conditions and the break-up of glaciers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by 2100, all 45 known emperor penguin colonies of Antarctica will be on the decline because of loss of sea ice. Those located on the coasts of the eastern Weddell Sea and the western Indian Ocean will show the sharpest drops. Nine colonies are projected to be &quot;quasi-extinct&quot;, the researchers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other studies have raised the threat to emperor penguins under climate&nbsp;change, suggesting the ordinarily hardy animals, which grow to more than a metre high, are susceptible to rising heat. Smaller penguins such as the chinstrap and Adelie are also at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers from the University of Minnesota last week suggested some emperor penguin colonies might be able to move location and so be better equipped to adapt to changing ice conditions than previously thought. But the Woods Hole researchers said their study was the first to forecast a population decline across all of Antarctica. It also suggested there was little scope for penguins to adapt to the changing ice conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers said the findings called for urgent measures to help the penguins survive - such as legal protection and the creation of marine reserves off Antarctica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Implementing a marine protected area in the Ross Sea could help buy time to avoid extinction and to put in place needed conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies,&quot; Stephanie Jenouvrier, lead author and a scientist at Woods Hole, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A marine reserve would potentially put large areas of ocean off-limits to fishing - reducing the pressure on krill stocks and giving the penguin a better chance of survival, said Andrea Kavanagh, director of global penguin conservation for the Pew Charitable Trusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given this new research, and what we already know about global temperatures warming and the changing climate, one of the things we should do immediately is put a marine reserve in place so we can make sure that we are not fishing in areas where the penguins need to forage for food,&quot; she said. &quot;It is one way of eliminating one more threat to the penguins.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Dejevsky: First thoughts: This is his country as much as ours, and doesn't appear to be an especially successful lobbyist, so why shouldn't he air his views?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, what is Prince Charles supposed to do with his time as he waits for the top job? Not, apparently, to play any part in day to day policy-making, still less to try to influence those actually elected to do it. Revelations that the heir to the throne has stuck his oar in - or had &quot;quiet words&quot; - with government ministers over the years on matters as diverse and weighty as climate&nbsp;change and grammar schools have unleashed an outcry about the proper role of a prince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consensus appears to be that before he is anointed king, he has no right to say anything, in public or in private, that might be considered even tangentially political. He does not, it may be construed, command even the residual powers of a monarch that would allow him to advise, encourage or warn a government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can swan around the Commonwealth cutting ribbons; he can present awards at Buckingham Palace. For the rest, though, he would be well advised to retreat with his paintbox to the Lake District, build some dry stone walls on his west country estates, or, should the urge to do something more energetic become too strong, find some mates for a game of polo. At the extreme, he might stalk a stag or two in the Highlands, but he should be careful not to kill one, or if he does, to do it well out of sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such strictures are not just excessive, they are ridiculous. It should be obvious that the heir to the throne should avoid embarrassing the government of the day, especially abroad. His recent remarks, albeit in private, supposedly comparing Putin to Hitler during a visit to Canada, were a big mistake. It was not an endearing gaffe of the sort that the Duke of Edinburgh periodically commits, it was a liability to British diplomacy from a man who is coming ever closer to the throne that will one day be his. I suspect it is a lesson learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his home turf, though, why should the Prince not have a voice in public debate? It is his country, after all, as much as ours. Is there really such a clear line between his activities that are indisputably praiseworthy - the Prince's Trust, for instance, which, among other things, provides training for those who might otherwise not find employment - and speaking out about planning and complementary medicine?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the complaints most often made is that the Prince's power is insidious and unaccountable. By writing to ministers in private, it is said, he exercises influence below the radar. To which there are two responses. The first takes the form of a question: what is the evidence that any of these interventions has had any real effect? If Prince Charles was lobbying for more measures to combat climate&nbsp;change, for herbal remedies on the NHS or for a new age of grammar schools, he has signally failed. There is quite a big difference between trying to influence and succeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second response would be to say that if the Prince had a recognised role in public life, he would not have to write &quot;black spider&quot; letters to ministers in private, but could make his views known as a contribution to the public debate. He has done this over the years with architecture and planning - successfully, with his own project at Poundbury in Dorset and with his condemnation of the &quot;monstrous carbuncle&quot; that would, in his view, have disfigured London's Trafalgar Square. Personally, as far as the quality of planning and the capital's skyline goes, I would have welcomed a little more princely intervention over the years, rather than a little less.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOORDWIJK, the Netherlands -- Along a rugged, wide North Sea beach here on a recent day, children formed teams of eight to 10, taking their places beside mounds of sand carefully cordoned by candy-cane striped tape. They had one hour for their sand castle competition. Some built fishlike structures, complete with scales. Others spent their time on elaborate ditch and dike labyrinths. Each castle was adorned on top with a white flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then they watched the sea invade and devour their work, seeing whose castle could withstand the tide longest. The last standing flag won.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theirs was no ordinary day at the beach, but a newly minted, state-sanctioned competition for schoolchildren to raise awareness of the dangers of rising sea levels in a country of precarious geography that has provided lessons for the world about water management, but that fears that its next generation will grow complacent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-five percent of the Netherlands is either below sea level or heavily flood-prone. Yet thanks to its renowned expertise and large water management budget (about 1.25 percent of gross domestic product), the Netherlands has averted catastrophe since a flooding disaster in 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts here say that they now worry that the famed Dutch water management system actually works too well and that citizens will begin to take for granted the nation's success in staying dry. As global climate change threatens to raise sea levels by as much as four feet by the end of the century, the authorities here are working to make real to children the forecasts that may seem far-off, but that will shape their lives in adulthood and old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everything works so smoothly that people don't realize anymore that they are taking a risk in developing urban areas in low-lying areas,'' said Raimond Hafkenscheid, the lead organizer of the competition and a water expert with the Foreign Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the competition, the children, ages 6 to 11, were coached by experts in dike building and water management. Volunteers stood by, many of them freshly graduated civil engineers, giving last-minute advice on how best to battle the rising water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event, sponsored by two regional water authorities, also featured sophisticated Dutch technology, including an airborne drone that monitors hard-to-reach water management infrastructure, and a jeep-mounted infrared camera used to detect weaknesses in dikes, which showed thermal images of the most promising sand castles resisting the seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If children can do it themselves, they really learn it,'' said Harcko Pama, a teacher at an elementary school in Heemstede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I know that they will remember this when they are older -- it has such great impact,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pama's class of 11-year-olds competed in three separate teams to build the most flood-resistant castle. Armed with shovels and using hands and feet to tamp down the wet sand, the children improvised, some bringing seawater up to the castles in their shoes, others using towels to move the sand. Plots measuring about nine square yards were carefully lined along the shore. Organizers had timed the exercise so that the children (and the judges) could watch their work being destroyed by the incoming tide just after they had finished construction. Some 250 children competed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if part of the greater lesson, the children, from four different elementary schools in low-lying regions of the country, met on a stretch of beach less than 10 miles north of a major dike renovation project. The new dike protecting the seaside resort town of Katwijk will feature a reinforced concrete core and an underground parking garage. The project is to be finished early next year at a cost of nearly $70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recently released report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on water management in the Netherlands pointed to an ''awareness gap'' among Dutch citizens. The finding did much to get the sand castle contest off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the awareness of the average citizen is only part of the problem. Many experts involved in technical aspects of water management warn of the rising average age of water professionals. Not only do fewer Dutch people worry about the rising tides, fewer go into technical fields, said Jaap Feil, who runs the National Water Traineeship program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onne Rosingh, a managing director at InTech, one of the many subcontractors that monitor the country's vast dike systems, explained. ''People want a clean job, and as civil engineer you have to stand with your boots in the mud,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that exposure to water management professionals and a little competition would awaken what Mr. Hafkenscheid called the ''Dutch gene'' in the students was obviously not far from the mind of one volunteer, who told a group of 11-year-olds that there would be many jobs in water management in 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You see all these kids and their enthusiasm -- that is our hope for the future,'' said Gerard Doornbos, chairman of the Rijnland District Water Control Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Doornbos's title, ''dijkgraaf,'' or earl of the dike, attests to the 13th-century origin and proud tradition of the water boards. He said that the expertise and investment in water protection over the years is one of the reasons that the Netherlands, with its new future-oriented plans, is relatively prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you start anticipating, as we are doing, it will be much easier,'' he said of the rising seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the obvious enthusiasm that the building of the sand castles brought, the subsequent dramatic destruction by the ocean's foot-high waves was the high point of the day. Children ran through the water from one ruin to the next, cheering as the castles tumbled one by one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end it was Esther van Zuylen's class from Flambouw Elementary School in the town of Nigtevecht whose white flag resisted the flood the longest, and her class got a little glass trophy from the dijkgraaf as a prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Making huge castles at low tides, trying to defend the castles as the tide comes in -- that is who we are as Dutchmen,'' Mr. Hafkenscheid said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late '70s, the world's most notorious drug lord, Pablo Escobar, wanted to build a zoo on his vast ranch in Colombia. So he smuggled in some elephants, giraffes and other exotic animals. Then in 1981, he bought four hippos from the San Diego Zoo, a male and three females. Three decades later at Hacienda N&aacute;poles, well after most of Don Pablo's menagerie have been sold off, the hippos and their offspring are thriving, and the locals don't quite know what to do with them.  - Jeremy Zilar</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;It still sends a frisson down the spine of certain producers to give airtime to the former chancellor Lord Lawson so that he can chip away at the widespread scientific agreement over the causes and impact of climate&nbsp;change. The temperature is always a little higher with a heretic in the room. And yet this route towards excitement has its dangers. As the go-to guy in the thinktank of his own creation, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Lawson was called in February to the studios of the Today programme for debate with Sir Brian Hoskins, a climatologist from Imperial College London. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things did not go as they should, and the broadcast became the subject of a complaint from Chit Chong, a Green party activist. Reviewing the broadcast, the BBC's head of editorial complaints, Fraser Steel, took a dim view. &quot;Lord Lawson's views are not supported by the evidence from computer modelling and scientific research,&quot; Steel says, &quot;and I don't believe this was made sufficiently clear to the audience . . . Furthermore the implication was that Lord Lawson's views on climate&nbsp;change were on an equal footing with those of Sir Brian.&quot; And they aren't. Sceptics have their place in the debate, Steel says in his provisional finding, but &quot;it is important to ensure that such views are put into the appropriate context and given due (rather than equal) weight.&quot; Chong is only partially satisfied. He'd like a right of reply and perhaps a balancing programme. And others say &quot;due weight&quot; should mean not having Lawson on at all. Still, Rome wasn't built in a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;To Italy, where much has changed since the fall from grace of Silvio Berlusconi. But not everything. The otherwise sober World Cup coverage of the august Corriere della Sera newspaper includes an inexplicable, news-defying photo gallery of the 145 most promising lovelies spotted in the crowds. There is particular attention paid to the Iranian women pictured, described as &quot;hotties&quot;. Silvio may be gone but his spirit lives on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;With the verdicts in the hacking trial, there is much discussion about the press and how it might behave in future. According to Will Gompertz, the BBC's forthright arts editor, there is room for improvement. Gompertz reviewed the tabloids for a group of international students in the Oxford cloisters last week. One by one he held up front pages and wondered aloud whether the details of Jordan's love life, hats at Royal Ascot and boy soldiers in Iraq really constitute &quot;news at all&quot;. The sum total, he said, was &quot;gossip, conjecture, unpleasant tittle-tattle and dollops of nostalgia&quot;. Speaks as he finds, does Will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Did Gompertz find his way to this event, a production of the BBC Faith Forum? &quot;Mindfulness in an era of 24-hour news cycle - discourse, meditation and Q&amp;A.&quot; Or did he get distracted and forget?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;No shortage of power, or money, on show this week at Fortune's Most Powerful Women International Summit - even if Theresa May did cancel at the eleventh hour. Attendees wondered about the event's title. &quot;It's a bit cringey,&quot; said one. &quot;Can you imagine a summit for the World's Most Powerful Men?&quot; &quot;We don't have to,&quot; said another. It's called the G8.&quot; The networking was important, the equality-demanding symbols more so. Guests using the bathrooms encountered an image of a &quot;business woman&quot;: bowler hat on head, financial newspaper in hand . . . and trousers round her ankles, obeying the call of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Continuing discussion in Northern Ireland of the Queen's tete-a-tete with Martin McGuinness - and renewed reason not to subscribe to the Spectator. In a Speccie blog, Melanie McDonagh refers to the Queen's groundbreaking first visit to a prison - Belfast's Crumlin Road jail, which once housed her two tour guides on Tuesday, McGuinness and Peter Robinson. However, the Speccie refers to it as Coleraine Prison. Coleraine, of course, is nearly 70 miles north of Belfast and to our knowledge has no prison, and certainly not one that used to hold some of the most dangerous paramilitary inmates in the western world. Luckily the Queen's grip of history and geography held up fairly well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Good news, finally, for the climate-change-denial/sceptic community as a Texas-based physicist offers a $10,000 reward to anyone who can comprehensively disprove the mainstream consensus. Dr Christopher Keating says anyone can play, so long as they are over 18 and refute the accepted view of climate&nbsp;change using recognisably solid science. &quot;Deniers actively claim that science is on their side and there is no proof of man-made climate&nbsp;change,&quot; Keating told the website College Fix.&quot;You would think that if it was really as easy as the deniers claim that someone, somewhere would do it. I am certain my money is safe.&quot; He's confident. But then as we noted earlier, our sceptics, who are not quite deniers, also speak against the mainstream consensus with great authority. Could be like taking candy from a baby. Go on, Lord Lawson, fill your boots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers urged to consider hundreds of billions of pounds of investment needed to protect UK economic competitiveness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vital parts of UK infrastructure are being neglected, with potentially severe impacts on national competitiveness and quality of life, according to a new study by engineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy networks, transport, waste and water are all at risk, while flood defences are falling well behind where they need to be. This is happening while future risks to these essential national services are intensifying, as more extreme weather under climate&nbsp;change is likely to bring more floods, droughts, fiercer storms and other more unpredictable weather that are likely to bring more serious challenges to infrastructure than have been faced in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report by the Institution of Civil Engineers produced a UK-wide score-card grading key aspects of infrastructure according to whether it was fit for purpose, required attention or was at risk. The organisation has carried out such &quot;state of the nation&quot; reports annually since 2000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineers urged ministers to start tackling the problems, in order to safeguard the UK's economic competitiveness, which relies heavily on having reliable national infrastructure. Hundreds of billions of pounds are likely to be needed in investment in the next decade, much of it in energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local transport fared worst in the assessment, and was judged at risk of serious failure, and the government was advised to make clearing the backlog of essential road maintenance a clear spending priority. Flood management was also graded as well below par, &quot;requiring attention&quot;. Energy also gained a C minus grade in the judging, meaning it also required government attention, while waste services came out only slightly better, but also requiring government intervention. Perhaps surprisingly, given the widespread criticism of water companies in the past few years as droughts and floods have taken their toll, water was one of the two highest graded services, gaining a B, meaning it was fit for purpose for the present but could face challenges in future. Strategic transport comprising airports and major rail links and motorways - also came off relatively well, judged &quot;adequate for now&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter's floods, which left thousands fleeing their homes in January, were highlighted as an example of the costly and damaging interruptions that can strike householders and businesses alike. Many people and transport routes are still not back to normal. Although such natural disasters are always a risk, the resulting damage can be mitigated if essential services are well-prepared and precautions have been taken to make transport, communications, water and energy networks more resilient, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICE also warned of a domino effect whereby the failure of one aspect of infrastructure - such as flood defences - then has a damaging impact on energy, water, transport and waste networks. This has not been sufficiently taken into account in providing such services, the organisation warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the engineers also acknowledged that making all infrastructure fully proofed against all possible shocks was not feasible, and that trade-offs would have to be made between full reliability and the likelihood of damage. Drawing that line is always likely to be a matter of dispute, and one of the key issues will be how governments direct the private sector to build resilience into their systems. That could take many forms - for instance, providing more electricity substations than are necessary in an area in case some are overwhelmed by flooding. This requires a degree of coordination among the private sector owners of infrastructure that many experts would argue is not present today. ICE said it would require &quot;the right regulatory environment&quot; to be put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Clarke, vice president at ICE, laid the blame for a lack of planning squarely at the feet of ministers: &quot;The public expect a certain level of service. Government ultimately bears the risk for the resulting impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As climate&nbsp;change takes hold, such events are likely to become more frequent. But minsters were recently sharply criticised for failing to take those effects into account in planning for future flood defences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarke said: &quot;It is becoming clear that extreme weather events will become more frequent, and it is time that factors such as availability, resilience, and the domino effect are rooted into the criteria used to make decisions on which projects go ahead, so new infrastructure is more future-proofed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that &quot;management of the public's expectations of availability [of infrastructure] during adverse conditions&quot; would be crucial. This could mean ministers having to tell the public unpalatable truths about whether their essential services will be available - or whether their homes will be protected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New windfarms, strong winds and a good winter for hydropower plants sent renewable energy generation surging to 19.4% of all electricity from January to March</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One fifth of all electricity was generated in Britain by windfarms or other green technologies in the first three months of the year, according to new statistics released by the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;change (DECC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New windfarms coming online, strong winds and a good winter for hydropower plants sent renewable energy generation surging to 19.4% of all electricity from January to March 2014, up from about 12% for the same period last year. The power produced was enough for about 15m homes during the quarter. It was hailed as a breakthrough by the wind industry, which alone provided 12% of the overall power produced, and a rebuff to critics who have said that renewables would never account for such a large proportion of the energy mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the DECC data could stoke a new price row with energy suppliers because it shows gas prices to domestic customers rising in the first quarter with prices to businesses in decline at the same time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of gas to householders, including VAT, rose by 4.8% in real terms between the first quarter of 2013 and the same period of this year, while average gas prices to business customers, including the climate&nbsp;change levy, were 5.2% lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics underline the significant strides being taken by the industry to meet a government drive to reduce Britain's carbon emissions, although the scale of renewable energy subsidies remains controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the data also shows that in 2013 only 5.2% of final energy consumption, including heat and transport, came from renewable sources - well short of the a target of 15% by 2020 set by EU directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lobby group Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the UK was still lagging behind most other EU states and needed to do more, especially in the field of green heat and transport biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every percentage point increase in homegrown renewable energy makes us that much more energy secure. The progress in electricity is encouraging, but growth is not yet strong enough in renewable heat and transport to meet the government's objectives,&quot; said Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the REA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UK continued to be highly reliant on coal for its power, according to the government statistics released on Thursday. About 37% of the UK's electricity came from coal in the first three months of this year, down from a peak of 44% in the same period for 2012, but still a substantial amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the UK's own production of coal fell by 27% from January to March, owing mainly to controversial colliery closures, the amount of coal imported from Russia rose by 21%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture on gas proved a surprise against the backdrop of ministerial plans to focus on it. Less electricity was generated in the UK from gas in the early part of this year than at any time in at least 16 years, the figures from the DECC showed, throwing into doubt the coalition's vow for a new &quot;dash for gas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demand for gas fell by about 8%, and gas represented about 23% of electricity generation. Ministers from both the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have made clear their backing for a big expansion of the UK's gas-fired power generation in order to &quot;keep the lights on&quot;, as energy chiefs have warned of power shortages by the end of the decade because many of the UK's current ageing nuclear reactors and coal-fired power stations must be taken out of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DECC data reports the total amount of electricity generated by all forms of renewable power reached 18.1 terrawatt hours in the first three months of this year, up 43% on the same period last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the whole of 2013, the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, including solar, hydro and biomass, was up by 30% on 2012. Offshore wind rose the most - by 52% - but solar was also up by 51%, while hydro generation fell by 11%, reflecting lower rainfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DECC data reveals that the price of electricity for domestic customers was up by 5.9% in real terms quarter on quarter - the same figure as recorded for industrial electricity prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and move towards low-carbon alternatives was a key feature of the UN's recent climate&nbsp;change report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commonly cited statistic is that we need to invest $1tn by 2030 to finance the low-carbon technologies required to avoid the worst consequences of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But investment in renewable energy has been falling, not rising, for the past few years. Globally it dipped 12% to $254bn last year, a long way from a high of $318bn in 2011. Part of the decline has been attributed to the fall in the cost of solar, but other factors at play include policy uncertainty, which is leading to more cautious investment approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how can the huge pools of investment that are needed be unlocked? Join our panel of experts for a live chat on this topic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wednesday, 3 July, 1-2:30am BST (8-9:30am ET)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. We'll be taking your questions on a wide range of topics, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; How can we establish the business and social case for investment in renewables?&middot; What incentives are needed to increase funding for clean energy from banks, venture capitalists, private equity firms and retail investors?&middot; Could the rise of crowdfunding give renewables a needed boost? What progress has been made and what's holding it back?&middot; What lessons can we learn from around the world? A quarter of Germany's energy comes from renewables and half of that capacity is owned by individuals. And last year, China invested more in renewables than the whole of Europe combined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama acknowledged Wednesday that his efforts to combat climate&nbsp;change -- in particular, Environmental Protection Agency regulations to slash carbon pollution from cars and coal-fired power plants -- could raise fuel and electricity prices. And he told environmental advocates that in order to make a credible case for such climate policies, officials would need to acknowledge Americans' worries about the economic effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People don't like gas prices going up; they are concerned about electricity prices going up,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech at an annual dinner for the League of Conservation Voters. ''If we're blithe about saying, 'This is the crisis of our time,' but we don't acknowledge these legitimate concerns -- we've got to shape our strategies to address the very real and legitimate concerns of working families.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change remains among the few policy items he can push through without action from Congress, and the issue is likely to define the remainder of his time in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also said Wednesday that he recognized that even as he pushed the United States to cut its carbon pollution, emissions were soaring in developing economies, particularly in India and China, as those nations seek to lift millions of people out of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The trade-offs for them are tougher than for us unless we describe how development should leapfrog the old sources of energy,'' the president said. He emphasized that the United States should take the lead in developing low-carbon sources of energy that would give poorer economies better access to electricity without increasing their carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the State Department, diplomats are working toward a global carbon-cutting deal to be signed in 2015, and Mr. Obama said nations would be lured to the negotiating table if the United States managed to cut carbon pollution without hurting the domestic economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When America proves what's possible, other countries are going to come along,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama again mocked officials who question or deny the established science that human activity, particularly the burning of coal and oil, cause climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In communities, they may not know how big a problem climate&nbsp;change is, but they generally don't say, 'I don't believe anything scientists say' -- except in Congress,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have increased attacks on Republicans who deny human involvement in climate&nbsp;change, seeing it as a winning political strategy. Polls by the League of Conservation Voters and other groups show that younger voters in particular associate candidates who deny climate science with being out of touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just three weeks ago, Mr. Obama announced a landmark Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at slashing planet-warming carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. But the rule faces substantial legal, political and legislative attacks, and Republicans have criticized it as a ''war on coal'' that will drive up energy prices and eliminate jobs in the coal industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration has begun an aggressive public relations effort to help sell the new proposal to the public, and environmental groups are gearing up to back politicians who embrace the rule. A major part of that campaign will be to convince Americans that climate&nbsp;change poses as much of a threat to the nation's economy as it does to the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That effort was aided this week by the release of a report laying out the economic threats posed by human-caused climate&nbsp;change. The report, written by a team of economists and analysts, was financed by a bipartisan team of financiers -- the billionaire Tom Steyer, who is campaigning to elect politicians who push climate policy; former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the report highlighted soaring costs for the insurance industry and taxpayers as more extreme storms batter the coasts, and the expenses that farmers and consumers will face as increased drought devastates farmland and reduces crop yields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama's top advisers and cabinet members, including his counselor, John Podesta; Treasury Secretary Jack Lew; Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett met with the backers and authors of the report and with top officials from the insurance industry to discuss the economic consequences of increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''The Coming Climate Crash'' (Sunday Review, June 22):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hopes that former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s leadership on climate&nbsp;change will give other Republicans what they need to support climate action; his analogy to the financial crisis speaks their language. But there is a better analogy that also speaks their language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change poses risks to our national interests that are long term, uncertain and very large. Republicans and others happily spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on defense budgets to mitigate the same types of risks. In fact, the defense establishment is already a strong supporter of climate action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These lines of reasoning should make it O.K. for Republicans to do the right thing for the climate. And perhaps their congressional leaders will follow them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILHELM M. MERCK Hamilton, Mass., June 23, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s logic on a carbon tax matches the tax itself -- straightforward, simple and effective. His comparison of the 2008 financial crisis to the climate crisis can be carried a step further if one compares cap-and-trade with a carbon tax as the way to reduce carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street's derivatives fueled the 2008 crisis. Cap-and-trade would create an enormous new market for Wall Street. A carbon tax would not: one more reason to favor a carbon tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANET E. MILNE South Royalton, Vt., June 22, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a professor of law and director of the Environmental Tax Policy Institute at Vermont Law School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ''The Big Green Test'' (column, June 23), Paul Krugman too hastily dismissed as politically infeasible the carbon tax ably advanced by Henry M. Paulson Jr. Mr. Krugman is right that Republicans would block a tax increase. But when the G.O.P. finally begins to see reason on climate&nbsp;change, it may appreciate a revenue-neutral carbon tax that includes offsetting cuts in payroll or corporate taxes, or pro rata ''dividends'' to households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Krugman correctly refers to complementary measures like clean-energy subsidies as ''second best,'' he may not appreciate the extent to which their carbon-reducing potential is dwarfed by a carbon tax. Our modeling has established that a carbon tax would eliminate nearly three times as much carbon pollution as price-equivalent, optimally designed subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress may not yet be ready to show leadership in passing a federal carbon tax. But there are serious efforts underway in several states to enact carbon taxes patterned after the carbon tax that has been reducing emissions in British Columbia since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road to an American carbon tax could be long, but the prize -- steep reductions delivered efficiently and affordably, through a policy that can be duplicated globally -- is extraordinary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ice at the poles is the air-conditioner of our planet. It is like the ice that keeps our gin and tonic cold even in the burning sun: When the ice is gone, the temperature jumps. We must act before that!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the old Marshall Plan not only rebuilt war-devastated cities in Europe, but also created jobs and prosperity, so should our next Marshall Plan, which will take us from our disastrous hydrocarbon burning age into the age of clean, inexhaustible and free energy. All it takes is to invest in developing this new technology instead of in the coming energy wars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with Pascal Husting is that he looks more like a person who flies to work than he does an employee of Greenpeace. In fact, he's both - Greenpeace's international programme director was exposed this week as a plane commuter - and that's what has fired another torpedo into the scull of the environmental movement. What, exactly, is the point of a campaign whose top brass cannot bring themselves to eschew the very behaviour they're campaigning against?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet if there is one thing more depressing than a world-class environmentalist flying from Luxembourg to Amsterdam as a commute, it's how easy it is to set greens, deep greens and green-leaners against one another. The best way to never be a hypocrite, and to always stay consistent, is to deny climate&nbsp;change, and have no agenda on anything beyond self-interest. There's always a chance you'll fall foul of sexual morality, which is the only kind you will still admit into debate, but in every other realm, ethics need not trouble you. Indeed, the more ardently you pursue your own interests, the more persuasively you live your own values. If, on the other hand, you have ambitions for large-scale change and believe things could be significantly better for vast numbers of people, you will always fail fully to embody your own hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It won't necessarily be by flying. You might buy your kid some trainers in Primark, or buy yourself clothes you don't need; you might eat meat. You might sometimes drive when you could take public transport, or take public transport when you could cycle. It will always be possible for someone not just to critique your choices, but also to critique them on the same terms, using the same measures, as you critique the choices made by society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be entirely untainted by the flaws of civilisation, you would have to live outside it: off-grid, deep green, breathing some other air. This, however, would diminish your impact, because you would de facto be excluded from public life. The territory is knee-deep in the squelch of compromise, and nobody likes to dwell on this more than the people to whom the fact of climate&nbsp;change is in itself distasteful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have sat in meetings while people from rightwing newspapers laugh at a Green politician getting a taxi home from a midnight TV interview - as if, for the audacity of believing things could be better, her whole life should be lived in penance. The assumption underneath is that self-interest is the baseline; anything more ambitious has to be paid for in sweat and tears. It would be good if we could rewrite that, so that hoping for better was a collective, not a personal, adventure, and self-interest was the thing that had to be constantly justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flying is in its own peculiar league, of course. If roughly a quarter of a person's carbon footprint is transport, then this is the easiest, most discretionary splurge, which is why greens have been campaigning against it for years. It's also extremely visible. When Rio+20 - the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development - took place two years ago, Ed Gillespie, author of Only Planet: A Flight-Free Adventure Around the World, said: &quot;I remember talking to a journalist from the BBC about it, and asking what her line was going to be. She said, 'How ironic that environmentalists from across the world have all taken a plane to get here.' I just thought, is that the best you can do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace's problems run wider and deeper than one person's travel arrangements - Husting has now said he will take the train rather than the plane. The organisation recently lost &pound;3m on currency speculation, which will be extremely difficult to explain to its mainly small-amount donors. Greenpeace has made a stab at an explanation already, which is that, since its donations mainly come in euros but were spent in other currencies, this left it &quot;highly exposed&quot; to fluctuations in the currency markets; exchange contracts protected them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unfortunate the protection came at such a high risk and with a price of its own. Greenpeace was behaving like a corporation which campaigns, and makes business decisions to protect its wherewithal for campaigning, rather than a charity with values. The former asks myopic questions about where to keep its euros safe; the latter would ask panoramic questions about the financial deals it did and whether there was a deeper message in the volatility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities are notorious for this, and have been for years: investing in businesses that work expressly against their beliefs; sinking their reserves into stock portfolios of arms and tobacco companies. It's as easy a target as a flying environmentalist, but a more proper one. When charities drop their standards and lose their capacity for self-examination, they traduce the values of the people who donate money to them. It's bigger than the misuse of funds; it's a mockery of the ideas that raised them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared with this, the sin of flying looks rather small. After all, it would be better if nobody flew. Environmentalists have never been perfect enough to silence their opponents - such perfection probably doesn't exist. The aim is to work towards better systems, not exist in this system as superior people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greens have a new tone, distilled in Gillespie's book. &quot;I'm not asking you to give anything up; I'm asking you to rediscover something wonderful. You won't miss that airport if you dare to step out of it. You can get anywhere in Europe within 24 hours on a train; it puts the romance and adventure back into travel. There's certainly no romance in Stansted.&quot; Or indeed Schipol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: Clive Palmer's emissions trading announcement effectively leaves Abbott completely isolated on climate policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive Palmer's shock announcement&nbsp;on Wednesday night&nbsp;next to former vice president Al Gore has been very cautiously welcomed by Australia's environment&nbsp;movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palmer's announcement effectively leaves Abbott completely isolated on climate policy, both domestically, and as Al Gore's presence demonstrates, internationally as well. It is remarkable that&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Australia's largest coal barons has firmly declared his support for renewables, taking action on global warming, and introducing an emissions trading scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior leaders of some of the largest environment groups told me that they welcome Palmer's position on the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate&nbsp;Change Authority, while approaching the details with caution and a large grain of salt. It was labelled as &quot;definitely surprising&quot;, &quot;very smart politically&quot;, &quot;surprising&quot; and &quot;courageous&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no details behind Palmer's announcement, and it is unclear what approach he will take with his decision to support the abolition of the carbon &quot;tax&quot; and its replacement with an emissions trading scheme. Palmer also stated&nbsp;that he would not support prime minister Abbott's &quot;direct action&quot; policy, criticising it as a waste of money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly O'Shanassy, the new CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is organising the Climate Reality project that Gore is in Australia for, said &quot;keeping the 'clean three' of the RET, the CEFC, and the CCA is great news for all Australians. It's great to see that Clive Palmer has the courage to listen to the voices of Australians when they say they support clean energy and they support cutting pollution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several recent polls showed that a large majority of 72 percent of Australians support keeping or expanding the renewable energy target. Similarly, the&nbsp;polls show that Australians support putting a price on carbon, and just 22 percent support the discredited &quot;direct action&quot; policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clean Energy Council was effusive in its congratulations.&nbsp;Deputy Chief Executive Kane Thornton described the announcement as &quot;a Titanic boost for the clean energy industry&quot;. Increasing the proportion of Australia's energy from renewable sources would mean lower costs for consumers and potentially thousands of extra jobs.&nbsp;Kane&nbsp;said in a statement, &quot;what we need is policy&nbsp;stability to&nbsp;unlock these benefits, and the best outcome for the industry is if the policy is left alone to continue working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior environment campaigner noted to me that &quot;we are approaching Palmer's announcement with caution, especially on the RET. This is not the first time the Palmer United Party has made an announcement about renewables, only to see it reversed less than 24 hours later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is clear is that Tony Abbott's offensive against&nbsp;renewable energy and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are effectively dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO of Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham said to me, &quot;Palmer's announcement is definitely surprising, but is a pretty productive intervention that will change climate politics in Australia. The government should now give up on its attack on the RET and the CEFC immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Pearson, the head of campaigning&nbsp;for Greenpeace Australia-Pacific agreed, saying to me: &quot;if this position holds, Palmer has turned climate politics on its axis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most ambiguous part of Palmer's announcement related to his position on the carbon price. He has said he wants to abolish the carbon tax and replace it with an emissions trading scheme. The catch is that he doesn't want the ETS to kick in until our major trading partners have one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spoke to someone intimately involved in creating the architecture of the carbon price under Labor and asked them whether what Palmer was proposing was even possible. If Palmer votes to keep the architecture of the carbon price, by&nbsp;simply amending the existing legislation to set the price to zero dollars, and delays the automatic linkage of the carbon price to Europe's scheme, then it would be relatively simple to re-start Australia's emissions trading scheme in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACF's O'Shanassy said, &quot;what the Palmer United Party has proposed around the carbon price is basically like taking the battery out of your car. The car still runs fine, and a smart person can always come along, replace the battery, and be off to the races.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I'm told&nbsp;it would become a &quot;nightmare&quot; if the entire carbon pricing framework was torn up and rewritten from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National campaign director for the Wilderness Society, Lyndon Schneiders, told me that &quot;it's fantastic that Palmer is supporting an ETS and retaining the renewable energy target. It would be great to now see him to renounce his Galilee coal projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO of The Climate Institute, John Connor, however, described the potential repeal of the carbon price as &quot;ugly&quot; and said it was unclear &quot;whether the Palmer United Party's call for an emissions trading scheme is a pre-condition for repeal of the carbon price and exactly what is intended.&nbsp;The devil is in the detail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This concern was held by several other eNGO leaders, who told me that they fear Palmer is more interested in&nbsp;creating a political bargaining chip, rather than having any real commitment to climate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cautious welcome to Palmer's announcement extended beyond the environment movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also spoke to several union leaders, and the opposition Labor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Long, the Victorian secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union, a union that has been a strong advocate for climate action, told me that &quot;Palmer's acknowledgement of the importance of dealing with climate&nbsp;change is significant, and the idea of an ETS is an improvement on Abbott's useless &quot;direct action&quot; corporate subsidy policy. Palmer's commitment to the renewable energy target and the CEFC is a great relief and will hopefully thwart the Coalition's attempt to destroy the renewable energy industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-standing carbon price supporter and national president of the union representing coal miners, Tony Maher of the CFMEU, told me,&nbsp;&quot;our concern about abolishing the ETS was that it would mean we had to renegotiate all the consumer and job protections all over again in the future. It's not clear whether PUP is proposing to leave all those protections in place or not. We will be urging them to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Labor also welcomed Palmer's support for an emissions trading scheme. An opposition spokesman said, &quot;Labor's position on climate&nbsp;change has not changed. We will not support the repeal of the carbon tax unless there is a credible alternative that will deliver meaningful action to tackle climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that Palmer (and Gore) has completely rewritten climate politics in Australia. Why he has done this is not clear, and there are elements of incomprehensibility in what has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as a political tactic, it could potentially be a master stroke, and consigns Abbott's almost non-existent climate policy to the dust bin. As Greenpeace's Pearson quipped, &quot;tonight Al Gore has delivered Tony Abbott an inconvenient senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is not an event in your children's future. It is bearing down upon you now. And there is nothing you -- or anyone else -- can do to prevent the hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next quarter-century, heat-related death rates will probably double in the southeastern states. Crop losses that used to happen only once every 20 years because of cataclysmic weather will occur five times as often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is our future even if every person on the planet abruptly stopped burning coal, gas, oil, wood or anything else containing carbon today and we hooked the world economy onto the wind and the sun tomorrow. The change is baked in, caused by CO2 spewed into the air long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This stark future is rendered vividly in a comprehensive report released on Tuesday by the Risky Business Project, a coalition of political and business luminaries representing widely different political views -- including the former Treasury secretaries George P. Shultz, Robert E. Rubin and Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- that is intended to raise awareness about the impending perils of a changing climate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is aimed squarely at corporate America, offering the kind of risk modeling a financial firm might make to assess the probable impact of a changing climate on an investment portfolio whose ''assets'' included farming, housing, labor productivity and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together with the latest assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, reported in April, last month's National Climate Assessment and the new rules proposed by the Obama administration to combat carbon pollution from power plants, it contributes to a new picture of climate&nbsp;change. And it is not pretty, puncturing the hopes held by some of the most uncompromising environmentalists and the most compromising politicians that humanity can still prevent climactic upheaval if we only start replacing fossil fuels today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, it seems clear by now that the world's temperature will almost certainly rise more than two degrees Celsius -- or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit -- above the average of the late 19th century, a ceiling that the world's leaders have repeatedly promised never to breach and a point at which climate-related risks rise even more sharply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One prominent energy economist told me, speaking anonymously to avoid looking too gloomy, that the world would be ''extraordinarily unlikely'' to stay below the two-degree ceiling. Every country would need to decarbonize at the same pace that France did during its nuclear renaissance in the 1980s and keep up the pace for decades. Then we would have to start taking CO2 out of the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, despite the rising awareness of the risks caused by our unrestrained consumption of fossil fuels, there is no evidence that we plan to break the habit and leave a substantial portion of the Earth's oil, gas and coal in the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are swinging to fossil fuels in ways that couldn't have been imagined a few years ago,'' said Michael Greenstone of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''We've made substantial progress in renewables, but there's been even more innovation in fossil fuels. Incentives to invest in low-carbon energy are going down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Risky Business report lays out in detail, climate&nbsp;change over the next few decades is already a done deal. Whether we continue emitting CO2 at the current pace or somehow manage to buckle our belts and shift our economies onto something else, temperatures will increase by about the same amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The economic benefits of mitigation do not start to be felt until midcentury and are most obvious in the second half of the century,'' notes the report. Under the most pessimistic forecast -- in which we do nothing to burn fewer fossil fuels -- the average global temperature rises up to 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the next five to 25 years. Under the most optimistic, it rises about 1.6 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing carbon emissions now is about helping prevent even more serious damage 50, 75 and 100 years from today. To address the more immediate risks, notes Trevor Houser, who heads the energy practice at the Rhodium Group, the economic modeling firm that performed the risk analysis for the Risky Business report, the best we can do is ''invest in adaptation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do with this awareness? Homeowners in New York's Red Hook and Coney Island neighborhoods should probably consider waterproofing, as both will fall into the one-in-100-year flood area over the next 25 years. Hospitals in the Southeast might want to staff up. The federal government may want to consider what will happen to the budget when it is left to reconstruct every city that gets pounded by a hurricane, not to mention the higher costs of heavily subsidized crop and flood insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is more to be gained. A more realistic, detailed and nuanced assessment of both the damages that await us might allow for a more effective response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two degrees or bust not only commits the world to a probably unattainable goal, it promotes despondency once it becomes obvious we won't meet it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the Risky Business analysis, which dispassionately lays out damages to specific places and economic sectors along a probability curve as the temperature rises well past two degrees, allows for the kind of cost-benefit assessment that could mobilize effective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2100, up to $507 billion worth of coastal property will be underwater if we continue emitting CO2 at the same pace as we have over recent decades. New York will face a one-in-100 chance of seeing the sea rise almost seven feet. Crop yields in the Southwest, Midwest and the lower Great Plains could fall up to 70 percent as extreme heat spreads throughout the middle of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the final decades of the century, Nebraska will face a one-in-20 chance that climate&nbsp;change will reduce its agricultural production by almost $2,000 for each man, woman and child in the state. North Dakota will face a one-in-20 chance that declining productivity will cost the state $1,600 per person, as workers stay indoors out of the sun. Arizona will face one-in-20 odds that energy costs will rise by $800 per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These odds are easier to understand than the panel on climate&nbsp;change's abstract, abstruse estimate that keeping the temperature from increasing more than two degrees Celsius above the preindustrial era will cost up to 11 percent of consumption by 2100, in a world economy that would be three to nine times as large as today's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question, for corporate chieftains, business leaders and voters remains: What is it worth to prevent these costs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps our new understanding -- detailed and specific -- of their magnitude and timing will compel us to act. Mr. Paulson laid out an action plan in The New York Times on Sunday, centered on a tax on carbon emissions. Professor Greenstone supports a tax coupled with a major expansion of investment in research to develop cost-competitive technologies, which the United States could also make available to the big polluters of the future: China and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't hold your breath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hot weather kills more Americans than all other natural disasters combined, and the casualties continue to climb despite decades of warnings about how to recognize the signs of heat stress and take prompt corrective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With climate&nbsp;change, some experts predict ever-worsening summer heat waves and even more related illnesses and deaths. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that excessive heat caused by climate&nbsp;change could kill more than 150,000 Americans by the end of the century in the 40 largest cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As carbon pollution continues to rise, the number of dangerously hot days each summer will increase even further, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of lives lost,'' the council reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme heat claims an average of 117 lives each year, but the real incidence is likely far higher. In addition, about 1,800 people die from illnesses made worse by heat, the council estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Death rates from many causes rise during heat waves that are related to heat but not reported as such,'' said Dr. Christopher B. Colwell, director of emergency medicine at Denver Health Medical Center. ''Lots of deaths that occur during heat waves are attributed to natural causes like heart attacks, kidney disease or respiratory disease.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially at risk are the elderly, young children, athletes of all ages and weekend warriors whose bodies are not adapted to heat stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As common as the problem is, it's not common enough to grab people's attention until it hits close to home,'' Dr. Colwell said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a high-profile death, like that of Korey Stringer, 27, a Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle who suffered heatstroke after a summer morning practice in 2001, has not prompted all coaches to take necessary precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Many coaches have held practices in the heat for years and no one died, so they think a bigger deal is being made of the problem than it really is,'' Dr. Colwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six years before Stringer's death, 19 high school and college players died from heatstroke, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. Too often, a player suffering from heat exhaustion, the first stage of a potentially life-threatening heat illness, is sent back on the field after a brief rest instead of being benched for the day or longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While deaths of healthy young athletes tend to be well publicized, the elderly are much more likely to succumb to extreme heat. Dr. Colwell explained that with age, the body's ability to cool itself declines. Among other changes, blood vessels don't dilate as readily to allow heat to escape, a problem made worse by conditions like congestive heart failure and peripheral vascular disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many older people without air-conditioning or fans may not know when to get out of the heat, or they may be physically unable to leave an overheated dwelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dehydration, a common problem among the elderly as well as among younger people who exercise strenuously, raises the risk of heat illness by diminishing the body's ability to lose heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medications taken by many older people also increase their vulnerability to heat stress, among them beta blockers prescribed for high blood pressure and anticholinergics used to treat lung problems and urinary incontinence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other drugs, too, can contribute to a hypersensitivity to heat, including lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines and antispasmodics. Recreational drugs, like cocaine, amphetamines, PCP and alcohol, can be a problem as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat illness often occurs several days into a heat wave, as the effects on the body accumulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body normally operates within a rather narrow temperature range. If body temperature rises above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, enzymes begin to break down and normal metabolic processes are disrupted. When Stringer collapsed, his temperature registered above 108 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat radiates from the body when blood vessels are maximally dilated and the air temperature is lower than body temperature. But the most effective natural coolant is sweat; as it collects on the skin and evaporates, it draws heat from the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of heat illness rises with the heat index, a combined measure of air temperature and relative humidity. When the humidity is high (or too much clothing is worn), sweat simply rolls off the skin without evaporating and cooling it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coaches, take note: depending on athletes' ages, intensity of activity and degree of acclimatization, you should consider canceling practice and games when the heat index exceeds 105, experts say. City dwellers are most at risk during heat waves because paved surfaces, tall buildings and minimal tree cover enhance heat absorption, creating a ''heat island.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat illness is a form of hyperthermia, defined as a rise in core body temperature. But it does not respond to fever-reducing medications, making it extremely important to recognize heat exhaustion, an early sign of trouble. Common complaints include fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea and muscle cramps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Colwell explained that the brain's cerebellum is especially sensitive to heat, which explains the early signs of a heatstroke: unsteady gait, confusion and disorientation. Heatstroke, characterized by a rise in body temperature above 104 degrees, has a death rate as high as 50 percent. Symptoms typically include a change in mental status, like delirium, seizures or even coma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the elderly, heatstroke most often develops gradually, over several hot days. But among otherwise healthy people engaged in strenuous exercise, it tends to occur suddenly, within minutes to hours, which demands particular attention to early symptoms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BORTH, WALES -- There is a poem children in Wales learn about the sunken kingdom of Cantre'r Gwaelod, swallowed by the sea and drowned forever after. On a quiet night, legend has it, one can hear the kingdom's church bells ringing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the sea swallowed part of Britain's western coastline this year and then spat it out again, leaving homes and livelihoods destroyed but also a dense forest of prehistoric tree stumps more exposed than ever, it was as if one had caught a faint glimpse of that Welsh Atlantis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The submerged forest of Borth is not new. First flooded some 5,000 years ago by rising sea levels after the last ice age, it has been there as long as locals remember, coming and going with the tides and occasionally disappearing under the sand for years on end. But the floods and storms that battered Britain earlier this year radically changed the way archaeologists interpret the landscape: A quarter-mile-long saltwater channel cutting through the trees, revealed by erosion for the first time, provided a trove of clues to where human life may have been concentrated and where its traces may yet be found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We used to think of this as just as an impenetrable forest -- actually this was a complex human environment,'' said Martin Bates, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Wales Trinity St. David, who oversees the excavation work in Borth on a beach he played on as a toddler. ''The floods have opened our eyes as to what's really out there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scanning the army of ghostly spikes protruding from the sand here one recent morning, Dr. Bates said it was as if nature were making a point: The recent torrential rains, linked by a growing number of climatologists to human-induced climate&nbsp;change, have provided an ancient laboratory to study how humans coped with catastrophic climate&nbsp;change in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, across Britain, two consecutive years of exceptional winter weather have left in their wake some equally exceptional discoveries: from unexploded wartime bombs and Victorian shipwrecks to archaeological finds that are nearly a million years old. Scientists have barely kept up. Last winter was the wettest on record, according to the Met Office, the national weather service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dog walkers and amateur archaeologists are being sought in ever-greater numbers to help record new sites. In some areas hit especially hard by erosion, locals are equipped with cameras that log digital images with geocoordinates so the artifacts they find on beach walks can be added to national databases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Archaeologists can't be everywhere, but locals can,'' said Erin Kavanagh, Dr. Bates's partner and a fellow archaeologist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicholas Ashton, the curator of Paleolithic and Mesolithic collections at the British Museum, has been organizing ''fossil road shows'' in which he invites civilians to bring in any potential archaeological finds and have them identified. (One man recently showed up with a six-inch-long hippo tusk and a well-preserved ax, both found locally and both more than half a million years old.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having those extra eyes on the ground can make all the difference in coastal areas, Dr. Ashton said, for what the sea reveals, it tends to reclaim almost as soon. He learned this lesson firsthand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2013, shortly after the first set of storms, Dr. Ashton commissioned Dr. Bates, an old university friend, to work on Britain's east coast in Norfolk. The beach near Happisburgh (pronounced hays-boro), a longstanding archaeological site, had suffered severe erosion. Dr. Ashton, an expert in early humans, wanted a geophysical survey to map any channels or rivers that might lie beneath about 30 feet of sediment. Some of these channels, he reckoned, might contain evidence of early humans because sources of freshwater would have been natural gathering spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was on their second visit, on May 10, that Dr. Bates noticed some indentions on the otherwise flat horizons of the laminated silts recently laid bare on the beach. The humps and bumps looked familiar. He told Dr. Ashton: ''They're just like the human footprints in Borth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footprints of humans and animals in Borth had been dated to about 6,000 years ago. The site in Happisburgh was 900,000 years old, a time when mammoths and hippos still roamed in these parts. No human bones or prints that old had ever been found in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could this be possible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A frantic race against time began. Every day, the shape of the prints would blur a little more as the coming tide eroded the contours of heels, toes and arches. A team led by Sarah Duffy from the University of York arrived to apply a technique called multi-image photogrammetry, taking about 150 digital photographs of the surface area containing the prints and feeding it into a program that created a three-dimensional model. By the time another team had come to do some laser scanning, it was too late: The prints were barely visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panicked, scientists lifted from the site a 130-pound block of sediment with one faint print on top, to have it analyzed at the National Oceanography Center. It is the only remaining physical evidence of the footprints: Before the month was out, all traces of them had vanished. It was a powerful reminder of both the resilience and the fragility of human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What had been preserved for nearly one million years was taken back by the sea in the space of 10 days,'' Dr. Ashton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially skeptical, he said he knew the footprints were real when Dr. Duffy's computer images landed in his inbox sometime last June. ''I thought, bloody hell, we are dealing with something quite extraordinary here,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footprints, the oldest known outside Africa, probably belonged to a family group of Homo antecessor, a cousin of Homo erectus that possibly became extinct when Homo heidelbergensis from Africa settled in Britain about 500,000 years ago, he said. Using foot-length-to-stature ratios, scientists estimate that the male was perhaps 5 feet 9 inches tall, and the smallest child a little less than 37 inches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little is known about this early human species. Fossil skeletons in Atapuerca, Spain, from around the same time suggest that they walked upright and looked much like modern humans, though their brains were smaller. If they had language, it was primitive. Living at the tail end of an interglacial era, as winters were growing colder, they may have had functional body hair. So far, there is no evidence that they used clothes, shelter, fire or tools more complex than simple stone flakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite their elusiveness, the human ancestors in whose footsteps modern-day Britons walk -- literally -- have fascinated the nation. Before some basic tools were found here in 2010, it had been believed that humans had entered Britain much later, about 700,000 years ago, Dr. Ashton said. (Before 2005, when another set of tools was discovered in Suffolk, the presumed date was 500,000 years ago.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''British civilization started in Norfolk,'' a headline in The Times of London put it at the time. A blog post by Dr. Ashton on the British Museum website on Feb. 7, when the paper he co-wrote about the footprints appeared, had more hits than any other post on the museum's site before or since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We can reconstruct the climate and climate&nbsp;change nearly one million years ago,'' Dr. Ashton said. ''The big lesson is, we have to adapt. Whether we like it or not, the climate will change -- it always has -- and today we are accelerating that change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing on the ridge above Cardigan Bay in Borth, Dr. Bates described what the area would have looked like at the height of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago: more than half a mile of ice overhead and dry land stretching across today's North Sea. The sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You could have walked from Denmark to Yorkshire in those days,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10,000 years ago, temperatures warmed sharply, by eight to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. By that time, the European ice sheets had melted, but the much thicker North American sheets took much longer. While the climate had warmed to today's levels, allowing mixed oak woodland to grow and humans to recolonize Britain, the sea level remained some 130 feet lower for another 3,000 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it did rise, it would have been traumatic for the population, wiping out whatever settlement there was, and eventually the forest of Borth. The displaced humans of the time, Dr. Bates said, were prehistoric refugees from climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Even in the reduced life span of the day, the coastline would have advanced dramatically,'' said Dr. Bates, who is convinced that stories like Cantre'r Gwaelod originated in this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar tales abound on the western European seaboard: There are Cornish and Breton versions, and variations of the theme exist in Jersey and the Orkney Islands. The ultimate legend, of course, is Atlantis, which Plato placed somewhere in the North Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a traumatic geological event, and people turned it into a story to make sense of it,'' said Gerald Morgan, a retired head teacher and local historian in nearby Aberystwyth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same thing is happening again today, as Britons survey the damage of the past couple of years of flooding and storms and ponder the future. The submerged forest in Borth, little known outside a small radius here, has once again become part of local lore. Its haunting shapes are featured in poetry slams and in storytelling evenings, and modern-day performances of Cantre'r Gwaelod have been staged on the beach, said Mr. Morgan and his wife, Enid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have they ever heard the bells?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Morgan smiled. ''I knew someone who did.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In a big win for environmentalists, the Supreme Court on Monday effectively endorsed the Obama administration's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from sources like power plants, even as it criticized what it called the administration's overreaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision is one in a recent string of rulings upholding the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to issue Clean Air Act regulations to curb climate&nbsp;change, and the agency celebrated the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the combative tone of Monday's ruling, along with its rejection of one of the agency's principal rationales for the regulations under review, suggests that the road ahead may be rocky for other initiatives meant to reduce carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision, said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard, ''gave the agency a tongue-lashing and suggested the potential for some significant limitations on how the agency chooses to exercise its authority in the future.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a part of the ruling decided by a 7-to-2 vote, the court said the E.P.A. could regulate sources of greenhouse gases as long as they would already need permits for emitting conventional pollutants. That approach allowed the agency to regulate large, industrial polluters, such as power plants and oil refineries, and exempted millions of the nation's small-scale carbon emitters, such as schools, apartment buildings and individual businesses like Dunkin' Donuts or Chipotle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In carving out the small emitters, the court effectively agreed with the agency, which saw such broad regulations as an unwieldy nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''E.P.A. is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said in summarizing the decision. ''It sought to regulate sources it said were responsible for 86 percent of all the greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources nationwide. Under our holdings, E.P.A. will be able to regulate sources responsible for 83 percent of those emissions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(''Stationary sources'' are buildings like factories and power plants; the agency also regulates tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined that part of the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency expressed satisfaction with the ruling. ''The Supreme Court's decision is a win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution because it allows E.P.A., states and other permitting authorities to continue to require carbon pollution limits in permits for the largest pollution sources,'' the agency said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another part of Monday's decision rejected the agency's primary rationale for the regulations. The agency had contended that it would interpret the Clean Air Act to require the regulation of far fewer stationary sources of pollution than the law seemed to require.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''An agency has no power to 'tailor' legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms,'' Justice Scalia wrote. Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined that part of the decision, which was decided by a 5-to-4 vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution was not to require broader regulation, Justice Scalia said. Rather, he said, the practical problems identified by the agency were reason to think it was misreading the statute. ''It would be patently unreasonable -- not to say outrageous -- for E.P.A. to insist on seizing expansive power that it admits the statute is not designed to grant,'' Justice Scalia wrote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Federation of Independent Business, a plaintiff in the case, welcomed what it said was the Supreme Court's refusal to allow the agency to rewrite the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If this rule had been allowed to stand, small-business owners such as ranchers, farmers, manufacturers, restaurant owners and others would have seen more paperwork, more oversight and fines,'' the group said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of President Obama's climate&nbsp;change agenda said the ruling did not affect the administration's recently proposed regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The E.P.A. has just proposed standards to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, and that critical work will move ahead to protect Americans from the worst impacts of climate&nbsp;change,'' said David Doniger, director of the clean air and climate&nbsp;change program with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts said that Monday's decision also included a warning that the court's view of the E.P.A.'s regulatory authority has its limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are not willing to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as E.P.A. embarks on this multiyear voyage of discovery,'' Justice Scalia wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statement was ''a warning shot,'' said Jody Freeman, a law professor at Harvard. ''It suggests that the courts will look skeptically at assertions of authority that are very new and very far-reaching.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the agency has been on a winning streak. In April, the Supreme Court upheld its authority to regulate smog from coal plants that drifts across state lines, a ruling that Professor Lazarus called ''one of E.P.A.'s biggest wins ever in the court.'' After Monday's ruling, he said, ''E.P.A. walked away standing, but not quite as tall as before.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations challenged in Monday's decision built on the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision in 2007 in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which required the agency to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles if it found that they endangered public health or welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency made such a finding, saying that ''elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere'' pose a danger to ''current and future generations,'' and it set limits on emissions from new vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said its regulation of tailpipe emissions also required regulation of emissions from stationary sources under two permitting programs. While acknowledging that the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act fit such emissions imperfectly, the agency said the law nonetheless compelled it to require permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clean Air Act says those programs cover all sources that can annually emit 100 tons or 250 tons of the relevant pollutant, a threshold that works tolerably well for conventional air pollutants like lead and carbon monoxide. But that threshold, applied to greenhouse gases, which are emitted in far greater amounts, would require the regulation of millions of sources of pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applying the law as written would increase the number of covered sources under one program to more than 80,000, from just hundreds, reaching commercial and residential sources and subjecting them to expenses averaging almost $60,000, according to a decision under review from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second program would reach six million sources, subjecting them to expenses of more than $20,000 each. The cost of administering the programs would rise to $21 billion from $62 million, and the new covered sources, Justice Scalia wrote, would face costs of $147 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said Congress could not have intended such an ''absurd result.'' Its solution was to raise the statutory emissions threshold to 75,000 to 100,000 tons per year, thus reaching far fewer facilities. This was, it said, a permissible exercise of discretion and one subject to tightening over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Scalia, writing for five justices, rejected that approach. ''It is hard to imagine a statutory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical thresholds at which the act requires,'' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Endorsing the agency's approach, he added, ''would deal a severe blow to the Constitution's separation of powers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Breyer, writing for the court's four-member liberal wing in a partial dissent on this point, said the agency's approach was a sensible attempt to apply the purpose of the Clean Air Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute had little immediate practical effect, as the other part of Justice Scalia's opinion, now speaking for seven justices, allowed the agency to get to largely the same place by a different route by sustaining regulation of carbon emissions from sources already subject to regulation for conventional pollutants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are not talking about extending E.P.A. jurisdiction over millions of previously unregulated entities,'' Justice Scalia wrote, ''but about moderately increasing the demands E.P.A. (or a state permitting authority) can make of entities already subject to its regulation.'' But he acknowledged that the two approaches are almost equally effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, dissented from that part of the decision, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 12-1146.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million homes and businesses along the nation's coasts could flood repeatedly before ultimately being destroyed. Entire states in the Southeast and the Corn Belt may lose much of their agriculture as farming shifts northward in a warming world. Heat and humidity will probably grow so intense that spending time outside will become physically dangerous, throwing industries like construction and tourism into turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the picture of what may happen to the United States economy in a world of unchecked global warming, according to a major new report being put forward Tuesday by a coalition of senior political and economic figures from the left, right and center, including three Treasury secretaries stretching back to the Nixon administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the issue of climate&nbsp;change has divided the American political landscape, pitting Republicans against Democrats and even fellow party members against one another, the unusual bipartisan alliance of political veterans said that the country -- and business leaders in particular -- must wake up to the enormous scale of the economic risk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The big ice sheets are melting; something's happening,'' George P. Shultz, who was Treasury secretary under President Richard M. Nixon and secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. He noted that he had grown concerned enough about global warming to put solar panels on his own California roof and to buy an electric car. ''I say we should take out an insurance policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Treasury secretaries -- including Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican who served under President George W. Bush, and Robert E. Rubin, a Democrat in the Clinton administration -- promised to help sound the alarm. All endorse putting a price on greenhouse gases, most likely by taxing emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I actually do believe that we're at a tipping point with the planet,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview at his home in Chicago. ''A lot of things are going to happen that none of us are going to like to see.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview in New York, Mr. Rubin urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to take a tougher stance in requiring that publicly held companies disclose the climate-related risks they may face. While many companies have started issuing such warnings to investors, the disclosures are often vague and inadequate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Here we have this existential threat that I really do think has the possibility of being catastrophic, and I don't think people have any sense of that,'' Mr. Rubin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign behind the new report, called Risky Business, is funded largely by three wealthy financiers who are strong advocates of action on global warming: Mr. Paulson, who with his wife, Wendy, has helped finance conservation efforts for decades; Thomas F. Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund executive and Democrat who is pushing to make global warming a central issue in political races around the country; and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who now urges cities to confront the threat of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They commissioned an economic modeling firm that often does work for the oil and gas industry, the Rhodium Group, to assemble a team of experts who carried out the risk analysis. Trevor Houser, a Rhodium partner who led the study, sought to insulate the findings from the political opinions of the sponsors, in part by setting up a committee of leading climate scientists and environmental economists who reviewed the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Houser called the analysis ''the most detailed modeling ever done on the impact of climate&nbsp;change on specific sectors of the U.S. economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it is unclear whether the new report, or the voices of the former Treasury secretaries, will have an effect on companies or investors, given that many decisions on Wall Street are driven by short-term considerations of profit and loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The largest companies are starting to realize climate&nbsp;change is a financial issue,'' said Mindy S. Lubber, who runs a Boston advocacy group called Ceres that seeks to focus investor attention on the economic risks. ''Are they radically changing yet? No. But we're making some progress, slowly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said the economic effects would vary substantially by region. Some colder states may actually benefit from higher temperatures in significant ways, including longer growing seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the likeliest projections, Mr. Houser said, the American economy will keep growing throughout this century despite the increasing economic drag from climate&nbsp;change. So people in the future will probably be wealthier than those of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the warming will nonetheless impose huge costs, the report said. Coastal counties, home to 40 percent of the nation's population, will take especially large hits from the rise of the sea, which could swallow more than $370 billion worth of property in Florida and Louisiana alone by the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If greenhouse gas emissions continue at a rapid pace, the report said, the global sea level could increase roughly a foot by 2050, and double or triple that by century's end. A rise of as much as six or eight feet cannot be entirely ruled out, but that is more likely in the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that land is sinking in Louisiana even faster than the sea is rising, 4.1 percent to 5.5 percent of all insurable property in that state will be below mean sea level by 2050, the report predicted. By 2100, that figure could reach 15 percent to 20 percent. In Florida, 1 percent to 5 percent of all properties could fall below sea level by 2100, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But long before homes and businesses along the coast are entirely inundated, the researchers said, owners will face escalating damages from flooding. That poses substantial risks to taxpayers, who subsidize the National Flood Insurance Program, which has already been put more than $20 billion in the red by storms of recent years. Coastal property owners have fought attempts by Congress to charge premiums reflecting the true hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study projected complex effects on American agriculture. It is possible that farm output will continue rising, the report found, as it has done for many decades -- but that increase may require huge shifts in where crops are grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With current agricultural practices, the losses could be substantial in the Southeast and the Corn Belt, as high temperatures and water stress take a toll on crops. That would have to be made up by an agricultural shift to the northern rim of the country, with states like North Dakota and Minnesota potentially being net winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in parts of the country, farmers and other outdoor laborers will face routinely dangerous working conditions as summers grow longer and hotter, the report found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If emissions continue apace, the combination of heat and humidity projected for some regions, particularly the Southeast, at century's end means that anyone working outside at certain times will face a high risk of life-threatening heat stroke. And in the 22nd century, much of the eastern half of the country could face these conditions for weeks on end, the researchers predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the economic consequences would probably be substantial, Mr. Houser's group essentially gave up on trying to attach hard numbers to that particular hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You shouldn't be thinking about that risk in economic terms,'' Mr. Houser said. ''That's just: What kind of world do we want to live in?''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration made public a memo explaining the rationale behind a 2011 drone strike that killed an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen, The New York Times reports. &quot;But the rationale provides little confidence that the lethal action was taken with real care,&quot; the editorial board writes. &quot;Instead, the memo turns out to be a slapdash pastiche of legal theories - some based on obscure interpretations of British and Israeli law - that was clearly tailored to the desired result.&quot; The board remains unpersuaded that Mr. Awlaki's due-process rights were given proper consideration. &quot;More documents must be made public. The public is still in the dark on too many vital questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other significant viewpoints from around the world:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who oppose the E.P.A's bureaucratic, rulebound approach to cutting carbon dioxide cannot rely on the courts to preserve the status quo,&quot; writes The Washington Post. &quot;They need to abandon the nihilistic refusal to address climate&nbsp;change that has prevailed in Congress and propose a more economically rational strategy.&quot; The Post believes the E.P.A.'s rules provide a decent foundation for combating climate&nbsp;change: &quot;But they are neither efficient enough nor ambitious enough to be the comprehensive national climate policy the country needs. The agency's rules are as economically rational as the law will allow. But Congress could do much better by legislating a market-based approach to carbon dioxide regulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The search for the kidnapped teenagers and their abductors is indeed the supreme goal,&quot; The Haaretz editorial board writes, regarding three missing Israelis the government believes are in the hands of Hamas operatives. &quot;But 10 days after the kidnapping, it's permissible to ask what Israel really wants to achieve through this operation. Is this demonstration of force - which has included deploying thousands of soldiers in the Hebron area and beyond, house-to-house searches and hunting through cellars and caves - really meant to find the abducted teens, or is it meant to create a routine of domination and intimidation as a form of collective punishment?&quot; The board calls on government officials to refrain from using this tragedy as a military or political showcase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go to your freezer and find Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods' frozen shrimp products bought at Costco, Wal-Mart or other major retailers, chances are good you'll see the end of a food supply chain that began with slave-staffed ships registered in Thailand,&quot; The Los Angeles Times reports. In this complex high-seas slavery system, &quot;human traffickers lure workers from poor Southeast Asian countries with promises of jobs in Thailand. Instead, the smugglers sell the laborers to ship captains, who force them to harvest fish to be ground into meal and sold as feed to shrimp farms whose products ultimately end up in consumers' kitchens.&quot; The editorial board applauds the United States &nbsp;for criticizing the Thai government for allowing the practice to continue, &quot;and it should continue to press the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There could be no clearer evidence that Egyptian society is still in a state of civil war than the verdicts which Egyptian judges have been handing down in recent cases,&quot; writes The Guardian. In particular, the editorial board condemns the sentencing of three Al Jazeera journalists yesterday on what the board views as trumped up charges. &quot;The journalists were accused of falsely suggesting that Egypt is a deeply divided nation, yet these perverted verdicts prove just that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Explaining an alleged &amp;#8220;deafening silence&amp;#8221; on a difficult policy debate. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the &quot;Room to Grow&quot; collection of reform conservative essays dropped last month, some of the most frequent criticisms from liberals focused on topics that the book did not address: In particular, comprehensive immigration reform (the subject of my last post) and climate&nbsp;change legislation. Vox's Matt Yglesias, for instance, thought it noteworthy a a book &quot;hailed as representing the best, freshest conservative thinking on the pressing issues of the day&quot; has &quot;nothing to say&quot; on how American policymakers should tackle climate&nbsp;change, and he offered the following theory as to why:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thought process that ended with this approach is easy enough to understand. Whether climate&nbsp;change is a massive conspiracy orchestrated by Al Gore, 99 percent of scientists, and a dazzling array of foreign governments or a genuine problem is hotly debated inside the conservative movement. Whether or not fossil-fuel producers should be hampered in their activities by regulatory concern about pollution, by contrast, is not controversial. For smart, up-and-coming conservatives to mention climate&nbsp;change, they would have to pick a side on the controversial issue. Do they sound like rubes by siding with the conspiracy theorists, or do they alienate the rubes by acknowledging the basic facts and the coming up with some other reason to favor inaction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The optimal choice is not to choose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... It's no surprise to learn that American politics is increasingly polarized, but nowhere has this change come harder or faster than on climate. Just a few years ago, the GOP's presidential nominee, John McCain, ran on a fairly robust climate&nbsp;change platform. Now even the most forward-thinking elements of the conservative coalition have simply disappeared the issue from the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would say that the first half of this response is silly, but the second half gets at an important point. The suggestion that reform conservatives are somehow trying to play some kind of cautious political-reputational game by avoiding talking about the issue is not, I would submit, borne out by the evidence: If that were the case, one would expect them to ignore Yglesias's objection and the issues it raises, but instead it produced an extended response from the author of the &quot;Room to Grow&quot; chapter on energy, Adam White - which came out at the same time that Ramesh Ponnuru and Reihan Salam, reformocons both, were devoting their columns to the issue - which in turn fed into a lively multi-author debate whose most recent installment, from the prolific-on-this-issue Jim Manzi,&nbsp;you can find here. For people disguising their views on the issue and choosing a &quot;deafening silence&quot; over engagement, the &quot;Room to Grow&quot; folks need to work a lot harder at keeping quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Yglesias isn't wrong that those views look strikingly different from John McCain's position in 2007 or so, or that climate&nbsp;change, like immigration reform, is a place where reformocon policy wonks part ways with many moderate Republicans&nbsp;- like Hank Paulson, for instance, who just penned a pro-carbon tax op-ed in this newspaper&nbsp;- on the question of what issues a remodeled G.O.P. needs to emphasize and grapple with most urgently. That is, while reform conservatives aren't hiding their views on climate&nbsp;change, they do tend to think it's a second-order issue for the moment&nbsp;- which is probably why, in a book written with immediate 2014/2016 debates in mind, the issue did not feature prominently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now you might ask: How can anyone believe that the fate of the earth is a second-order issue?&nbsp;Well, I don't believe that; I do, however, believe that the contours of the climate policy debate do not merit that &quot;fate of the earth&quot; framing they're given, and I also think (and have argued previously) that events since 2007 have substantially weakened the case for a McCain or Paulson-style climate bill. So I'm pretty comfortable being associated with a political mini-movement that doesn't have &quot;figure out a market-friendly plan for limiting greenhouse gases&quot; that high on its policy agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me use an analogy to explain the thinking behind this view. Imagine that someone comes door-to-door selling you an insurance policy against a future peril. They make a strong case that the peril they've identified is real and likely to have deleterious effects on your family's way of life at some point in the future. You're feeling relatively flush, with good financial prospects going forward, and so you're inclined to buy whatever policy they're offering. But then they show you the details of their projections, and after you've gone over the math - their math&nbsp;-&nbsp;a few times you realize that even if the policy works exactly as designed&nbsp;the cost-benefit equation is a little murkier, and the dangers of inaction may be a lot less apocalyptic, than their rhetoric suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which, okay, they're salesmen, fair enough, and there are lots of unknown risks associated with the worst-case scenarios, so you're still inclined to consider signing up. But then they tell that in order for their policy to work at all, first you have to sign up for it, taking on at least some costs no matter what, and then they (with your help) have to sign up everybody in your neighborhood, making whatever tweaks to the policy are necessary to bring all of your neighbors (some of whom you don't know well, some of whom you hate, many of whom have radically different financial situations from your own) on board. And looking again at their own numbers, you realize that even if this process works, it promises to create a scenario, after all of the tweaks and negotiations, in which the final real-world costs of the policy (for you, and maybe everybody) are very likely to exceed the benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the upshot is that by purchasing the policy, you're hedging against unknown risks with a program that almost certainly won't work the way its advocates assert, and might very well not work at all. But, again, you're feeling flush enough and the catastrophic scenarios are worrying enough that it seems like you should be at least considering the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is roughly where the climate debate stood in 2007. Now extend the analogy further: What's happened since then? Well, a few things: You've discovered that you are not, in fact, as rich as you thought when the salesman first came around, and your future prospects aren't brightening nearly as fast as you would like. You've watched the salesman fill in some of the practical details of the policy that you'd be buying, and the direct cost-benefit ratio for your family turns out to be uglier than when it was just a sketch. Meanwhile, while you've been trying to decide whether to go ahead and buy it, you've made as much progress (or more) reducing your neighborhood's risk levels -&nbsp;relying&nbsp;on your initiative and at a lower cost&nbsp;-&nbsp;as a group of your neighbors who did go ahead and buy a version of the policy (and for whom it hasn't worked out particularly well). Also, you recently held a neighborhood-wide meeting on the question of whether everyone can get on board with the insurance plan, which was not exactly a festivalof comity and which produced more vague promises than actual cooperation.&nbsp;And then finally, the progression of the trend that you're being asked to pay out to hedge against has diverged, fairly persistently, from what the people selling the policy predicted a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where does this leave us? One answer is that nothing meaningful has changed, and that the dangers (some of them, yes, already apparent) are great enough that there's still no choice but to buy the policy and try to make the whole apparatus work&nbsp;- which, in a modified-limited form, is what&nbsp;the person currently running your household's finances has just decided to go ahead and do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think reasonable people can differ with this kind of &quot;something must be done, this is at least something, therefore we must do it&quot; take. Do the climate policy options on the table pass a searching cost-benefit analysis? Not so far as I can tell, no.&nbsp;Are we flush at the moment, with plenty of fiscal and economic room to make bad policy bets? No, I do not think we are. Is there a case for focusing first on areas where the problems in our common life are more immediate, and the benefits from wise policy to our household/nation are much clearer - focusing on finding and creating, as it were, more &quot;room to grow&quot; -&nbsp;before we lock ourselves into anti-growth measures with highly uncertain returns?&nbsp;Yes, I think there is. Is there reason to hope that this broadly-shared-prosperity-first approach might actually yield better returns, a better hedge against risk, than a regulation-first strategy? On the evidence of recent history, I'd say yes again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These answers are obviously subject to revision - trends can change, risks can increase, cost-benefit calculations can be altered&nbsp;-&nbsp;but for now they're what reform conservatism offers on this issue. We could be wrong; indeed, we could be badly wrong, in which case we'll deserve to be judged harshly for misplacing priorities in the face of real perils, real threats. But on the evidence available the moment, I'm willing to argue that we have our priorities in order, and the other side's allegedly forward-looking agenda does not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary and a lifelong Republican, had an Op-Ed article about climate policy in The New York Times. In the article, he declared that man-made climate&nbsp;change is ''the challenge of our time,'' and called for a national tax on carbon emissions to encourage conservation and the adoption of green technologies. Considering the prevalence of climate denial within today's G.O.P., and the absolute opposition to any kind of tax increase, this was a brave stand to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not nearly brave enough. Emissions taxes are the Economics 101 solution to pollution problems; every economist I know would start cheering wildly if Congress voted in a clean, across-the-board carbon tax. But that isn't going to happen in the foreseeable future. A carbon tax may be the best thing we could do, but we won't actually do it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there are a number of second-best things (in the technical sense, as I'll explain shortly) that we're either doing already or might do soon. And the question for Mr. Paulson and other conservatives who consider themselves environmentalists is whether they're willing to accept second-best answers, and in particular whether they're willing to accept second-best answers implemented by the other party. If they aren't, their supposed environmentalism is an empty gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me give some examples of what I'm talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, consider rules like fuel efficiency standards, or ''net metering'' mandates requiring that utilities buy back the electricity generated by homeowners' solar panels. Any economics student can tell you that such rules are inefficient compared with the clean incentives provided by an emissions tax. But we don't have an emissions tax, and fuel efficiency rules and net metering reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So a question for conservative environmentalists: Do you support the continuation of such mandates, or are you with the business groups (spearheaded by the Koch brothers) campaigning to eliminate them and impose fees on home solar installations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, consider government support for clean energy via subsidies and loan guarantees. Again, if we had an appropriately high emissions tax such support might not be necessary (there would be a case for investment promotion even then, but never mind). But we don't have such a tax. So the question is, Are you O.K. with things like loan guarantees for solar plants, even though we know that some loans will go bad, Solyndra-style?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, what about the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal that it use its regulatory authority to impose large reductions in emissions from power plants? The agency is eager to pursue market-friendly solutions to the extent it can -- basically by imposing emissions limits on states, while encouraging states or groups of states to create cap-and-trade systems that effectively put a price on carbon. But this will nonetheless be a partial approach that addresses only one source of greenhouse gas emissions. Are you willing to support this partial approach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way: Readers well versed in economics will recognize that I'm talking about what is technically known as the ''theory of the second best.'' According to this theory, distortions in one market -- in this case, the fact that there are large social costs to carbon emissions, but individuals and firms don't pay a price for emitting carbon -- can justify government intervention in other, related markets. Second-best arguments have a dubious reputation in economics, because the right policy is always to eliminate the primary distortion, if you can. But sometimes you can't, and this is one of those times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings me back to Mr. Paulson. In his Op-Ed he likens the climate crisis to the financial crisis he helped confront in 2008. Unfortunately, it's not a very good analogy: In the financial crisis he could credibly argue that disaster was only days away, while the climate catastrophe will unfold over many decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So let me suggest a different analogy, one that he probably won't like. In policy terms, climate action -- if it happens at all -- will probably look like health reform. That is, it will be an awkward compromise dictated in part by the need to appease special interests, not the clean, simple solution you would have implemented if you could have started from scratch. It will be the subject of intense partisanship, relying overwhelmingly on support from just one party, and will be the subject of constant, hysterical attacks. And it will, if we're lucky, nonetheless do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did I mention that health reform is clearly working, despite its flaws?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for Mr. Paulson and those of similar views is whether they're willing to go along with that kind of imperfection. If they are, welcome aboard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hot weather kills more Americans than all other natural disasters combined, and the casualties continue to climb despite decades of warnings about how to recognize the signs of heat stress and take prompt corrective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With climate&nbsp;change, some experts predict ever-worsening summer heat waves and even more related illnesses and deaths. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that excessive heat caused by climate&nbsp;change could kill more than 150,000 Americans by the end of the century in the 40 largest cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As carbon pollution continues to rise, the number of dangerously hot days each summer will increase even further, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of lives lost,&quot; the council reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme heat claims an average of 117 lives each year, but the real incidence is likely far higher. In addition, about 1,800 people die from illnesses made worse by heat, the council estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Death rates from many causes rise during heat waves that are related to heat but not reported as such,&quot; said Dr. Christopher B. Colwell, director of emergency medicine at Denver Health Medical Center. &quot;Lots of deaths that occur during heat waves are attributed to natural causes like heart attacks, kidney disease or respiratory disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially at risk are the elderly, young children, athletes of all ages and weekend warriors whose bodies are not adapted to heat stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As common as the problem is, it's not common enough to grab people's attention until it hits close to home,&quot; Dr. Colwell said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a high-profile death, like that of Korey Stringer, 27, a Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle who suffered heatstroke after a summer morning practice in 2001, has not prompted all coaches to take necessary precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many coaches have held practices in the heat for years and no one died, so they think a bigger deal is being made of the problem than it really is,&quot; Dr. Colwell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six years before Stringer's death, 19 high school and college players died from heatstroke, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. Too often, a player suffering from heat exhaustion, the first stage of a potentially life-threatening heat illness, is sent back on the field after a brief rest instead of being benched for the day or longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While deaths of healthy young athletes tend to be well publicized, the elderly are much more likely to succumb to extreme heat. Dr. Colwell explained that with age, the body's ability to cool itself declines. Among other changes, blood vessels don't dilate as readily to allow heat to escape, a problem made worse by conditions like congestive heart failure and peripheral vascular disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many older people without air-conditioning or fans may not know when to get out of the heat, or they may be physically unable to leave an overheated dwelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dehydration, a common problem among the elderly as well as among younger people who exercise strenuously, raises the risk of heat illness by diminishing the body's ability to lose heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medications taken by many older people also increase their vulnerability to heat stress, among them beta blockers prescribed for high blood pressure and anticholinergics used to treat lung problems and urinary incontinence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other drugs, too, can contribute to a hypersensitivity to heat, including lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines and antispasmodics. Recreational drugs, like cocaine, amphetamines, PCP and alcohol, can be a problem as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat illness often occurs several days into a heat wave, as the effects on the body accumulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body normally operates within a rather narrow temperature range. If body temperature rises above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, enzymes begin to break down and normal metabolic processes are disrupted. When Stringer collapsed, his temperature registered above 108 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Body heat is dissipated through four mechanisms: conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation. When the air temperature rises above 98.6 degrees, heat cannot be conducted away from the body unless a significant breeze creates a convection current, or windchill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat radiates from the body when blood vessels are maximally dilated and the air temperature is lower than body temperature. But the most effective natural coolant is sweat; as it collects on the skin and evaporates, it draws heat from the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of heat illness rises with the heat index, a combined measure of air temperature and relative humidity. When the humidity is high (or too much clothing is worn), sweat simply rolls off the skin without evaporating and cooling it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coaches, take note: depending on athletes' ages, intensity of activity and degree of acclimatization, you should consider canceling practice and games when the heat index exceeds 105, experts say. City dwellers are most at risk during heat waves because paved surfaces, tall buildings and minimal tree cover enhance heat absorption, creating a &quot;heat island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat illness is a form of hyperthermia, defined as a rise in core body temperature. But it does not respond to fever-reducing medications, making it extremely important to recognize heat exhaustion, an early sign of trouble. Common complaints include fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache, nausea and muscle cramps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Colwell explained that the brain's cerebellum is especially sensitive to heat, which explains the early signs of a heatstroke: unsteady gait, confusion and disorientation. Heatstroke, characterized by a rise in body temperature above 104 degrees, has a death rate as high as 50 percent. Symptoms typically include a change in mental status, like delirium, seizures or even coma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the elderly, heatstroke most often develops gradually, over several hot days. But among otherwise healthy people engaged in strenuous exercise, it tends to occur suddenly, within minutes to hours, which demands particular attention to early symptoms.                      </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: The number of Australians who consider global warming a &quot;serious&quot; concern has increased for the second year running, while the Australian government remains a laggard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year has seen a resurgence of &quot;serious and pressing&quot; concern over global warming with the second consecutive increase seeing Australians' views&nbsp;raise five points to 45 percent, and an additional 38 percent who support the proposition that &quot;the problem of global&nbsp;warming should be addressed&quot; gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serious&quot; concerns over global warming have rebounded and 63% of Australians believe we should take a leadership role http://t.co/iblcxrPlFg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) June 21, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results are in the latest Lowy Institute Poll, an annual survey of attitudes that has been tracking views since 2006. It looks at issues of a national security and geopolitical nature. The entire results are here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming is listed as a &quot;critical threat&quot; to Australia's &quot;vital interests&quot; by 46 percent of survey respondents, and ranks behind concerns about terrorism, nuclear threats from neighbours and Iran, and asylum seekers. Younger Australians are particularly concerned about global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Australians believe our government should take a leading role to reduce carbon pollution. http://t.co/9qNJ7HfXbApic.twitter.com/3UDNckdlyV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) June 21, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These poll results make sense when you realise that Australia has experienced unprecedented heatwaves, extreme weather and most recently a &quot;warm&quot; Autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian prime minister Tony Abbott recently visited the US and Canada, where he pledged to lock Australia into a long-term, high carbon pollution future of fossil fuel dependency. He also used the opportunity to laud his ambition to abolish Australia's&nbsp;carbon price legislation,&nbsp;saying carbon prices &quot;clobber&quot; the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Liberal-National party government's spin-doctors worked overtime to sell a positive message about Abbott's time in the USA, the reality is that the prime minister is seriously out of step with our largest and most powerful ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Obama in a recent speech&nbsp;ripped into climate&nbsp;change deniers, labelling global warming as &quot;one of the most significant long-term challenges that our country and our planet faces&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made a powerful moral case for action and called a real and powerful reason for conservative climate denial:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the question is not whether we need to act. The overwhelming judgment of science, accumulated and measured and reviewed over decades, has put that question to rest. The question is whether we have the will to act before it's too late. For if we fail to protect the world we leave not just to my children, but to your children and your children's children, we will fail one of our primary reasons for being on this world in the first place. And that is to leave the world a little bit better for the next generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And today's Congress, though, is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence about climate&nbsp;change. They will tell you it is a hoax, or a fad. One member of Congress actually says the world is cooling. There was one member of Congress who mentioned a theory involving &quot;dinosaur flatulence&quot; -- which I won't get into. (Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, their view may be wrong -- and a fairly serious threat to everybody's future -- but at least they have the brass to say what they actually think. There are some who also duck the question. They say -- when they're asked about climate&nbsp;change, they say, &quot;Hey, look, I'm not a scientist.&quot; And I'll translate that for you. What that really means is, &quot;I know that manmade climate&nbsp;change really is happening, but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot, so I'm not going to admit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming is a vital and security threat, especially to Australia, which is uniquely vulnerable to the effects of climate&nbsp;change. Serious people in the global military elite are increasingly concerned that global warming will start, increase or exacerbate armed conflict. A May 2014&nbsp;report by 16 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals who compose the CNA Corporation's Military Advisory Board (MAB) said that&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;climate&nbsp;change impacts are already accelerating instability in vulnerable regions&quot;. It is widely accepted that drought contributed to the civil war in Syria for example, and increasingly scarce water resources in the Middle East will likely cause more conflicts than oil in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, global warming is also a major economic threat. In Australia, climate risks would put at threat as many as 584,000 jobs and $78 billion in economic value in the state of Victoria alone, according to the Future Economy reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fossil fuel addiction is putting the jobs of 584,000 Victorian people at risk: http://t.co/AR0pdZPqnUpic.twitter.com/ReWtc7CmU4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) June 21, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO of conservative Committee for Economic Development of Australia, Stephen Martin also recently highlighted the dire economic risks of runaway climate&nbsp;change, saying in June, &quot;the undeniable fact is that Australia's economy will be critically exposed on two significant economic fronts if we do not ensure an appropriate response to climate&nbsp;change.&quot; He made the point, in contradistinction to Tony Abbott, that global warming has &quot;everything to with economics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Abbott is a profoundly unpopular prime minister, leading an unpopular party, that is pursuing an unpopular budget, underpinned by an unpopular ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attitudes and statements he expressed overseas, especially about fossil fuels and global warming reject many basic Australian&nbsp;national beliefs. Most Australians are concerned about global warming, support renewable energy and want Australia to be a leader in reducing emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead we have a prime minister who says global warming&nbsp;is &quot;crap&quot;, has appointed a climate denier to review Australia's renewable energy target, and tried&nbsp;to stymie global action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is a time for weighing evidence and a time for acting. And if there's one thing I've learned throughout my work in finance, government and conservation, it is to act before problems become too big to manage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too many years, we failed to rein in the excesses building up in the nation's financial markets. When the credit bubble burst in 2008, the damage was devastating. Millions suffered. Many still do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're making the same mistake today with climate&nbsp;change. We're staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy. The warning signs are clear and growing more urgent as the risks go unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a crisis we can't afford to ignore. I feel as if I'm watching as we fly in slow motion on a collision course toward a giant mountain. We can see the crash coming, and yet we're sitting on our hands rather than altering course.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to act now, even though there is much disagreement, including from members of my own Republican Party, on how to address this issue while remaining economically competitive. They're right to consider the economic implications. But we must not lose sight of the profound economic risks of doing nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response. We can do this by putting a price on emissions of carbon dioxide -- a carbon tax. Few in the United States now pay to emit this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere we all share. Putting a price on emissions will create incentives to develop new, cleaner energy technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that the United States can't solve this problem alone. But we're not going to be able to persuade other big carbon polluters to take the urgent action that's needed if we're not doing everything we can do to slow our carbon emissions and mitigate our risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was secretary of the Treasury when the credit bubble burst, so I think it's fair to say that I know a little bit about risk, assessing outcomes and problem-solving. Looking back at the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008, it is easy to see the similarities between the financial crisis and the climate challenge we now face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are building up excesses (debt in 2008, greenhouse gas emissions that are trapping heat now). Our government policies are flawed (incentivizing us to borrow too much to finance homes then, and encouraging the overuse of carbon-based fuels now). Our experts (financial experts then, climate scientists now) try to understand what they see and to model possible futures. And the outsize risks have the potential to be tremendously damaging (to a globalized economy then, and the global climate now).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, we narrowly avoided an economic catastrophe at the last minute by rescuing a collapsing financial system through government action. But climate&nbsp;change is a more intractable problem. The carbon dioxide we're sending into the atmosphere remains there for centuries, heating up the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means the decisions we're making today -- to continue along a path that's almost entirely carbon-dependent -- are locking us in for long-term consequences that we will not be able change but only adapt to, at enormous cost. To protect New York City from rising seas and storm surges is expected to cost at least $20 billion initially, and eventually far more. And that's just one coastal city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York can reasonably predict those obvious risks. When I worry about risks, I worry about the biggest ones, particularly those that are difficult to predict -- the ones I call small but deep holes. While odds are you will avoid them, if you do fall in one, it's a long way down and nearly impossible to claw your way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists have identified a number of these holes -- potential thresholds that, once crossed, could cause sweeping, irreversible changes. They don't know exactly when we would reach them. But they know we should do everything we can to avoid them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, observations are catching up with years of scientific models, and the trends are not in our favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than 10 years ago, the best analysis projected that melting Arctic sea ice would mean nearly ice-free summers by the end of the 21st century. Now the ice is melting so rapidly that virtually ice-free Arctic summers could be here in the next decade or two. The lack of reflective ice will mean that more of the sun's heat will be absorbed by the oceans, accelerating warming of both the oceans and the atmosphere, and ultimately raising sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse, in May, two separate studies discovered that one of the biggest thresholds has already been reached. The West Antarctic ice sheet has begun to melt, a process that scientists estimate may take centuries but that could eventually raise sea levels by as much as 14 feet. Now that this process has begun, there is nothing we can do to undo the underlying dynamics, which scientists say are ''baked in.'' And 10 years from now, will other thresholds be crossed that scientists are only now contemplating?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that there is uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of these risks and many others. But those who claim the science is unsettled or action is too costly are simply trying to ignore the problem. We must see the bigger picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of a crisis is its unpredictability. And as we all witnessed during the financial crisis, a chain reaction of cascading failures ensued from one intertwined part of the system to the next. It's easy to see a single part in motion. It's not so easy to calculate the resulting domino effect. That sort of contagion nearly took down the global financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that experience indelibly affecting my perspective, viewing climate&nbsp;change in terms of risk assessment and risk management makes clear to me that taking a cautiously conservative stance -- that is, waiting for more information before acting -- is actually taking a very radical risk. We'll never know enough to resolve all of the uncertainties. But we know enough to recognize that we must act now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a businessman, not a climatologist. But I've spent a considerable amount of time with climate scientists and economists who have devoted their careers to this issue. There is virtually no debate among them that the planet is warming and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farseeing business leaders are already involved in this issue. It's time for more to weigh in. To add reliable financial data to the science, I've joined with the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, and the retired hedge fund manager Tom Steyer on an economic analysis of the costs of inaction across key regions and economic sectors. Our goal for the Risky Business project -- starting with a new study that will be released this week -- is to influence business and investor decision making worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to craft national policy that uses market forces to provide incentives for the technological advances required to address climate&nbsp;change. As I've said, we can do this by placing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Many respected economists, of all ideological persuasions, support this approach. We can debate the appropriate pricing and policy design and how to use the money generated. But a price on carbon would change the behavior of both individuals and businesses. At the same time, all fossil fuel -- and renewable energy -- subsidies should be phased out. Renewable energy can outcompete dirty fuels once pollution costs are accounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of my political party worry that pricing carbon is a ''big government'' intervention. In fact, it will reduce the role of government, which, on our present course, increasingly will be called on to help communities and regions affected by climate-related disasters like floods, drought-related crop failures and extreme weather like tornadoes, hurricanes and other violent storms. We'll all be paying those costs. Not once, but many times over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is already happening, with taxpayer dollars rebuilding homes damaged by Hurricane Sandy and the deadly Oklahoma tornadoes. This is a proper role of government. But our failure to act on the underlying problem is deeply misguided, financially and logically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a future with more severe storms, deeper droughts, longer fire seasons and rising seas that imperil coastal cities, public funding to pay for adaptations and disaster relief will add significantly to our fiscal deficit and threaten our long-term economic security. So it is perverse that those who want limited government and rail against bailouts would put the economy at risk by ignoring climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is short-termism. There is a tendency, particularly in government and politics, to avoid focusing on difficult problems until they balloon into crisis. We would be fools to wait for that to happen to our climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you run a company, you want to hand it off in better shape than you found it. In the same way, just as we shouldn't leave our children or grandchildren with mountains of national debt and unsustainable entitlement programs, we shouldn't leave them with the economic and environmental costs of climate&nbsp;change. Republicans must not shrink from this issue. Risk management is a conservative principle, as is preserving our natural environment for future generations. We are, after all, the party of Teddy Roosevelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS problem can't be solved without strong leadership from the developing world. The key is cooperation between the United States and China -- the two biggest economies, the two biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and the two biggest consumers of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to developing new technologies, no country can innovate like America. And no country can test new technologies and roll them out at scale quicker than China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two nations must come together on climate. The Paulson Institute at the University of Chicago, a ''think-and-do tank'' I founded to help strengthen the economic and environmental relationship between these two countries, is focused on bridging this gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already have a head start on the technologies we need. The costs of the policies necessary to make the transition to an economy powered by clean energy are real, but modest relative to the risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax on carbon emissions will unleash a wave of innovation to develop technologies, lower the costs of clean energy and create jobs as we and other nations develop new energy products and infrastructure. This would strengthen national security by reducing the world's dependence on governments like Russia and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is the challenge of our time. Each of us must recognize that the risks are personal. We've seen and felt the costs of underestimating the financial bubble. Let's not ignore the climate bubble.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Two climate scientists explore the idea of a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; path in the age of man, the Anthropocene. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just catching up with reactions from two climate and sustainability analysts (Michael Tobis and Curt Stager) to my recent talk charting a &quot;good&quot; path through the age of us, the Anthropocene, and Clive Hamilton's blunt critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stager - a hybrid of climate scientist, ecologist and author (and musician) - posted a comment that is worth elevating here as a &quot;Your Dot&quot; contribution:&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethicist Clive Hamilton's premise that seeing anything but catastrophe in an Anthropocene future is &quot;un-scientific&quot; is itself unscientific - a value judgment, not a statement of fact. As a climate scientist, I see many changes coming that worry me, but I also try not to confuse my feelings about them with the full complexity of reality, and I do see some rays of hope amid the storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Science demands that we consider more than what most grabs our attention, and as with past global changes one's loss is another's gain; this makes rigorous ethical analysis more difficult than the science itself. As Arctic sea ice species wane, southern taxa are re-colonizing waters their ancestors knew in past warm periods, and as parts of Bangladesh submerge Greenlanders find new opportunities. Hamilton's response is understandable, but he seems to forget what &quot;scientific&quot; means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from reactions to my book, &quot;Deep Future: The Next 100,000 Years of Life on Earth,&quot; it is often strict scientific views of such changes that most upset people who, as Andy suggests, appear to hope for the worst. Our responses to global change reflect who we are, what we know (or think we know), and our emotional wiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this turbulent dawn of the Anthropocene when our thoughts and actions trigger massive, long-lasting changes for better and for worse, recognizing what is or is not &quot;science&quot; is crucial to understanding what is happening and thus - by my own ethical lights - a responsibility, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Tobis, who is often a critic of my thinking on climate&nbsp;change science, creditably took the time to watch my talk and offered a constructive reaction on his Planet 3.0 blog. Here's an excerpt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[T]he argument is whether it is permissible to juxtapose the words &quot;good&quot; and &quot;anthropocene.&quot; But &quot;good&quot; is such a vague word that objecting to it seems to me a very weak posture. Indeed, in his Dot Earth piece he mentions that he is using &quot;good&quot; in an ethical sense, not in a sense of outcomes. He says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was invited to give the opening talk, which I called &quot;Paths to a 'Good' Anthropocene&quot; - with quotation marks around the adjective &quot;good&quot; to stress that values determine choices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do I entirely agree that we can have an ethically &quot;good&quot; future, I also believe that we can have an actually &quot;good&quot; future in terms of dignity, sustainability and joy. Some say it is automatic, and we should just eschew meddling with the corporate economy which will inevitably deliver left to its devices. I don't believe that for a minute. A good outcome will require a lot of work and a fair amount of courage. But if I thought it was out of reach, I'd go all doomer and hide in a cave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What motivates me to keep going is the following by Bruce Sterling:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our capacities are tremendous. Eventually, it is within our technical ability to create factories that clean the air as they work, cars that give off drinkable water, industry that creates parks instead of dumps, or even monitoring systems that allow nature to thrive in our cities, neighborhoods, lawns and homes. An industry that is not just &quot;sustainable,&quot; but enhances the world. The natural world should be better for our efforts and our ingenuity. It's not too much to ask. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You and I will never live to see a future world with those advanced characteristics. The people who will be living in it will pretty much take it for granted, anyway. But that is a worthy vision for today's technologists: because that is wise governance for a digitally conquered world. That is is not tyranny. That is legitimacy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without vision, the people perish. So we need our shimmering, prizes, goals to motivate ourselves, but the life is never in the prize. The living part, the fun part, is all in the wrangling. Those dark cliffs looming ahead - that is the height of your achievement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need to leap into another way of life. The technical impetus is here. We are changing, but to what end? The question we must face is: what do we want? We should want to abandon that which has no future. We should blow right through mere sustainability. We should desire a world of enhancement. That is what should come next. We should want to expand the options of those who will follow us. We don't need more dead clutter to entomb in landfills. We need more options. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It needs to happen. It must happen. It is going to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the Planet3.0 Manifesto, in case you missed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is that Polyannish? I don't think so. Is it true? Well, maybe not the part about hydrogen cars, but basically yes. Our capacities are immense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future is not yet written. We must mourn our losses, but it is far too soon to be giving up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those dark cliffs looming ahead? That is the height of your achievement.                       </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Earth to Hank Paulson: who do you think you&amp;#8217;re talking to? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hank Paulson has a very sad opinion piece about climate&nbsp;change in today's Times. We must act, he declares, in the same way we acted to contain the financial crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a dubious analogy: the 2008 crisis was fast-moving, and people like Paulson could credibly warn that unless we acted the whole world economy would fall apart in a matter of days. Meanwhile, climate&nbsp;change is slow but inexorable, with enormous momentum; by the time it becomes undeniable that there's a crisis, it will be too late to avoid catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not the sad part about Paulson's piece; no, what's sad is that he imagines that anyone in the party he still claims as his own is listening. Earth to Paulson: the GOP you imagine, which respects science and is willing to consider even market-friendly government interventions like carbon taxes, no longer exists. The reins of power now rest firmly, irreversibly, in the hands of men who believe that climate&nbsp;change is a hoax concocted by liberal scientists to justify Big Government, who refuse to acknowledge that government intervention to correct market failures can ever be justified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the state of U.S. politics today, climate action is entirely dependent on Democrats, With a Democrat in the White House, we got some movement through executive action; if Democrats eventually regain the House, there could be more. If Paulson believes that he can support Republicans while still pushing for climate action, he's just delusional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the Obama administration announced new rules aimed at cutting carbon pollution from power stations by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030&quot;. Never before has a US president attempted to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power stations and the move has been hailed by scientists and policymakers as an important step towards a global economy powered by clean energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urgent need to move away from energy produced by fossil fuels - such as coal, oil and gas - had been made abundantly clear earlier this year when the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change published a report that said the world needed to make a &quot;massive shift&quot; to renewable energy in order to curb climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, according to the International Energy Agency's latest figures, 82% of the world's energy is still produced by fossil fuels. So how can this &quot;massive shift&quot; to a renewables-based economy be achieved?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That question was at the centre of a roundtable debate, organised by the Guardian and sponsored by WWF. To begin the discussion, David Nussbaum, WWF UK's chief executive, told participants that his organisation had &quot;spent over 50 years safeguarding the natural world&quot;, but climate&nbsp;change threatened to undermine that work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWF had therefore produced a report that looked at whether the world could go fully renewable by 2050. &quot;The report said you could get extremely close&quot;, said Nussbaum, but it will require &quot;an awful lot of investment and an awful lot of change in the systems that countries use for their energy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal, oil and gas would obviously have to be phased out of the global energy mix and made as unappealing as possible for investors. Fortunately, he added, WWF was not alone in campaigning to stop money being invested in fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divestment campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants heard how the Fossil Free divestment movement, which aims to put pressure on public institutions to divest from fossil fuels, had been a remarkable success. &quot;A good number of institutional investors now have this on their agenda,&quot; said Ben Caldecott, programme director at the University of Oxford's Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of organisations such as the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which aims to highlight the financial risk associated with holding carbon-based assets that could become &quot;stranded&quot; due to policy changes designed to tackle climate&nbsp;change, was also held up as an example of momentum gathering behind the move to a clean energy economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell and ExxonMobil have even had to issue statements denying their assets will become stranded, participants heard. &quot;We've now got to the point where the FTSE is looking at a fossil-free index,&quot; said Nussbaum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Temperton, head of advisory at Climate&nbsp;Change Capital, highlighted the current state of the renewables industry, pointing to figures from Bloomberg New Energy Finance that showed global investment in clean energy stood at $254bn (&pound;150bn) last year, down from $286.2bn in 2012 and the record $317.9bn of 2011. This reduction was partly because &quot;the kit got cheaper&quot;, he said, adding that solar, in particular, was becoming more affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put those figures into context, it is estimated that $3tn are pumped into fossil fuels each year, once subsidies are taken into account. It is thought a further $1.2tn is being spent every year dealing with the effects of climate&nbsp;change - and that figure will continue to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewable energy is &quot;a growth market&quot;, said Dimitri Zenghelis, senior visiting fellow at the Grantham Research Institute at the LSE. &quot;But we haven't reached that takeoff stage, that critical mass where everybody says: 'This is inevitable.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is holding back that critical mass?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vivian Nicoli, investment director at Eiser, told delegates that her firm had recently canvassed key investors to find out if they would be interested in a specific renewables fund. Their answer, she said, was for the most part &quot;no&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors are very cautious because regulators often change renewable energy subsidies and tariffs, she said, which doesn't give investors the stability they are looking for. For example, governments often agree to pay more for electricity produced by renewables in order to encourage long-term investment in the industry, however, that price can often be reviewed or even scrapped when the political landscape changes. &quot;A more cohesive strategy at the national level would help,&quot; Nicoli added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate&nbsp;Change, agreed policy changes were harming the investment landscape. &quot;Retroactive changes have been the most-damaging thing to the market . . . they damage sentiment everywhere,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, despite uncertainty over tariffs and subsidies, all delegates agreed that the global political consensus was moving broadly away from fossil fuels to renewables. In Africa and Asia, this was being driven by a need to produce more electricity, often in remote areas where solar power was the best option. In China, the motive was to improve air quality and in western Europe, security of supply was an issue, the roundtable heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would these factors not encourage the big energy companies to hedge against policy shifts detrimental to their business model and start focusing on renewables? Scott McGregor, CEO at Camco Clean Energy, thought not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big energy companies are tankers -they only know how to do one thing,&quot; he said. &quot;The renewable sector has a different supply chain and management profile . . . even big utilities don't know how to do renewables, let alone the oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Templeton agreed: &quot;Oil companies should be good oil companies until we don't need them anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalable investments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the big energy companies were not going to lead the transition to a clean economy, then who would and how could this be achieved? For many delegates, it was important to create renewable investment vehicles that had the scale of a Shell or BP. Pension fund managers with enormous sums invested in these giants of the FTSE currently had no viable renewable-based alternative to transfer their funds into. As Templeton pointed out, when it comes to investments, renewables still sit in the &quot;alternative, alternative, alternative&quot; pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pfeifer suggested that governments and development banks had a role to play here helping to build scale in the renewables industry so companies become bigger and more attractive to institutional investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to mainstream these asset classes,&quot; agreed Oliver Griffiths, head of government affairs and policy at the Green Investment Bank. &quot;You need institutional investors to think (renewables) are much more mainstream than they are seen to be at the moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicoli also thought that government-backed institutions, such as the Green Investment Bank, could unblock investment. There are a lot of projects that are &quot;stuck&quot; and can't get over the line, she said. &quot;We're looking at the Green Investment Bank to get us over the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGregor didn't think the initial focus should be on institutional investors, who, he said, were not &quot;first movers&quot;. The renewables market is tiny, he added. &quot;The pension funds will be there when the industry is ready, but the industry needs to scale up.&quot; Until the industry develops, other sources of finance, such as venture capital funding, would be sufficient, he said. &quot;The money is not the issue, it's the product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finance to invest in renewable infrastructure projects is there, agreed Nicholas Pincott, a partner at legal firm Norton Rose Fulbright, but more work needed to be done to create the right environments for these projects to succeed. For example, delegates suggested community-owned energy projects similar to those in Germany, where communities generate their own energy from renewable sources, could be replicated in other countries to help bring the industry up to scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zenghelis aired concerns that a possible side effect of the move to renewables would be the price of coal coming down in countries with less stringent environmental policies in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many delegates, the only way to counter this was through a global carbon price, although there was disagreement around the table about how this could work in practice, given that Russia and the &quot;Stan&quot; states were still likely to dig these resources up. &quot;You need to find a way to prevent that stuff being burnt,&quot; Zenghelis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he added a note of optimism saying that if China and the US move heavily on renewables, &quot;it's game over&quot; for fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps Nicoli summed up the mood of participants best, likening the world's transition to a clean economy to an unstoppable train that has already left the station. &quot;It's going to happen,&quot; she said, &quot;because it makes economic sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: The man who trained over 66 countries in open source methods calls to re-invent intelligence to re-engineer Earth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert David Steele, former Marine, CIA case officer, and US co-founder of the US Marine Corps intelligence activity, is a man on a mission. But it's a mission that frightens the US intelligence establishment to its core.With 18 years experience working across the US intelligence community, followed by 20 more years in commercial intelligence and training, Steele's exemplary career has spanned almost all areas of both the clandestine world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele started off as a Marine Corps infantry and intelligence officer. After four years on active duty, he joined the CIA for about a decade before co-founding the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, where he was deputy director. Widely recognised as the leader of the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) paradigm, Steele went on to write the handbooks on OSINT for NATO, the US Defense Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Special Operations Forces. In passing, he personally trained 7,500 officers from over 66 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, despite opposition from the CIA, he obtained Marine Corps permission to organise a landmark international conference on open source intelligence - the paradigm of deriving information to support policy decisions not through secret activities, but from open public sources available to all. The conference was such a success it brought in over 620 attendees from the intelligence world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the CIA wasn't happy, and ensured that Steele was prohibited from running a second conference. The clash prompted him to resign from his position as second-ranking civilian in Marine Corps intelligence, and pursue the open source paradigm elsewhere. He went on to found and head up the Open Source Solutions Network Inc. and later the non-profit Earth Intelligence Network which runs the Public Intelligence Blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I first came across Steele when I discovered his Amazon review of my third book, The War on Truth: 9/11, Disinformation and the Anatomy of Terrorism. A voracious reader, Steele is the number 1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction across 98 categories. He also reviewed my latest book, A User's Guide to the Crisis of Civilization, but told me I'd overlooked an important early work - 'A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility, Report of the UN High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Steele presented a startling paper at the Libtech conference in New York, sponsored by the Internet Society and Reclaim. Drawing on principles set out in his latest book,The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth and Trust, he told the audience that all the major preconditions for revolution - set out in his 1976 graduate thesis - were now present in the United States and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele's book is a must-read, a powerful yet still pragmatic roadmap to a new civilisational paradigm that simultaneously offers a trenchant, unrelenting critique of the prevailing global order. His interdisciplinary 'whole systems' approach dramatically connects up the increasing corruption, inefficiency and unaccountability of the intelligence system and its political and financial masters with escalating inequalities and environmental crises. But he also offers a comprehensive vision of hope that activist networks like Reclaim are implementing today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are at the end of a five-thousand-year-plus historical process during which human society grew in scale while it abandoned the early indigenous wisdom councils and communal decision-making,&quot; he writes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Open Source Everything Manifesto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;Power was centralised in the hands of increasingly specialised 'elites' and 'experts' who not only failed to achieve all they promised but used secrecy and the control of information to deceive the public into allowing them to retain power over community resources that they ultimately looted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's capitalism, he argues, is inherently predatory and destructive:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the course of the last centuries, the commons was fenced, and everything from agriculture to water was commoditised without regard to the true cost in non-renewable resources. Human beings, who had spent centuries evolving away from slavery, were re-commoditised by the Industrial Era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open source everything, in this context, offers us the chance to build on what we've learned through industrialisation, to learn from our mistakes, and catalyse the re-opening of the commons, in the process breaking the grip of defunct power structures and enabling the possibility of prosperity for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharing, not secrecy, is the means by which we realise such a lofty destiny as well as create infinite wealth. The wealth of networks, the wealth of knowledge, revolutionary wealth - all can create a nonzero win-win Earth that works for one hundred percent of humanity. This is the 'utopia' that Buckminster Fuller foresaw, now within our reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal, he concludes, is to reject:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... concentrated illicitly aggregated and largely phantom wealth in favor of community wealth defined by community knowledge, community sharing of information, and community definition of truth derived in transparency and authenticity, the latter being the ultimate arbiter of shared wealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this unabashedly radical vision, Steele is hugely respected by senior military intelligence experts across the world. As a researcher at the US Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute, he has authored several monographs advocating the need for open source methods to transform the craft of intelligence. He has lectured to the US State Department and Department of Homeland Security as well as National Security Councils in various countries, and his new book has received accolades from senior intelligence officials across multiple countries including France and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he remains an outspoken critic of US intelligence practices and what he sees as their integral role in aggravating rather than ameliorating the world's greatest threats and challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, I had the good fortune of being able to touch base with Steele to dig deeper into his recent analysis of the future of US politics in the context of our accelerating environmental challenges. The first thing I asked him was where he sees things going over the next decade, given his holistic take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Properly educated people always appreciate holistic approaches to any challenge. This means that they understand both cause and effect, and intertwined complexities,&quot; he said. &quot;A major part of our problem in the public policy arena is the decline in intelligence with integrity among key politicians and staff at the same time that think tanks and universities and non-governmental organisations have also suffered a similar intellectual diminishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My early graduate education was in the 1970's when Limits to Growth and World Federalism were the rage. Both sought to achieve an over-view of systemic challenges, but both also suffered from the myth of top-down hubris. What was clear in the 1970s, that has been obscured by political and financial treason in the past half-century, is that everything is connected - what we do in the way of paving over wetlands, or in poisoning ground water 'inadvertently' because of our reliance on pesticides and fertilisers that are not subject to the integrity of the 'Precautionary Principle,' ultimately leads to climate catastrophes that are acts of man, not acts of god.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points me to histremendous collection of reviews of books on climate change, disease, environmental degradation, peak oil, and water scarcity. &quot;I see five major overlapping threats on the immediate horizon,&quot; he continues. &quot;They are all related: the collapse of complex societies, the acceleration of the Earth's demise with changes that used to take 10,000 years now taking three or less, predatory or shock capitalism and financial crime out of the City of London and Wall Street, and political corruption at scale, to include the west supporting 42 of 44 dictators. We are close to multiple mass catastrophes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the claim that the US is on the brink of revolution? &quot;Revolution is overthrow - the complete reversal of the status quo ante. We are at the end of centuries of what Lionel Tiger calls 'The Manufacture of Evil,' in which merchant banks led by the City of London have conspired with captive governments to concentrate wealth and commoditise everything including humans. What revolution means in practical terms is that balance has been lost and the status quo ante is unsustainable. There are two 'stops' on greed to the nth degree: the first is the carrying capacity of Earth, and the second is human sensibility. We are now at a point where both stops are activating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just the US, he adds. &quot;The preconditions of revolution exist in the UK, and most western countries. The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and on and on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why isn't it happening yet?&quot;Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. We are waiting for our Tunisian fruit seller. The public will endure great repression, especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the repressive meme of 'you are helpless, this is the order of things.' When we have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav Havel calls this 'The Power of the Powerless.' One spark, one massive fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we need more than revolution, in the sense of overthrow, to effect change, surely. How does your manifesto for 'open source everything' fit into this? &quot;The west has pursued an industrialisation path that allows for the privatisation of wealth from the commons, along with the criminalisation of commons rights of the public, as well as the externalisation of all true costs. Never mind that fracking produces earthquakes and poisons aquifers - corrupt politicians at local, state or province, and national levels are all too happy to take money for looking the other way. Our entire commercial, diplomatic, and informational systems are now cancerous. When trade treaties have secret sections - or are entirely secret - one can be certain the public is being screwed and the secrecy is an attempt to avoid accountability. Secrecy enables corruption. So also does an inattentive public enable corruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this a crisis of capitalism, then? Does capitalism need to end for us to resolve these problems? And if so, how? &quot;Predatory capitalism is based on the privatisation of profit and the externalisation of cost. It is an extension of the fencing of the commons, of enclosures, along with the criminalisation of prior common customs and rights. What we need is a system that fully accounts for all costs. Whether we call that capitalism or not is irrelevant to me. But doing so would fundamentally transform the dynamic of present day capitalism, by making capital open source. For example, and as calculated by my colleague JZ Liszkiewicz, a white cotton T-shirt contains roughly 570 gallons of water, 11 to 29 gallons of fuel, and a number of toxins and emissions including pesticides, diesel exhaust, and heavy metals and other volatile compounds - it also generally includes child labor. Accounting for those costs and their real social, human and environmental impacts has totally different implications for how we should organise production and consumption than current predatory capitalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what exactly do you mean by open source everything? &quot;We have over 5 billion human brains that are the one infinite resource available to us going forward. Crowd-sourcing and cognitive surplus are two terms of art for the changing power dynamic between those at the top that are ignorant and corrupt, and those across the bottom that are attentive and ethical. The open source ecology is made up of a wide range of opens - open farm technology, open source software, open hardware, open networks, open money, open small business technology, open patents - to name just a few. The key point is that they must all develop together, otherwise the existing system will isolate them into ineffectiveness. Open data is largely worthless unless you have open hardware and open software. Open government demands open cloud and open spectrum, or money will dominate feeds and speeds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1st May, Steele sent an open letter to US vice president Joe Biden requesting him to consider establishing an Open Source Agency that would transform the operation of the intelligence community, dramatically reduce costs, increasing oversight and accountability, while increasing access to the best possible information to support holistic policy-making. To date, he has received no response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not particularly surprised. Open source everything pretty much undermines everything the national security state stands for. Why bother even asking vice president Biden to consider it? &quot;The national security state is rooted in secrecy as a means of avoiding accountability. My first book, On Intelligence: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World - which by the way had a foreword from Senator David Boren, the immediate past chairman of the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence - made it quite clear that the national security state is an expensive, ineffective monstrosity that is simply not fit for purpose. In that sense, the national security state is it's own worst enemy - it's bound to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his standing as an intelligence expert, Steele's criticisms of US intelligence excesses are beyond scathing - they are damning. &quot;Most of what is produced through secret methods is not actually intelligence at all. It is simply secret information that is, most of the time, rather generic and therefore not actually very useful for making critical decisions at a government level. The National Security Agency (NSA) has not prevented any terrorist incidents. CIA cannot even get the population of Syria correct and provides no intelligence - decision-support - to most cabinet secretaries, assistant secretaries, and department heads. Indeed General Tony Zinni, when he was commander in chief of the US Central Command as it was at war, is on record as saying that he received, 'at best,' a meagre 4% of what he needed to know from secret sources and methods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So does open source mean you are calling for abolition of intelligence agencies as we know them, I ask. &quot;I'm a former spy and I believe we still need spies and secrecy, but we need to redirect the vast majority of the funds now spent on secrecy toward savings and narrowly focused endeavors at home. For instance, utterly ruthless counterintelligence against corruption, or horrendous evils like paedophilia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Believe it or not, 95% of what we need for ethical evidence-based decision support cannot be obtained through the secret methods of standard intelligence practices. But it can be obtained quite openly and cheaply from academics, civil society, commerce, governments, law enforcement organisations, the media, all militaries, and non-governmental organisations. An Open Source Agency, as I've proposed it, would not just meet 95% of our intelligence requirements, it would do the same at all levels of government and carry over by enriching education, commerce, and research - it would create what I called in 1995 a 'Smart Nation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole point of Open Source Everything is to restore public agency. Open Source is the only form of information and information technology that is affordable to the majority, interoperable across all boundaries, and rapidly scalable from local to global without the curse of overhead that proprietary corporations impose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear to me that when Steele talks about intelligence as 'decision-support,' he really does intend that we grasp &quot;all information in all languages all the time&quot; - that we do multidisciplinary research spanning centuries into the past as well as into the future. His most intriguing premise is that the 1% are simply not as powerful as they, and we, assume them to be. &quot;The collective buying power of the five billion poor is four times that of the one billion rich according to the late Harvard business thinker Prof C. K. Prahalad - open source everything is about the five billion poor coming together to reclaim their collective wealth and mobilise it to transform their lives. There is zero chance of the revolution being put down. Public agency is emergent, and the ability of the public to literally put any bank or corporation out of business overnight is looming. To paraphrase Abe Lincoln, you cannot screw all of the people all of the time. We're there. All we lack is a major precipitant - our Tunisian fruit seller. When it happens the revolution will be deep and lasting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arab spring analogy has its negatives. So far, there really isn't much to root for. I want to know what's to stop this revolution from turning into a violent, destructive mess. Steele is characteristically optimistic. &quot;I have struggled with this question. What I see happening is an end to national dictat and the emergence of bottom-up clarity, diversity, integrity, and sustainability. Individual towns across the USA are now nullifying federal and state regulations - for example gag laws on animal cruelty, blanket permissions for fracking. Those such as my colleague Parag Khanna that speak to a new era of city-states are correct in my view. Top down power has failed in a most spectacular manner, and bottom-up consensus power is emergent. 'Not in my neighborhood' is beginning to trump 'Because I say so.' The one unlimited resource we have on the planet is the human brain - the current strategy of 1% capitalism is failing because it is killing the Golden Goose at multiple levels. Unfortunately, the gap between those with money and power and those who actually know what they are talking about has grown catastrophic. The rich are surrounded by sycophants and pretenders whose continued employment demands that they not question the premises. As Larry Summers lectured Elizabeth Warren, 'insiders do not criticise insiders.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how can activists actually start moving toward the open source vision now? &quot;For starters, there are eight 'tribes' that among them can bring together all relevant information: academia, civil society including labor unions and religions, commerce especially small business, government especially local, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government/non-profit. At every level from local to global, across every mission area, we need to create stewardship councils integrating personalities and information from all eight tribes. We don't need to wait around for someone else to get started. All of us who recognise the vitality of this possibility can begin creating these new grassroots structures from the bottom-up, right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does open source everything have the potential to 're-engineer the Earth'? For me, this is the most important question, and Steele's answer is inspiring. &quot;Open Source Everything overturns top-down 'because I say so at the point of a gun' power. Open Source Everything makes truth rather than violence the currency of power. Open Source Everything demands that true cost economics and the indigenous concept of 'seventh generation thinking' - how will this affect society 200 years ahead - become central. Most of our problems today can be traced to the ascendance of unilateral militarism, virtual colonialism, and predatory capitalism, all based on force and lies and encroachment on the commons. The national security state works for the City of London and Wall Street - both are about to be toppled by a combination of Eastern alternative banking and alternative international development capabilities, and individuals who recognise that they have the power to pull their money out of the banks and not buy the consumer goods that subsidise corruption and the concentration of wealth. The opportunity to take back the commons for the benefit of humanity as a whole is open - here and now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Steele, the open source revolution is inevitable, simply because the demise of the system presided over by the 1% cannot be stopped - and because the alternatives to reclaiming the commons are too dismal to contemplate. We have no choice but to step up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My motto, a play on the CIA motto that is disgraced every day, is 'the truth at any cost lowers all other costs'&quot;, he tells me. &quot;Others wiser than I have pointed out that nature bats last. We are at the end of an era in which lies can be used to steal from the public and the commons. We are at the beginning of an era in which truth in public service can restore us all to a state of grace.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China was yesterday given the chance to take a decisive stake in the next stage of Britain's energy and transport infrastructure as Chinese companies won the right to own and operate a nuclear power station and to help build high-speed rail lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreements were among trade deals worth &pound;14bn agreed during the visit of Chinese premier Li Keqiang, which prompted David Cameron to declare Britain is playing a part in the rise of China - which he called a defining event of the 21st century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two most controversial aspects of the deals will allow Chinese firms to own and operate a Chinese-designed nuclear station and to build and operate rail lines. The Chinese have a mixed safety record on high-speed rail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister said: &quot;Ours is truly a partnership for growth, reform and innovation. Our partnership goes well beyond the economic field. The UK recognises that the rise of China is one of the defining events of our century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We welcome the fact that China's economic growth is lifting millions out of poverty. As premier Li noted yesterday, as China grows in economic power that brings greater responsibilities on the world stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government moved to stem criticism of co-operation in the highly sensitive area of civil nuclear power by saying it is part of an overall agreement to tackle climate&nbsp;change. China and Britain also signed a joint statement on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Guardian article, the energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary Ed Davey writes: &quot;Given the boost to low carbon electricity, to energy security and to jobs, the Chinese interest in taking forward investment at Hinkley Point C - the UK's first nuclear station in a generation - is hugely welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But equally important is that both China and the UK recognise that climate&nbsp;change is one of the greatest global challenges we face, and for the first time ever, the UK and China have released a joint statement, committing our governments to work even more closely together on a response to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important because it is only the second time China has done this. The only other country with which China has agreed a statement on climate&nbsp;change is the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint statement about high-speed rail, the two governments said: &quot;Both sides agree to promote substantive cooperation between the UK-China on rail, including high-speed rail in areas including design, engineering, construction, supply operation and maintenance on projects in China and the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also major deals in energy. An &pound;11.8bn BP gas supply contract was one of a series of deals unveiled by major UK firms during Li's visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal will provide state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) with liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 20 years. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell extended an agreement with CNOOC to work on energy projects around the world, including LNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the partnership with CNOOC has been fruitful so far and the firms were &quot;committed to growing the business together&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, engineering company Rolls-Royce signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese nuclear reactor manufacturer SNPTC to cooperate on civil nuclear power projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK-based firm currently supplies emergency diesel generators to almost 40% of all nuclear reactors in China and 70% of the safety-critical equipment. Rolls-Royce employs 55,000 staff in 45 countries, including almost 2,000 in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London Stock Exchange also signed agreements with the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to strengthen the Chinese renminbi offshore market in the UK and to provide access to cash for Chinese companies. LSE chairman Chris Gibson Smith said: &quot;London is the world's most international financial market and a natural partner to China in its ambitious global development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a personal touch, Cameron gave Li a copy of the shooting script for the first episode of Downton Abbey signed by the show's creator. Li had expressed interest in visiting Highclere Castle where the drama is shot. Cameron also gave Li a special &pound;10 lunar gold coin - made by the Royal Mint and designed by the artist Wuon-Gean Ho - celebrating the Chinese year of the horse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generators from nuclear reactors to coal-fired power plants will feel the brunt of the weather changes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising sea levels, extremes of weather and an increase in the frequency of droughts and floods will all play havoc with the world's energy systems as climate&nbsp;change takes hold, a new report has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy companies are more often cited as part of the problem of climate&nbsp;change, generating the lion's share of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to around 40% of the total. But they will also suffer as global warming picks up pace, as generators - from nuclear reactors to coal-fired power plants - feel the brunt of the weather changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many large plants are particularly at risk from droughts, because they need water to cool their facilities, and floods, because they lack protection from sudden storms. Electricity distribution networks are also likely to be affected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vulnerability of energy systems to natural shocks was shown starkly when the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan had to be closed down following the 2011 tsunami, which prompted governments around the world to review their nuclear policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Energy Council (WEC), which compiled the study along with Cambridge University and the European Climate Foundation, urged generators to examine their vulnerability to climate&nbsp;change, saying that with suitable adaptations - such as protecting power plants from water shortages and building resilience into power networks - the worst of the problems could be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christoph Frei, secretary general of WEC, said governments must play a key role in ensuring the world's vital infrastructure is protected: &quot;Climate&nbsp;change is certain to impact the energy sector. We need robust and transparent policy frameworks to unlock the long-term investments that are urgently needed to deliver the future we want. Leadership will be required at all levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite efforts to increase energy efficiency, the amount of energy used globally is still set to rise. But the effects of this could be mitigated if companies invest in renewable and low-carbon forms of energy, such as windfarms and nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another key focus must be energy distribution networks - grids - according to the report, as new technology can be used to make grids &quot;smarter&quot;, saving energy by distributing energy from generators to users in more intelligent ways than has been the case with existing grid infrastructure technology, much of which is now decades old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come to get real about the challenges facing the energy sector,&quot; Frei said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of billions of pounds will be needed to invest around the globe in making energy systems more resilient in the coming decade, but most of this is money that must be spent anyway, just to keep the current systems going. If that investment is directed towards lower carbon fuels and greater efficiency, this could cut carbon dioxide emissions in the longer term, the study found. Switching to low-carbon energy would also reduce air pollution and bring health benefits, the authors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is little sign so far that energy companies around the world have taken up this message. Fossil fuels continue to dominate new investments in energy generation capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. Attempts to create a global price on carbon emissions, that could help to reverse this trend, have largely foundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philippe Joubert, executive chairman of WEC's global electricity initiative, and former president of Alstom Power, said large companies were taking note. &quot;Leading businesses in this sector increasingly realise that business as usual is no longer possible or acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, released at the Asian Clean Energy Forum on Wednesday in Manila, was based on the latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, which predicted that the effects of climate&nbsp;change would become vastly more apparent in the coming decades, if no, or inadequate, action was taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Divergent views on prospects for a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; Anthropocene &amp;#8212; this era of a human-dominated planet. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: Are we no wiser than bacteria smeared on agar, even as scientists identify an edge to the Petri dish? Watch on YouTube.]I alerted a batch of scholars and scientists focused on climate&nbsp;change and sustainable development to my taped talk on &quot;Paths to a 'Good' Anthropocene&quot; at the annual meeting of the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Australia's Charles Sturt University and the author of &quot;Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth About Climate&nbsp;Change,&quot; reacted bluntly. Read on for his reply to the group, which he also posted on his blog, followed by an initial reply from me. I'm going to edit a version of the video that includes my slides and will weigh in at greater length when that's ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Hamilton's critique, which doesn't deal with the core argument of my talk (the need for a shift in goals from numerical outcomes to societal qualities) and instead focuses on my use of the word &quot;good&quot; in relation to an era he clearly sees as awful:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for sending the link to your talk on &quot;Charting Paths to a 'Good' Anthropocene.&quot; Since you ask for responses let me express my view bluntly. In short, I think those who argue for the &quot;good Anthropocene&quot; are unscientific and live in a fantasy world of their own construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we listen to what Earth system scientists, including climate scientists, are telling us, the warming of the Earth due to human causes is a slowly unfolding catastrophe. We already have 2.4 degrees C. of warming locked in and, even under the most optimistic mitigation scenarios, it will be very hard to avoid 4 degrees C. by the end of this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to those best placed to make projections, a world 4 degrees C. warmer would be a very different kind of planet, one unsympathetic to most forms of life, including human life. Apart from climatic change, other manifestations of human impact in the Anthropocene, from interference in the nitrogen cycle to plastics in the oceans, only add to the grim outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advocates of the &quot;good Anthropocene&quot; do not attempt to repudiate the mass of scientific evidence; instead they choose to reframe it. As you declare so disarmingly in your talk: &quot;You can look at it and go 'Oh my God', or you can look at it and go 'Wow, what an amazing time to be alive!' I kind of choose the latter overall.&quot; You are, of course, entitled to put on any kind of glasses you choose, including rose-colored ones; but that does not change what you are looking at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it would make no difference if I took the time to document again what you and your fellow &quot;eco-pragmatists&quot; are looking at (the World Bank report is a pretty good overview). Unlike deniers who feel compelled to attack the science, advocates of the good Anthropocene just seem to glide over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You believe that &quot;with work ... we can have a successful journey this century.... We are going to do OK.&quot; Personally, when I think about those toiling, vulnerable masses who are going to suffer the worst consequences of a warming world, I find it offensive to hear a comfortable, white American say, &quot;We are going to do OK.&quot; I'm sorry if this seems harsh, but unless the I.P.C.C. has it completely wrong, much of the world's population is not included in your &quot;we.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eco-pragmatists who embrace the new geological epoch - Michael Schellenberger, Ted Nordhaus, Peter Kareiva, Erle Ellis, Emma Marris, Stewart Brand, Mark Lynas - express an unbounded faith in technology and human ingenuity, and view the natural world as ultimately conformable to human manipulation and resilient enough to bounce back from whatever humans throw at it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them the Anthropocene is not proof of humankind's shortsightedness or rapacity, let alone the product of a power structure defended vigorously by fossil energy interests. There are no planetary boundaries that limit continued growth in human population and economic advance. Humans can adapt and prosper in a hotter world because history proves our flexibility. In this view, as we enter the Anthropocene the only barrier to a grand new era for humanity is self-doubt and the &quot;pessimism&quot; of gloomy scientists. Like you, Ellis, Kareiva and the Breakthrough crowd see the new epoch as &quot;an amazing opportunity,&quot; humanity's transition to a higher level of planetary significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising that the eco-pragmatists attract support from conservatives who have doggedly resisted all measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, defended the interests of fossil fuel corporations, and in some cases worked hard to trash climate science. These are the same people now drawn to geoengineering, especially solar radiation management, as a substitute for reducing emissions. For them, resorting to geoengineering justifies and entrenches the prevailing system, which is their overriding goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the &quot;good Anthropocene&quot; is a story about the world that could have been written by the powerful interests that have got us into this mess and who are fighting so effectively to prevent us from getting out of it. In the long term this kind of thinking will prove more insidious than climate science denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, against all the evidence, the eco-pragmatists choose to say &quot;What an amazing time to be alive&quot; we can understand the choice as a kind of coping strategy. Those who cope this way acknowledge and accept the facts about global warming up to a point, but they blunt the emotional meaning of the facts. But it is a maladaptive coping strategy, one that provides a balm for feelings of anxiety, fear and helplessness, yet impedes the appropriate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many among the general public cope with global warming by &quot;de-problematising&quot; the threat using inner narratives such as &quot;Humans have solved these sorts of problems before&quot; and &quot;Technology will always provide a solution.&quot; The eco-pragmatists provide an intellectual justification for this kind of wishful thinking. Tacking &quot;good&quot; onto &quot;Anthropocene&quot; may be an effective emotional reframing, but it is without scientific foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been shown that humans can benefit from what psychologist Shelley Taylor calls &quot;benign fictions&quot;, unrealistic stories about ourselves and the world that lead us to predict what we would prefer to see, rather than what is objectively most likely to happen. Yet these healthy illusions that can spur us on against the odds can become dangerous delusions when they continue to be held despite evidence from the outside world telling us we must change course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, grasping at delusions like &quot;the good Anthropocene&quot; is a failure of courage, courage to face the facts. The power of positive thinking can't turn malignant tumors into benign growths, and it can't turn planetary overreach into endless lifestyle improvements. Declaring oneself to be an optimist is often used as a means of gaining the moral upper hand: &quot;Things may look bad but, O ye of little faith, be bold and cheerful like me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things are bad, and if we carry on as we are things will be very bad. It is the possibility of preventing bad turning into very bad that motivates many of us to work harder than ever. But pretending that bad can be turned into good with a large dose of positive thinking is, even more so than denying things are bad, a sure-fire way of ending up in a situation that is very bad indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was my initial e-mailed reply to Hamilton and the copied group (with shorthand tidied in a couple of spots):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great input. What you take as conscious &quot;framing,&quot; to me is much deeper than that (see Kahan et al'sculturalcognition.net&nbsp;work; think about&nbsp;McKibben and Monbiot's reactions to Fukushima&nbsp;as another example). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I actually think we are in line on the importance - the primacy in fact - of limiting impacts form climate-related extremes on the world's poorest. I've made that point that that needs to be disconnected from work on emissions mitigation because the drivers of that vulnerability are far faster than climate&nbsp;change itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See my piece on the 2009 Shanahan et al paper as one example: &quot;Debate Over Climate Risks - Natural or Not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On your other points, too, I think there's more commonality than you infer. I've never embraced geo-engineering (except for work on enhanced air capture of CO2 as a long-haul imperative). I've written that it's unlikely we'll ever see solar-radiation management because no one will ever agree where to se the thermostat and no country will have such a direct national interest that it will proceed unilaterally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See &quot;Who Gets to Set the Global Thermostat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's much more to say. For instance, I reject Hamilton's assertion that I'm expressing &quot;an unbounded faith in technology and human ingenuity.&quot; I've actually expressly rejected that simple techno-fixes will win the day. But I think the best starting point remains the talk, with the slides. Stay tuned. If you can't wait,  watch the barebones version here:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devastating floods of last winter could hit England again unless government funding cuts to flood defence budgets are reversed, MPs will warn the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall funding does not reflect the increased flood risk being driven by climate&nbsp;change, according to the MPs' report, while money for the maintenance of rivers and flood defences is at the &quot;bare minimum&quot;. The coalition imposed a 25% cut on flood defence spending on entering office in 2010.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs praise the government's &quot;money is no object&quot; relief efforts led by David Cameron, but say cost-cutting on defences was a false economy, leading to flooding and millions being spent on emergency action rather than investment in flood prevention. The Environment Agency (EA) estimates every &pound;1 invested in flood defences saves &pound;8 in future damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ministers must take action now to avoid a repeat of the devastation caused by the winter floods,&quot; said Anne McIntosh, Conservative MP and chair of the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee, which produced the report. &quot;It is essential we get the funding in place. We have repeatedly called on the government to increase revenue funding so that necessary dredging and watercourse maintenance can be carried out to minimise flood risk, yet funding for maintenance remains at a bare minimum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Efra report also finds that earlier dredging could have cut the duration of the Somerset Levels floods, though not the depth of the waters or the area of land submerged. The issue of dredging was highly controversial, with local people blaming the lack of river maintenance for the Somerset floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McIntosh said dredging was not an &quot;all-purpose&quot; solution. &quot;You have to be realistic about the scale of the floods: the Somerset Levels was always going to flood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers are also criticised by the MPs for policies that sacrificed farmland in favour of urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the EA, led by Lord Smith and heavily attacked during the flooding, largely escapes criticism from the MPs. &quot;The EA does what its political masters tell it to,&quot; said McIntosh. The Efra committee has welcomed EA moves to ease the rules governing how landowners fulfil their legal duties in maintaining the rivers flowing over their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 7,000 homes were flooded during the stormy winter, after extreme surges on the coasts and the wettest winter for at least 250 years. However, about 1.3m homes were protected by flood defences. The Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change, which advises the government, said at least &pound;500m more needed to be spent on flood defences, simply to keep up with rising risks caused by global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shadow environment secretary, Maria Eagle, noted the MPs' finding that emergency funding described by ministers as &quot;additional&quot; had in fact been re-allocated from other environment department budgets. &quot;David Cameron's 'money is no object' promise has predictably proved totally false. The government failed to prepare for the floods, they don't take the threat of climate&nbsp;change seriously and they don't have a coherent strategy to deal with the problem in the future,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cut on flood defence spending imposed by the coalition in 2010. MPs said the reduction was a false economy</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devastating floods of last winter could hit England again unless government funding cuts to flood defence budgets are reversed, MPs will warn the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall funding does not reflect the increased flood risk being driven by climate&nbsp;change, according to the MPs' report, while money for the maintenance of rivers and flood defences is at the &quot;bare minimum&quot;. The coalition imposed a 25% cut on flood defence spending on entering office in 2010.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs praise the government's &quot;money is no object&quot; relief efforts led by David Cameron, but say cost-cutting on defences was a false economy, leading to flooding and millions being spent on emergency action rather than investment in flood prevention. The Environment Agency (EA) estimates every &pound;1 invested in flood defences saves &pound;8 in future damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ministers must take action now to avoid a repeat of the devastation caused by the winter floods,&quot; said Anne McIntosh, Conservative MP and chair of the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee, which produced the report. &quot;It is essential we get the funding in place. We have repeatedly called on the government to increase revenue funding so that necessary dredging and watercourse maintenance can be carried out to minimise flood risk, yet funding for maintenance remains at a bare minimum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Efra report also finds that earlier dredging could have cut the duration of the Somerset Levels floods, though not the depth of the waters or the area of land submerged. The issue of dredging was highly controversial, with local people blaming the lack of river maintenance for the Somerset floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McIntosh said dredging was not an &quot;all-purpose&quot; solution. &quot;You have to be realistic about the scale of the floods: the Somerset Levels was always going to flood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers are also criticised by the MPs for policies that sacrificed farmland in favour of urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the EA, led by Lord Smith and heavily attacked during the flooding, largely escapes criticism from the MPs. &quot;The EA does what its political masters tell it to,&quot; said McIntosh. The Efra committee has welcomed EA moves to ease the rules governing how landowners fulfil their legal duties in maintaining the rivers flowing over their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 7,000 homes were flooded during the stormy winter, after extreme surges on the coasts and the wettest winter for at least 250 years. However, about 1.3m homes were protected by flood defences. The Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change, which advises the government, said at least &pound;500m more needed to be spent on flood defences, simply to keep up with rising risks caused by global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shadow environment secretary, Maria Eagle, noted the MPs' finding that emergency funding described by ministers as &quot;additional&quot; had in fact been re-allocated from other environment department budgets. &quot;David Cameron's 'money is no object' promise has predictably proved totally false. The government failed to prepare for the floods, they don't take the threat of climate&nbsp;change seriously and they don't have a coherent strategy to deal with the problem in the future,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal has reached its highest market share of global energy consumption for more than 40 years, figures reveal, despite fears that its high carbon emissions make it a prime cause of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of coal for power generation and other purposes grew by 3% in 2013 - faster than any other fossil fuel - while its share of the market breached 30% for the first time since 1970, the BP Statistical Review reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures were published as Prof Nick Stern, author of the influential climate&nbsp;change report the Stern Review, said his latest research indicated the economic risks of unchecked climate&nbsp;change were bigger than previously estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe is among the regions using more coal, increasing imports from the US, where coal has been displaced by even cheaper shale gas. But countries such as China and India are also huge coal users, although BP pointed out that energy growth overall in China dropped to 4.7% last year from 8.4% in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christof Ruhl, BP's chief economist and author of its statistical review, said this &quot;dramatic slowdown&quot; put a question mark over China's official economic growth figure for 2013 of 7.7%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not easy to reconcile the slowdown in energy growth numbers and official (gross domestic product) numbers . . . you can draw your own conclusions from that,&quot;Ruhl said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BP statistics show that the use of windfarms for generating electricity rose by 21% last year while solar power grew even more rapidly, by 33%, but from a lower base point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil remained the world's leading fuel, with 33% of global energy consumption. But it lost market share for the 14th consecutive year and 33% is the lowest share since BP started to compile its data in 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper from Stern, to be published in the Economic Journal, warns that living standards could start to decline later this century unless the growth in annual emissions of greenhouse gases is checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stern has updated previous models for assessing the economic impact of global warming. He said: &quot;I hope our paper will prompt other economists to strive for much better models which will help policymakers and the public to recognise the immensity the potential risks of unmanaged climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Models that assume that catastrophic damages are not possible fail to take account of the magnitude of the issues and the implications of the science.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An environmental campaigner is killed every week in Brazil. Jonathan Watts and Karina Vieira travel to L&aacute;brea in the heart of the Amazon to meet the people risking their lives</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one could accuse Nilcilene Miguel de Lima of being easily afraid. When loggers beat her and burned down her home in L&aacute;brea - in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon - the environmental activist refused to give up her struggle. When they killed her dog and frightened away the armed guards who had been sent to protect her, she carried on without them. But after they murdered her fellow campaigners and warned her she would be next, the mother of four finally fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, she is in hiding hundreds of miles from home, looking out of the bars on the window of a temporary refuge in Manaus and wondering what happened to Brazilian justice and the world's interest in protecting the planet's greatest rainforest. &quot;I'll be hiding for the rest of my life. The people who killed my friends and destroyed nature should be the ones in prison, but I'm the one who has no liberty,&quot; she says. &quot;All I ever did was protect the families who tried to conserve the environment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is an increasingly dangerous ambition in Brazil where, according to a recent report by Global Witness, more environmental and land-rights campaigners have been killed than the rest of the world put together. The study found that, on average, one activist has been killed in the country every week since 2002. If that trend continues, four will die during the course of this World Cup, though very few cases are likely to make headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the murders occur in remote regions of the Amazon - places like de Lima's home of L&aacute;brea in Amazonas state, where loggers, ranchers and land-grabbers are seizing property from smallholders, subsistence communities and indigenous tribes. Guns and muscle make the rules. Police are usually either absent, complicit or too weak to deal with the gangs of armed grileiros. The ethical consequences are immense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located in an arc of deforestation that stretches from Mato Grosso, through Acre and Rond&ocirc;nia across the Bolivian border, L&aacute;brea is among the most remote, dangerous and important frontlines of environmental protection on the planet. Whether fighting climate change or conserving biodiversity, there are few more pressing struggles in the world than the one taking place here. Yet it rarely gets much attention in Brazil, let alone the rest of the world. The stage is too distant, the drama plays out too slowly and the economic interests are weighed against the activists, who are often accused by their enemies of holding back development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting to the flash points is a challenge. Most occur deep in the forest. The terminal at the nearest local airport is little more than a shed and it receives only seven scheduled flights a week. The road network is even less developed. L&aacute;brea is at the end of the Trans-Amazonian Highway - a 4,000km road that was supposed to stretch from the east coast all the way to Peru, before the project ran out of funds and became mired in the mosquito and disease-infested swamps around the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the town at the end of this line, L&aacute;brea is a&nbsp;surprisingly bustling, sometimes surreal place with a population of more than 40,000 people - an indication of just how much human pressure is growing in the Amazon. A&nbsp;20m statue of Mary with a neon halo dominates the central plaza along with dozens of brightly coloured - and almost completely unused - recycling bins placed every 10 metres along the path. A short walk down to the Purus river is a slum of boat-dwellers living on fetid waters; vultures perch on their corrugated tin roofs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From here it is still three days' journey by motorboat to de Lima's home in south L&aacute;brea. She is president of Deus Prover&agrave;, an association of Brazilian nut farmers and rubber tappers in the community of Gede&atilde;o in the south of L&aacute;brea. Located several days canoe ride from the town, the area is dominated by a gang of gunmen who work for loggers and farmers. It is a hotspot for murder and intimidation. According to the Comiss&atilde;o Pastoral da Terra (Brazilian Pastoral Land Commission), six community leaders were assassinated in the L&aacute;brea area between 2008 and 2013 and 51 local activists continue to receive death threats. Precedent suggests one in 10 of them will be murdered in the coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Lima is tougher than most. Struggle and tragedy have defined her life. She grew up in Xapuri in Acre, the headquarters of Brazil's most celebrated campaigner Chico Mendes,who was murdered in 1988 after he tried to halt loggers and establish extractive reserves for small farmers. These were areas where the right to harvest natural resources were granted to subsistence farmers, fishermen, rubber-tappers or nut harvesters, normally as buffers against the big farms and ranches that are responsible for the worst deforestation. De Lima's father was a co-founder of the Union of Rubber Tappers alongside Marina Silva, who later became the country's most effective environment minister. Her husband was killed, de Lima says, on the orders of loggers and half a dozen fellow community leaders have been shot, stabbed or beaten to death in arguments over land and conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most recent victims were Adelino Ramos, who was gunned down during a&nbsp;trip to Porto Velho after he exposed illegal loggers; Raimundo Nonato Chalub, who was killed on his farm after he denounced illegal deforestation and land seizures, and Dinhana Nink who was murdered in front of her six-year-old son after she vowed to name the gunmen threatening local smallholders. Nobody was charged in any of the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle in Gede&atilde;o is now lost. The 160 families de Lima worked with have been driven out by the loggers and farmers, who have cleared 300 hectares of land. Now the same thing is happening in the neighbouring area of Riozinho. &quot;They removed the people and now they'll remove the trees,&quot; she says. The residents are given little choice. &quot;Gunmen come in the middle of the night and force people to sign documents saying they received compensation in return for leaving their land. In reality, they get nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her, the cost of speaking out has been attacks and abuse. A&nbsp;few years ago a lumber mill owner known as &quot;Pitbul&quot; reportedly took out a 100,000 reais (&pound;27,000) contract on her head. The central government deployed nine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">for&ccedil;a na&ccedil;ional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guards to protect her, but after coming under fire they, too, were afraid to remain in Gede&atilde;o.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justice in Brazil. My house has been burned. I have been beaten. My family has been threatened. My friends have been raped and killed by loggers. Yet no one has been punished. I've begged for justice, but there is no justice in Brazil. We've all been abandoned by the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reflects a global trend, according to Global Witness. Of the 908 killings worldwide it identified, fewer than 10% of cases were taken to court and just 1% resulted in convictions. The NGO said the murder rate is rising with three times as many victims in 2012 as in 2002 - a sign, it says, of the intensifying battle for scarce resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Never has it been more important to protect the global environment and never has it been more deadly,&quot; writes Global Witness. But the campaigning NGO says the risks are rarely seen in their international context. &quot;The problem is poorly understood. Where cases are recognised or recorded, they are generally seen in isolation and not as part of larger trend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the problem is contentious. In the Global Witness report, the 448 deaths in Brazil since 2002 are more than four times more than the next most deadly country - Honduras, with 109. As the group acknowledges, this wide discrepancy is partly because Brazil has a strong civil society that can monitor and report on killings. In less open countries, countless cases go unreported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also differences in the definition of environmental activism. In Brazil, most of the victims were not trying solely to conserve a pristine forest. Instead they want to exploit the natural resources themselves - albeit on a&nbsp;more sustainable scale than the big farms. This puts them up against powerful forces. Brazil has one of the most concentrated levels of land ownership in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agricultural lobby - or Banca Ruralista - says activists and smallholders are holding back development. Its voice has become increasingly influential as cash crops have grown more important to the Brazilian economy. The group's leader, K&aacute;tia Abreu, claims her bloc is likely to be a decisive force in the upcoming presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against such influential interests, L&aacute;brea activists feel isolated. &quot;What we have here is more or less a Wild West. The government doesn't care about us. Even when there are laws, we are the ones who have to enforce them otherwise nobody respects them. We have to fight,&quot; says Wanderleide de Souza, the director of the National Council of Extractive Populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we meet, she is recovering from her third bout of malaria this year and apologises for &quot;looking yellow&quot;. For most of the past few years, however, disease has been a relatively minor concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Souza has had countless phone calls warning her that she will be raped and murdered unless she gives up her work. One state deputy came to her home to intimidate her and called her a whore. &quot;He thought that I would be the weakest link because I'm a&nbsp;woman, but the opposite is true. We have to be extra tough,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her determination and optimism are shared by others in northern L&aacute;brea, where small-scale farmers and fisherman have benefited from the creation in 2008 of extractive reserves along the Purus and Ituxi rivers. These were established as buffers against the large-scale logging and farming operations that have destroyed swathes of the Amazon. But it puts the residents up against business interests and local politicians who are doing everything in their power to undermine the reserves and frighten off the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ant&ocirc;nio Vasconcelos, a pastor and environmentalist, was a key figure in the creation of the reserves and has long been a target of opponents led by the former mayor of L&aacute;brea, Gean Campos Barros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm terrified. I feel my life is in danger. I&nbsp;feel completely insecure,&quot; he says. &quot;Whenever I&nbsp;hear someone approaching, I fear it could be someone coming for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several years ago, his name was found on a&nbsp;hit-list of community activists. When two of the others on the list - Z&eacute; Cl&aacute;udio and Adelino Ramos - were murdered, the government provided round-the-clock protection. For three years, Vasconcelos lived with 13 police officers. &quot;It didn't stop the threats,&quot; he says. &quot;Every night someone would call to say they had a bullet not only for me, but for each of my guards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such fears have not stopped him campaigning against illegal loggers, farmers and plans for hydroelectric dams. Vasconcelos says he was inspired by Chico Mendes. &quot;He told us we must fight for what we believe and not be intimidated. He created many Chico Mendes in L&aacute;brea and elsewhere,&quot; he says. &quot;I consider myself the second Chico Mendes. I am doing all I&nbsp;can to protect the environment in the Amazon, but sometimes I wonder if it is worthwhile because the government doesn't protect us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are similar stories of intimidation, threats and resistance from other activists in L&aacute;brea. Francisco Monteiro Duarte, the president of Apadrit, which covers the 776,000 hectare Ituxi reserve, is recovering from a beating by his brother - carried out, he says, on the orders of local businessmen. Concerned that the next attack could be deadly, his family have begged him to quit. He understands why. &quot;I'm in fear of my life because so many people like me have been killed. I've lost count of the number who have died since Chico Mendes,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duarte's greatest fear is an ambush during the four-hour canoe journey through the dark swamps and narrow channels from L&aacute;brea to his home in the reserve. We navigate similar waters on the way to a conservation workshop with Jos&eacute; Maria Ferreira, one of a&nbsp;new generation of activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young and charismatic, Ferreira is the first person from an extractive community to head a regional office of the government's main conservation body, the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva&ccedil;&atilde;o da Biodiversidade. He has helped the small river communities in the Ituxi reserve to profit from environmental protection. Five hundred people in the community now receive a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">bolsa verde</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (green stipend) and money goes into the area for conserving pirarucu - the largest freshwater fish in South America - that is starting to recover thanks to a new management system. But this means confronting illegal fisherman, something Ferreira urges the local community to do during a talk at a school which sits on stilts above the muddy river bank. Several residents complain the rewards are too small and the dangers too great. Ferreira knows the risks all too well. His institute was temporarily ejected from L&aacute;brea in 2010 after the former mayor stirred up a mob against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in the crosshairs. The politicians in L&aacute;brea want to get rid of me because I'm stopping them from making money,&quot; he tells the participants. &quot;I feel very threatened but it doesn't weaken me and the fight for conservation. Threats are part of the job. Once, my wife was beaten up and the attackers told her, 'Next time, we kill your husband.' Last year they broke into my home, held a knife against the neck of my one-year-old child and ordered my wife to tell them where I was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local woman implores him to be careful. &quot;Yesterday someone stopped me and told me to tell you that you are going to lose your head,&quot; she says. &quot;God bless you for the work that you do. I should take a picture of you so I&nbsp;can remember what you look like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After we return to the river and navigate away from the community, Ferreira says he will not be scared off. &quot;I have always loved what I am doing and now we are getting some good results so I&nbsp;feel we are really going in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His story - like that of so many other activists that we met - is simultaneously uplifting, depressing and worrying. The residents of the extractive reserves receive some support from some sectors of the government - the Human Rights Secretary and the Environment Ministry - but the powerful agribusiness lobby is increasingly influential. The rights of extractive populations seem a low priority for the president, Dilma Rousseff, conservation even less so. Damningly, after almost a decade of slowing deforestation, land clearance spiked back up by 28% last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That should make anyone concerned about ethics think twice before buying soy, beef, nuts, furniture, timber or other products from Brazil unless they are certified as being from a supplier that works with extractive communities or sustainable farms. It should also encourage more support for the campaign for a UN Human Rights Council resolution to address the heightened threat posed to environmental and land defenders around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists such as de Lima, Ferreira, Duarte, Vasconcelos and de Souza face very serious dangers. But despite the killings and threats, Brazil's extractive communities are alive and kicking. The least they deserve is the outside world's support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANAHEIM, Calif. -- President Obama, appearing emboldened after his recent move to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, on Saturday ridiculed members of Congress who deny climate&nbsp;change or plead scientific ignorance as an alibi for avoiding an uncomfortable truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in gleefully sarcastic terms to a commencement ceremony at the University of California, Irvine, Mr. Obama likened those who deny climate&nbsp;change to people who would have told John F. Kennedy, at the dawn of the space program, that the moon ''was made of cheese.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He saved his most scathing words for lawmakers who say they are not qualified to judge the issue because they are not scientists. These people, the president said, recognize the truth but will not utter it for fear of being ''run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not a scientist either,'' Mr. Obama told this young audience, ''but we've got some good ones at NASA. I do know the overwhelming majority of scientists who work on climate&nbsp;change, including some who once disputed the data, have put the debate to rest.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also said he had hit upon a novel way to speed up and improve the nation's response to hurricanes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, wildfires, mudslides and other natural disasters: Make states and cities compete for grants from a $1 billion fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama announced the competition, saying it would award funds to state and local authorities with the most innovative plans for rebuilding in a way that protects against future disasters. The money would come from existing federal recovery funds, with $180 million of the total reserved for states devastated by Hurricane Sandy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We also have to realize, as hundreds of scientists declared last month, that climate&nbsp;change is no longer a distant threat, but 'has moved firmly into the present,' '' the president said. ''In some parts of the country, weather-related disasters like droughts, fires, storms and floods are going to get harsher, and they're going to get costlier.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's remarks came during a four-day visit to the West Coast that has been shadowed by the crisis in Iraq. The White House said the president spoke by phone with his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, on Friday evening and Saturday morning. Ms. Rice and other aides were meeting in Washington to develop military options for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determined not to let the crisis paralyze his trip, Mr. Obama kept the focus firmly on climate&nbsp;change Saturday. This month he announced regulations that would cut carbon-dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama can push through this measure without legislation, though lawmakers might try to block it. So in speeches to friendly crowds like this one, he has reveled in portraying his Republican opponents as a sort of flat-Earth society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Today's Congress,'' he declared, ''is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence. They will tell you climate&nbsp;change is a hoax or a fad. One member of Congress actually says the world might be cooling.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lest his message veer too much into partisan sniping, Mr. Obama added, ''I want to tell you this to light a fire under you. As the generation getting shortchanged by inaction on this issue, I want to tell you that you cannot accept that this is the way it has to be.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony was held under bright sunshine before a crowd of about 30,000 at Angel Stadium, and came 50 years after President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke at the dedication of this campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Mr. Obama attended a Democratic Party fund-raiser in Laguna Beach. He spoke to 25 donors at a home on a manicured hillside overlooking the Pacific that belongs to Anne Earhart, an environmental activist who is a granddaughter of the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters were kept out of the meeting, which a Democratic Party spokeswoman described as a round-table discussion, with each guest contributing up to $32,400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama squeezed these events into what is otherwise a getaway with his wife, Michelle, and daughter Malia in Rancho Mirage. The president has become enamored of the desert oasis there since he began holding meetings at Sunnylands, the estate built by Walter H. Annenberg. On Saturday, with the temperature 102 degrees, he played golf on the Sunnylands course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, with no foreign leaders to meet, the Obamas are staying at a vacation house that belongs to Michael S. Smith, an interior designer known for remodeling the Oval Office. Mr. Smith's partner, James Costos, an HBO executive, was appointed by Mr. Obama as ambassador to Spain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nutshell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grower, writer, photographer and River Cottage collaborator Mark Diacono fills the pages of his sixth book with the story of Otter Farm in Devon, Britain's &quot;first and only climate-change farm&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it cover?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year on Diacono's smallholding. We learn how to grow &quot;the best of the familiar, 'forgotten' food. . . and climate-change food&quot; and the recipes highlight the farm's seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it good?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diacono shares his considerable knowledge, making the book encyclopaedic and accessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's it for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who share Diacono's enthusiasm for the forgotten or unfamiliar, such as borage, mulberries and sorbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's it not for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who prefer their cooks seen but not heard. This cookbook is peppered with personal stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best recipe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spring-summer chapter has us craving gooseberry salsa and lamb with lavender and lemon thyme, while ahead lie plates of beetroot and labneh with tipples of mulberry vodka and blackberry whisky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything else?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otter Farm's unconventional produce means that many of the recipes require hard-to-find ingredients. They are easily adapted, but it leaves us longing for access to a bountiful and offbeat allotment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We say</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diacono paints a wonderful picture of farm life, though his theory of a climate-change farm doesn't get much exploration in the book.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plastic waste is becoming one of the most damaging pollutants spreading in the world's oceans, posing a tremendous danger to marine life and human health. This nonbiodegradable material is also threatening people who depend on the fishing industry to survive. I have seen this problem in my own country, Spain, where fishermen often catch more plastic trash in their nets than fish.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we go on polluting the oceans with plastic the problem will escalate out of control. We are in urgent need of a solution, and it can only be found through the common seat of authority over all nations: the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global agreement signed by governments to prevent plastic from polluting the oceans is the only way to avoid the eventual collapse of our marine ecosystems and to make our planet a better and safer place for all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politics of climate&nbsp;change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''The climate domino'' by Paul Krugman (Review, June 7). Mr. Krugman is contemptuous of anyone who does not support President Obama's climate&nbsp;change policies. The basic assumption of this policy is that global warming is significant, that people are responsible, and that it can be stopped at reasonable cost. Reasonable people can disagree on this, so there is no reason to insult them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an economist Mr. Krugman should know that a model is only as good as its predictions. The major prediction made in the first report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change in 1990 that global temperatures would increase significantly during the next 25 years has been rejected by the subsequent data. The most recent I.P.C.C. report admits this. Considering this fact, it seems that the appropriate response would be to halt all policy initiatives until we get more data.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's chief scientist has called for researchers to speak out about the risks and benefits of strategies for tackling climate&nbsp;change before national policies are set by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mark Walport, the government's top science adviser, said the climate&nbsp;change debate had to move on from arguments over the reality of global warming to more pressing questions of what the country should do in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Guardian, Walport urged scientists and engineers to be vocal about the pros and cons of new energy sources and technologies designed to combat climate&nbsp;change to ensure that policy decisions came from a public debate based on solid evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change is happening and humans are significant contributors, and that raises some really important policy questions,&quot; Walport said. &quot;Scientists should be setting out the options and explaining what happens in each case. The debate has to move on to what are we going to do about climate&nbsp;change, and how are we going to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention comes after a speaking tour of Britain during which Walport said audiences wanted to hear more on how science could be used to forge good policies. He said that while policy decisions could be taken only by society as a whole, researchers must be more vociferous about the risks and uncertainties of different technologies and strategies proposed to curb climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can only have a good conversation about this if we have good communication from the scientists. More scientists need to do it and they need to do it well. They must talk, write and communicate about the science, technology and engineering,&quot; Walport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift in focus would bring an endless range of questions to the fore, and feed into decisions on the best energy mix for Britain, ways to decarbonise agriculture and transport, and options for boosting energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of energy, Walport said that evidence from scientists and engineers showed that fracking was a safe technology when done properly, and that risks of methane leaks, tremors and contamination of groundwater could all be managed. But he added that science was only one aspect of a much larger debate around fracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not up to scientists. It's a political decision and a societal decision. One thing we cannot do is turn off our power supply. Advanced societies depend on it,&quot; Walport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN talks that aim to reach a legally binding agreement on curbing global emissions continue in Bonn this week. But the difficulties in thrashing out a global deal highlight the clash of priorities that governments face. To give a clearer picture on the likely impacts of different policies, scientists and engineers need to explain what is known and what remains uncertain for the UK and abroad where disruption caused by climate&nbsp;change could have knock-on effects around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Tol, an economics professor who specialises in climate&nbsp;change and energy issues at Sussex University, agreed that the debate needed to move on. &quot;Any discussion around climate policy is mostly about climate science, or rapidly degenerates into a debate around climate science,&quot; he said. &quot;It's time the debate is shifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem, Tol said, is that climate modellers and experts in the basic science of climate&nbsp;change are often the ones invited on to public discussion panels, rather than experts in solar panels, agriculture or insulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the major issue of what is the best mix of energy sources for Britain lie other major questions around agriculture, which causes 9% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;If you are serious about cutting methane emissions, it means giving up cows' milk and giving up cow meat. What are the alternatives? Kangaroo is a good alternative, but the problem is these animals tend to jump,&quot; said Tol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benny Peiser, director of the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is against many policies to tackle global warming, welcomed Walport's call to action. &quot;It's not about the nitty-gritty details of the science. It's about finding the best way of dealing with a big issue that has a potential to cause a lot of problems in the future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Tol, an economics professor who specialises in climate&nbsp;change and energy issues at Sussex University, agreed that the debate needed to move on. &quot;Any discussion around climate policy is mostly about climate science, or rapidly degenerates into a debate around climate science,&quot; he said. &quot;It's time the debate is shifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem, Tol said, is that climate modellers and experts in the basic science of climate&nbsp;change are often the ones invited on to public discussion panels, rather than experts in solar panels, agriculture or insulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the major issue of what is the best mix of energy sources for Britain lie other major questions around agriculture, which causes 9% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;If you are serious about cutting methane emissions, it means giving up cows' milk and giving up cow meat. What are the alternatives? Kangaroo is a good alternative, but the problem is these animals tend to jump,&quot; said Tol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benny Peiser, director of the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is against many policies to tackle global warming, welcomed Walport's call to action. &quot;It's not about the nitty-gritty details of the science. It's about finding the best way of dealing with a big issue that has a potential to cause a lot of problems in the future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mark Walport wants scientists to be more vocal in discussing climate&nbsp;change policies and energy issues such as fracking</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The self-defeating logic of militarised social science targets anti-capitalist 'extremists' in the new 'age of uncertainty'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday I wrote about the Pentagon's dubious role in funding social science research that could be applied to active military operations in the context of the increasing propensity for global systemic crises to challenge US interests. Several key research projects highlighted the extent to which US security agencies, assisted by civilian academic institutions, view entire populations - particularly those involved in political activism - as potential terror suspects who, therefore, deserve to be carefully monitored and studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just the US where the effort to subordinate social science to the demands of state military ideology continues apace. In Britain, a key area where this is occurring is in the Research Councils UK (RCUK) Global Uncertainties programme, recently rebranded as the 'Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme is led by the Economics and Social Research Council (ESRC), and supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). But it is not an independent exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather it is explicitly designed to &quot;help governments, businesses and societies to better predict, detect, prevent and mitigate threats to society&quot; in the context of&quot; environmental change and diminishing natural recourses, food security, demographic change, poverty, inequality and poor governance, new and old conflicts, natural disasters and pandemics, expansion of digital technologies, economic downturn and other important global developments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RCUK partnership is thus deeply politicised. It &quot;works closely&quot; with a wide range of UK government departments, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department of Communities and Local Government, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence (MoD), Home Office, and the US Homeland Security Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its strategic advisory board is chaired by Sir Richard Mottram, a longtime Whitehall civil servant for defence whose last post was as Permanent Secretary for Intelligence, Security and Resilience in the Cabinet Office - Prime Minister Tony Blair's top national security adviser - who also recently praised the coalition government's Strategic Defence and Security Review as containing &quot;much of value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also currently chair of the board of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an MoD executive agency which performs science and technology work for defence purposes. Among Dstl's activities are high-level operational analysis to support the Ministry of Defence along with providing support to counter-terrorism and frontline operations - to name just a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's defence review which happened to meet with Sir Mottram's approval, titled 'Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty', highlights the future risks of heightening &quot;competition for resources, growing populations and climate change.&quot; Priorities include &quot;securing trade and energy supply routes&quot;; working &quot;overseas, using diplomatic, military, intelligence and economic activity to mitigate disruption to the transit of energy supplies&quot;; as well as tackling risks &quot;associated with other resources, such as key mineral components important for particular industries (e.g. rare earth metals which are crucial for some low carbon technologies), water and food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestically, the review calls for &quot;enhanced central government and Armed Forces planning, coordination and capabilities&quot; under the extraordinary totalitarian powers of the Civil Contingencies Act, to respond to domestic emergencies in the form of natural hazards, environmental disasters or other forms of strategic shocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the RCUK Global Uncertainty programme's strategic advisory board represent a veritable 'who's who' of the British defence policy establishment. They include Prof Michael Clarke, head of the Royal United Services Institute but also a 2009 appointee to the Prime Minister's National Security Forum, a 2010 appointee to the Chief of Defence Staff's Strategic Advisory Group, and a defence advisor to the UK Trade and Industry; former head of defence and security at the Government Office for Science and now deputy chief scientific advisor at the Department of Transport; Rob MacFarlane, assistant director for resilience in the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, National Security Secretariat, Cabinet Office; Prof Martyn Thomas, a member of the MoD's Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC), and a non-executive director of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA); Dr Seamus Tucker, a former career Foreign Office official who worked in Afghanistan and Pakistan supporting counter-terrorism efforts, and currently deputy director for science and technology in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) of the Home Office where his remit includes engaging with the UK security industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These individuals are responsible for the Global Uncertainty programme's &quot;strategic direction&quot; and &quot;core themes&quot;, co-ordination of its activities with the work of &quot;research funders and potential users&quot; - primarily &quot;government&quot; and &quot;businesses&quot; - and effective &quot;exploitation of the research,&quot; including &quot;how best to ensure inputs from 'connected' RCUK and stakeholder investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the research generated through this programme is undoubtedly useful, and occasionally innocuous - but ultimately its fundamental direction is constrained by the naval-gazing limitations of the establishment ideology pertaining to UK security agencies and officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no surprise then that UK social scientists are feeling the pressure. Over the years, dozens of my senior academic colleagues at various international relations departments of top universities up and down the country have told me they are increasingly concerned and demoralised by the escalating encroachment of defence-related funding on the research environment. International relations departments are being transformed, they say, into conveyor belts for establishment-friendly 'security studies', with research designed for practical policy and operational utility being favoured the most for funding. Meanwhile, the scope for the sort of independent critical and sceptical inquiry that should be the hallmark of sound scholarship is being undermined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These concerns are borne out by the facts. In 2007 the Guardian reported on an in-depth report exposing how 26 British universities had received contracts for research from the defence industry to the tune of nearly a billion pounds. &quot;Corporate interests tend to favour secrecy, a monopoly of intellectual property rights, and the silencing of dissidence,&quot; concluded thejoint study by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) and Fellowship for Reconciliation (FoR). This sort of funding has continued, and includes extensive UK government military funding - and the numbers are probably much higher as several institutions refuse to provide information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideological impetus behind this sort of research can be gleaned from a UK Ministy of Defence (MoD) report on global strategic trends published in 2010, updated in 2013, which contributed to the UK government's Defence Green Paper. This is the first part of the process leading to the 2010 Strategic Defence Review, which met with the approval of Global Uncertainty chair Sir Moratt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key theme of the report by the MoD's Development, Concept and Doctrines Centre (DCDC) is that the world &quot;is likely to face the reality of a changing climate, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, resurgence in ideology, and shifts in global power from West to East&quot; out to 2040. Dependence on complex global systems, chiefly &quot;global supply chains for resources&quot; is likely to &quot;increase the risk of systemic failures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although globalisation is &quot;likely to be an engine for accelerating economic growth&quot; the report said, it could also be &quot;a source of risk, as local markets become increasingly exposed to destabilising fluctuations in the wider global economy. Economically, globalisation is likely to generate winners and losers, especially in the labour market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Globalisation will likely benefit &quot;the globalised core, which comprises the most interdependent and economically successful regions of the world.&quot; However, the report alludes to the danger of civil unrest in the core: &quot;Instability within the globalised core is likely to adversely affect the national interests of major powers.&quot; Furthermore it is the job of the globalised core's security agencies to protect its dominant access to resources and technologies of production:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Resources, trade, capital and intellectual property are likely to flow through this core, and rely on complex networks of physical and virtual infrastructure&quot; including &quot;air and sea lanes and their associated ports, rail and road infrastructure, communications links, gas, oil, electricity pipelines and cables, food distribution centres, banking and finance hubs, universities and science parks, manufacturing and energy production facilities.&quot; Therefore: &quot;Ensuring the security of this globally distributed infrastructure is likely to be of multilateral interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that a tightly-knit network of just 147 of the world's most powerful companies own and control the bulk of the world's productive assets, this is virtually a defence manifesto for the 1% (or, perhaps more accurately, the 0.1%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the world producing sufficient energy, food and freshwater resources, the MoD report continues, &quot;distribution and access to resources will be uneven&quot; - concentrated in the richer core at the expense of the poorer periphery - &quot;and local and regional shortages will occur, increasing the likelihood of societal instability and of disagreement between states, and providing the triggers that may ignite conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most disturbing is the report's implicit securitisation of foreign Muslim-majority populations in the periphery, and diaspora communities in the &quot;core.&quot; Rising populations &quot;especially in the Middle East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa&quot; may &quot;fuel instability&quot; by generating &quot;youth bulges&quot; that could &quot;provide a reservoir of disaffected young people. In particular, young males with limited economic prospects may be susceptible to radicalisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report emphasises the vulnerability of cities, stating that &quot;large urban areas&quot; especially those with poor governance could become &quot;centres of criminality and disaffection,&quot; and as such, &quot;focal points for extremist ideologies.&quot; This could culminate in &quot;urban, rather than rural, insurgency&quot;, and at worst the failure of local governments. Here, the MoD refers directly to the rationale for the sort of social science research currently being funded in earnest by its American counterpart:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A greater understanding of the dynamics of urban societies will be required if instability within these regions is to be identified and managed. New ideologies will emerge, driven by religion, ethnic differences, nationalism, inequality or a combination of these factors. Ideological conflicts are likely to occur and extremist groups </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">may</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use violence to achieve political objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note here that the sweeping reference to &quot;extremist groups&quot; indicates that violence is not integral to the assumption of their extremist character; what, then, makes them &quot;extremist&quot;? The MoD report is conveniently vague on this point, but it seems the context suggests any group working for major political and economic change that challenges the dominance of the &quot;globalised core&quot; - very similar themes to research funded by the DoD:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There may be a resurgence of anti-capitalist ideologies, such as Marxism. Diaspora communities are likely to increase in size and influence and many will bring economic benefits to their host states. However, those that fail to integrate are likely to remain reservoirs for resentment. Some of these groups are likely to become involved in ideologically driven conflicts, and may act as proxies for other states. Similarly, host states may be drawn into regions and conflicts that reflect the interests of their diaspora communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So ideologies which oppose global capitalism are &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;radical&quot;, and assumed to be inherently vulnerable to political violence. Meanwhile, &quot;diaspora communities&quot; in the west - a polite euphemism for black and ethnic minority groups - will be particularly vulnerable to becoming &quot;reservoirs for resentment&quot; as capitalist globalisation continues to deepen inequalities between &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot;, and thus to operating as fifth column &quot;proxies&quot; for foreign interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the language here is carefully articulated, its racist, imperialist pretensions are difficult to overlook: in coming decades, Muslims, immigrants, foreigners and activists are all potential terrorists, and must therefore be watched. The analysis is subliminally premised on the axiomatic drive to protect the multilateral supremacy of the globalised core at the expense of the periphery, rather than recognising the causal role of that very structure in accelerating security risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The underlying assumption is that the present system is the most advanced ever possible for humanity, and thus must be protected in its current structure at all cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upshot is that Anglo-American security agencies, with the best of intentions, believe that civilian populations across both the core and periphery will become vortexes for 'extremism' as the normal operation of global capitalism concentrates the benefits of growth in a powerful minority dominating the planet's productive resources, and thus ramps up resentment against the system - with the core locus of such dangerous resentment orienting around activists, civil society groups, and minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the instability of global capitalism accelerates, the 'war on terror' is increasingly transforming into a war on dissent - a war on everyone who either opposes global capitalism in its current form, or is marginalised by it. In a world where 85 people are collectively worth $1 trillion - equal to the entire wealth of the bottom half of the world's population - it's fair to say that makes most of us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Space Agency scientist says annual sea level rises since 1993 indicate that warming has continued unabated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A widely reported &quot;pause&quot; in global warming may be an artefact of scientists looking at the wrong data, says a climate scientist at the European Space Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global average sea surface temperatures rose rapidly from the 1970s but have been relatively flat for the past 15 years. This has prompted speculation from some quarters that global warming has stalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Stephen Briggs from the European Space Agency's Directorate of Earth Observation says that sea surface temperature data is the worst indicator of global climate that can be used, describing it as &quot;lousy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like looking at the last hair on the tail of a dog and trying to decide what breed it is,&quot; he said on Friday at the Royal Society in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate scientists have been arguing for some time that the lack of warming of the sea surface is due to most of the extra heat being taken up by the deep ocean. A better measure, he said, was to look at the average rise in sea levels. The oceans store the vast majority of the climate's heat energy. Increases in this stored energy translate into sea level rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sea level shows us the engine of global climate not one of the consequences,&quot; said Briggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past 50 years, sea levels indicated that the stored energy had increased by 250 zetajoules, he said. A zetajoule is 1021 joules. For comparison, mankind generates 0.5 zetajoules of energy every year in its power stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1993, satellites have measured sea levels rising by an average of 3mm per year. Unlike the surface temperature, this rise continued throughout the supposed pause in global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Merchant at the University of Reading has been working to understand why the increase in the stored energy has not translated into an increase in sea surface temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of contributions and a picture is emerging,&quot; he says. Those contributions include the cooling effect of aerosols from Asian industrialisation, natural variability in the climate system and solar variability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, climate scientists identified another potentially important contribution. The trade winds across the Pacific have strengthened in the past decade, which could be helping to drive a deep circulation of water that traps heat in the depths of the ocean, leaving the surface relatively unaffected for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists are now trying to simulate the behaviour using computer models. This is difficult because the behaviour of the deep ocean is too poorly known to be reliably included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The models don't have the skill we thought they had. That's the problem,&quot; said Peter Jan van Leeuwen, director of the National Centre of Earth Observation at the University of Reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building reliable computer models is depdendent on knowing which parameters are important to the climate, and over the past decade scientists have homed in on the key parameters of the Earth's system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They call these the Essential Climate Variables or ECVs. There are 50 of them and they include measurable quantities such as air pressure and temperature, sea ice cover, ocean colour, ozone and carbon dioxide content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem in building computer models has been knowing how to compare measurements taken by different satellites. Instruments and techniques change and each has its own quirks. So, even if two instruments have measured the same property, it can be like comparing apples with oranges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Esa Climate&nbsp;Change Initiative (CCI)is a (EURO)75m programme, active since 2009, to address this and produce a trustworthy set of ECV data that can be accessed by all. It has transformed the entire 30-year-old data archives of Esa and its member states' Earth observation satellites into a single, calibrated data set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Boumphrey, head of Earth observation at the UK Space Agency, said, &quot;CCI allows us to put trust into our climate observations. This is a paradigm shift for how we look at our planet. Even if we don't agree on the interpretation of the data, we can now all agree on what has been measured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smartphone apps for scientists and the general public will be released in the coming weeks to allow them to access this data. In addition, a workshop for app developers is taking place at Esa's Esrin centre, Italy, in September to develop new ideas and concepts for other apps that use Esa's satellite Earth observation data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The data from CCI will really help us build better models of the Earth's climate,&quot; said van Leeuwen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esa operates a fleet of Earth observation satellites. The latest, Sentinel-1, was launched on 4 April 2014 and is the first satellite in the Copernicus Earth observation programme. To foster trust and transparency in climate science, all data will be made accessible to anyone who wants it through the CCI initiative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launched in 2008 - the year of the global banking crisis - the DoD 'Minerva Research Initiative' partners with universities &quot;to improve DoD's basic understanding of the social, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape regions of the world of strategic importance to the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the projects awarded for the period 2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model &quot;of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions.&quot; The project will determine &quot;the critical mass (tipping point)&quot; of social contagians by studying their &quot;digital traces&quot; in the cases of &quot;the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter posts and conversations will be examined &quot;to identify individuals mobilised in a social contagion and when they become mobilised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another project awarded this year to the University of Washington &quot;seeks to uncover the conditions under which political movements aimed at large-scale political and economic change originate,&quot; along with their &quot;characteristics and consequences.&quot; The project, managed by the US Army Research Office, focuses on &quot;large-scale movements involving more than 1,000 participants in enduring activity,&quot; and will cover 58 countries in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the DoD's Minerva Initiative funded a project to determine 'Who Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?' which, however, conflates peaceful activists with &quot;supporters of political violence&quot; who are different from terrorists only in that they do not embark on &quot;armed militancy&quot; themselves. The project explicitly sets out to study non-violent activists:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In every context we find many individuals who share the demographic, family, cultural, and/or socioeconomic background of those who decided to engage in terrorism, and yet refrained themselves from taking up armed militancy, even though they were sympathetic to the end goals of armed groups. The field of terrorism studies has not, until recently, attempted to look at this control group. This project is not about terrorists, but about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">supporters</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of political violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project's 14 case studies each &quot;involve extensive interviews with ten or more activists and militants in parties and NGOs who, though sympathetic to radical causes, have chosen a path of non-violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I contacted the project's principal investigator, Prof Maria Rasmussen of the US Naval Postgraduate School, asking why non-violent activists working for NGOs should be equated to supporters of political violence - and which &quot;parties and NGOs&quot; were being investigated - but received no response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Minerva programme staff refused to answer a series of similar questions I put to them, including asking how &quot;radical causes&quot; promoted by peaceful NGOs constituted a potential national security threat of interest to the DoD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among my questions, I asked:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does the US Department of Defense see protest movements and social activism in different parts of the world as a threat to US national security? If so, why? Does the US Department of Defense consider political movements aiming for large scale political and economic change as a national security matter? If so, why? Activism, protest, 'political movements' and of course NGOs are a vital element of a healthy civil society and democracy - why is it that the DoD is funding research to investigate such issues?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minerva's programme director Dr Erin Fitzgerald said &quot;I appreciate your concerns and am glad that you reached out to give us the opportunity to clarify&quot; before promising a more detailed response. Instead, I received the following bland statement from the DoD's press office:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Defense takes seriously its role in the security of the United States, its citizens, and US allies and partners. While every security challenge does not cause conflict, and every conflict does not involve the US military, Minerva helps fund basic social science research that helps increase the Department of Defense's understanding of what causes instability and insecurity around the world. By better understanding these conflicts and their causes beforehand, the Department of Defense can better prepare for the dynamic future security environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, Minerva funded a University of Maryland project in collaboration with the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to gauge the risk of civil unrest due to climate change. Thethree-year $1.9 million project is developing models to anticipate what could happen to societies under a range of potential climate change scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the outset, the Minerva programme was slated to provide over $75 million over five years for social and behavioural science research. This year alone it has been allocated a total budget of $17.8 million by US Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal Minerva staff email communication referenced in a 2012 Masters dissertation reveals that the programme is geared toward producing quick results that are directly applicable to field operations. The dissertation was part of a Minerva-funded project on &quot;counter-radical Muslim discourse&quot; at Arizona State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The internal email from Prof Steve Corman, a principal investigator for the project, describes a meeting hosted by the DoD's Human Social Cultural and Behavioural Modeling (HSCB) programme in which senior Pentagon officials said their priority was &quot;to develop capabilities that are deliverable quickly&quot; in the form of &quot;models and tools that can be integrated with operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Office of Naval Research supervisor Dr Harold Hawkins had assured the university researchers at the outset that the project was merely &quot;a basic research effort, so we shouldn't be concerned about doing applied stuff&quot;, the meeting in fact showed that DoD is looking to &quot;feed results&quot; into &quot;applications,&quot; Corman said in the email. He advised his researchers to &quot;think about shaping results, reports, etc., so they [DoD] can clearly see their application for tools that can be taken to the field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many independent scholars are critical of what they see as the US government's efforts to militarise social science in the service of war. In May 2008, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) wrote to the US government noting that the Pentagon lacks &quot;the kind of infrastructure for evaluating anthropological [and other social science] research&quot; in a way that involves &quot;rigorous, balanced and objective peer review&quot;, calling for such research to be managed instead by civilian agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following month, the DoD signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the NSF to cooperate on the management of Minerva. In response, the AAA cautioned that although research proposals would now be evaluated by NSF's merit-review panels. &quot;Pentagon officials will have decision-making power in deciding who sits on the panels&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... there remain concerns within the discipline that research will only be funded when it supports the Pentagon's agenda. Other critics of the programme, including the Network of Concerned Anthropologists, have raised concerns that the programme would discourage research in other important areas and undermine the role of the university as a place for independent discussion and critique of the military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Prof David Price, a cultural anthropologist at St Martin's University in Washington DC and author of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Weaponizing Anthropology: Social Science in Service of the Militarized State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;when you looked at the individual bits of many of these projects they sort of looked like normal social science, textual analysis, historical research, and so on, but when you added these bits up they all shared themes of legibility with all the distortions of over-simplification. Minerva is farming out the piece-work of empire in ways that can allow individuals to disassociate their individual contributions from the larger project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Price has previously exposed how the Pentagon's Human Terrain Systems (HTS) programme - designed to embed social scientists in military field operations - routinely conducted training scenarios set in regions &quot;within the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a summary critique of the programme sent to HTS directors by a former employee, Price reported that the HTS training scenarios &quot;adapted COIN [counterinsurgency] for Afghanistan/Iraq&quot; to domestic situations &quot;in the USA where the local population was seen from the military perspective as threatening the established balance of power and influence, and challenging law and order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One war-game, said Price, involved environmental activists protesting pollution from a coal-fired plant near Missouri, some of whom were members of the well-known environmental NGO Sierra Club. Participants were tasked to &quot;identify those who were 'problem-solvers' and those who were 'problem-causers,' and the rest of the population whom would be the target of the information operations to move their Center of Gravity toward that set of viewpoints and values which was the 'desired end-state' of the military's strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such war-games are consistent with a raft of Pentagon planning documents which suggest that National Security Agency (NSA) mass surveillance is partially motivated to prepare for the destabilising impact of coming environmental, energy and economic shocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Petras, Bartle Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University in New York, concurs with Price's concerns. Minerva-funded social scientists tied to Pentagon counterinsurgency operations are involved in the &quot;study of emotions in stoking or quelling ideologically driven movements,&quot; he said, including how &quot;to counteract grassroots movements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minerva is a prime example of the deeply narrow-minded and self-defeating nature of military ideology. Worse still, the unwillingness of DoD officials to answer the most basic questions is symptomatic of a simple fact - in their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular global system serving the interests of a tiny minority, security agencies have no qualms about painting the rest of us as potential terrorists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must move on from the basics of whether global warming is happening to how best to respond, says UK's science adviser</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's chief scientist called for researchers to speak out about the risks and benefits of different strategies for tackling climate&nbsp;change before national policies are set. Sir Mark Walport, the government's top science adviser, said the climate&nbsp;change debate had to move on from arguments over the reality of global warming to more pressing questions of what the country should do in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Guardian, Walport urged scientists and engineers to be vocal about the pros and cons of new energy sources and technologies designed to combat climate&nbsp;change to ensure that policy decisions came from a public debate based on solid evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change is happening and humans are significant contributors, and that raises some really important policy questions,&quot; Walport said. &quot;Scientists should be setting out the options and explaining what happens in each case. The debate has to move on, to what are we going to do about climate&nbsp;change, and how are we going to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention comes after a speaking tour of Britain during which Walport said audiences wanted to hear more on how science could be used to forge good policies. He said that while policy decisions could only be taken by society as a whole, researchers must be more vocifierous about the risks and uncertainties of different technologies and strategies proposed to curb climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can only have a good conversation about this if we have good communication from the scientists. More scientists need to do it and they need to do it well. They must talk, write, and communicate about the science, technology and engineering,&quot; Walport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift in focus would bring an endless range of questions to the fore, and feed into decisions on the best energy mix for Britain, ways to decarbonise agriculture and transport, and options for boosting energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of energy, Walport said that evidence from scientists and engineers showed that fracking was a safe technology when done properly, and that risks of methane leaks, tremors and contamination of groundwater could all be managed. But he added that science was only one aspect of a much larger debate around fracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of the day, it's not up to scientists. It's a political decision and a societal decision. There's a whole rounded discussion to have of which science is a very important element, but not the only element. One thing we cannot do is turn off our power supply. Advanced societies depend on it,&quot; Walport said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN talks that aim to reach a legally binding agreement on curbing global emissions continue in Bonn this week. But the difficulties in thrashing out a global deal highlight the clash of priorities that governments face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To give a clearer picture on the likely impacts of different policies, scientists and engineers need to explain what is known and what remains uncertain for the UK and abroad where disruption caused by climate&nbsp;change could have knock-on effects around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Tol, an economics professor who specialises in climate&nbsp;change and energy issues at Sussex University, agreed that the debate needed to move on. &quot;Any discussion around climate policy is mostly about climate science, or very rapidly degenerates into a debate around climate science - is it real, is it really getting warmer, and do we understand the causes,&quot; he said. &quot;It's what we've always been talking about, so this is what we keep talking about, but it's time the debate is shifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem, Tol said, is that climate modellers and experts in the basic science of climate&nbsp;change are often the ones invited onto public discussion panels, rather than experts in solar panels, agriculture or insulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the major issue of what is the best mix of energy sources for Britain, lie other major questions around agriculture, which causes 9% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. More than a third is methane released by livestock, and the production and use of manure and slurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are serious about cutting methane emissions, it means giving up cows' milk and giving up cow meat, and that is the discussion you need to have. What are the alternatives? Kangaroo is a good alternative, but the problem is these animals tend to jump. They are very hard to fence in,&quot; said Tol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benny Peiser, director of the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is against many policies to tackle global warming, welcomed Walport's call to action. &quot;It's not about the nitty-gritty details of the science. It's about finding the best way of dealing with a big issue that has a potential to cause a lot of problems in the future, but also has the potential to cause a lot of pain or economic burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one questions the basic science of the greenhouse effect, no one questions that we are pumping this stuff into the atmopshere and that it has a warming effect. Governments have to deal with it one way or another. The key issue is what shall we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- Norway's economy is highly dependent on oil and gas production, yet the Nordic country's largest private pension fund manager, Storebrand, worries about the risks of investing in companies that extract fossil fuels. Figuring that tighter regulations on carbon emissions will emerge in the coming years in an effort to combat climate&nbsp;change, Storebrand has decided not to invest in businesses that it believes will be hurt most by those new rules: coal companies and large producers of oil from tar sands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The business case is the main driver for what we do; companies with a sound and systematic environmental performance also perform better financially,'' said Christine Meisingset, Storebrand's head of sustainability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Meisingset and Storebrand, which manages about 500 billion kronor, or about $74 billion, are among the fund managers beginning to think skeptically about fossil fuel companies -- not so much because they or their clients disapprove of their activities, but because they think the securities issued by these companies may prove poor long-term investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasoning, which has caught the attention of major oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell, is that after a period of relative inaction, world governments may be heading toward adopting tougher rules on emissions, transforming the economics of the energy business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent proposal by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to cut emissions by the electric power industry by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 was the clearest omen of a coming change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy analysts and environmentalists say the E.P.A. proposal could prove a catalyst for a wider deal on emissions, possibly at a United Nations summit meeting on climate&nbsp;change in Paris next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, analysts say, energy companies may need to rethink their approach. The Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based group that applies financial analysis to environmental issues, estimates that over the next 10 years the international oil industry may invest as much as $1.1 trillion in projects that require a price of $80 to $95 per barrel of oil to be viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy carbon taxes or other rules that significantly raised costs could turn many of those projects, particularly those in the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and the deep waters off Brazil and the United States into money-losing white elephants, the group figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In our analysis, a big chunk of projects don't make financial sense if you apply climate policy,'' said Anthony Hobley, the group's chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups like Carbon Tracker are highlighting the risk that energy companies might be stuck with what are being called ''stranded assets,'' or large amounts of resources that the industry will not be able to produce. That danger for the industry and investors would be accentuated, these analysts say, if world governments adopt tough programs designed to restrict the increase in average global temperatures to the 2 degrees Celsius widely considered necessary to head off the most devastating effects of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental research organization based in Paris, said in a study last year that in that case, as much as two-thirds of proven fossil fuel reserves might not be commercialized by 2050, unless carbon capture and storage, a technology that strips out CO2 and injects it into the ground, is widely used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment professionals say that while their clients are not panicking, they are at least beginning to think about the possible implications of tightening regulation on emissions. ''Investors don't know whether they should be invested in these stocks. They are part of everyone's portfolio,'' saidKevin Bourne, an executive at the FTSE Group, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange that provides financial indexes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With backing from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York, Mr. Morrison has produced a global index called the FTSE Developed ex Fossil Fuels Index that is designed to provide an investment benchmark for financial products that exclude companies in the fossil fuel extraction business. These stocks, which are mostly listed in the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia, have a collective market valuation of about $2.6 trillion and make up 9 percent to 12 percent of world markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the energy industry is closely watching these developments, which might hurt its stock prices or make raising capital more difficult, the reaction so far is polite dismissal. In a public letter from J. J. Traynor, head of investor relations at Shell, responding to inquiries from shareholders ''regarding the 'carbon bubble' or 'stranded assets' issue,'' the company said it believed ''that the risks from climate&nbsp;change will continue to rise up the public and political agenda.'' However, the company said that given the expected strong growth in demand for energy in the coming years, ''We do not believe any of our proven reserves will become 'stranded.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment professionals say that there hasn't been a mass exodus out of fossil fuels. The action has been mostly limited to divesting coal mining stocks, which are an easy target because they make up less than 1 percent of the global market value of fossil fuel stocks, according to FTSE. Stanford University recently said it would purge coal stocks from its endowment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue seems unlikely to fade away, especially for investors who take a long-term approach. ''Sustainability and climate&nbsp;change are inextricably linked to thinking about things in the long term,'' said Jane Goodland, a senior consultant at the pension advisory firm Towers Watson in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Goodland said that even though the major energy companies might not be in investors' cross hairs now, they should be following the debate. ''Any company not paying attention to what its stakeholders are saying and thinking is playing a risky game,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And early indications are that investors might be able to live without oil companies -- at least in their stock portfolios. FTSE said that when it recently ran a seven-year retroactive test of its index against a more conventional developed-world index, there was little difference in performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that we would be keener to pay tax if we knew exactly how it was to be spent is one of the most persuasive in modern politics. No surprise then, as the NHS faces up to what many think is the deepest crisis ever, that the question of consumerising tax is back. The idea of earmarking a portion of national insurance to pay for the NHS is a beguiling idea, but will it work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time the debate about hypothecation captured attention was back in the 1990s, when Labour was struggling to assert its economic competence. There were reports from every self-respecting thinktank about reconnecting taxation to spending. And it's never quite gone away as an idea, having been used to justify green taxes, pay for the New Deal for the young unemployed, and support the huge boost in health spending after 2002. It may make good politics, but not necessarily good economics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fuel duty escalator, an annual increase of 3% to disincentivise motoring, was actually introduced by a Tory chancellor , but in 1997, Gordon Brown extended it to tobacco, and announced both taxes would rise by at least 5% each year. And for the first time, he linked the increased revenue to mitigating the wider environmental and health impacts of driving and smoking. Not quite a hypothecated tax, more of a hybrid, but still a way of generating revenue for particular policy objectives. But within months of implementation in 1999, the fuel levy was hounded to oblivion by mass protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow the idea of an unspecified return in the form of improved transport infrastructure was no compensation for a whacking upfront increase in the price of petrol. One weakness was that it was never made clear by how much spending on transport would rise, over and above spending already planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour introduced other levies to influence behaviour that at the same time would deliver cash for specified objectives: the climate&nbsp;change levy to incentivise the use of renewables, now heading the same way as the fuel levy; landfill tax; and an aggregates levy. Some of the revenue from the aggregates levy went into the aggregates sustainability fund, which - in case you missed it - fell to the cost-cutting bonfire of 2011. More or less the fate of the Road Fund, set up in 1920 and abandoned in 1936.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate&nbsp;change levy failed because it worked too well. It made energy too expensive. But that is not its only weakness. In order to be able to claim it would be revenue-neutral - a kind of reverse hypothecation - a 0.3% cut in employers' national insurance contributions was made at the same time. But the climate&nbsp;change levy raises less than is foregone by the national insurance cut. Cross-referencing taxes is a tricky business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full-blooded hypothecation would in theory dodge some of these weaknesses. It would directly link some or all of a particular tax to, say, funding the NHS. Labour is talking about using an increase in national insurance for just that purpose. It's worked before, when a 1p increase in national insurance contributions was used to fund the huge increase in health spending - from &pound;65bn to &pound;105bn - between 2002 and 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was sleight of hand. Only a fraction goes to the health service, which is still almost entirely funded from general taxation, so it is not as transparent as it appears. And while the good thing about national insurance is that it is relatively progressive, the bad thing is that the revenue it raises depends on the number in work. Sometimes it goes down. Health spending always goes up. There's a parliamentary briefing that spells out the options with admirable clarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So hypothecation can make tax more legitimate. But it is symbolic rather than substantive. All the same, that doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heatwaves and water shortages could devastate US farmlands devoted to corn crop, report warns</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The days of &quot;king corn&quot; could be numbered as climate&nbsp;change brings higher temperatures and water shortages to America's farmland, a new report warned on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly one-third of US farmland is devoted to raising corn and the country produces about 40% of the world's corn crop. But the $1.7tn (&pound;1tn) industry - the equivalent of Australia's GDP - is under threat from water shortages, heatwaves and unpredictable rainfall caused by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Corn is an essential input to our economy, and climate&nbsp;change, water scarcity and pollution are a critical threat to that sector going forward,&quot; said Brooke Barton, director of the water programme at the Ceres green investor network and author of the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report amplifies warnings earlier this year from United Nations climate scientists and the National Climate Assessment that America's agricultural industry - and specifically its corn crop - was at risk from the high temperatures and water shortages anticipated under climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of corn, however, there are potentially trillions at stake because the industry now touches on almost every aspect of the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn production has doubled over the past 20 years and on its own was worth $65bn last year. But corn supplies a vast spread of industries. The 45 largest companies in the corn production chain together account for about $1.7tn in earnings, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 40% of the crop now goes for production of ethanol. Another 35% of the crop is grown for animal feed, but corn is used across the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is fed to the cattle that become Big Mac. It is in the ethanol that goes into the gasoline we buy,&quot; Barton said. &quot;It's in the snackfoods that we buy, even in some of the plastics in the products we buy. It is in laundry detergents. It's everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the crop carries a heavy environmental toll. Corn uses the most water for irrigation of any crop, and accounts for half of all fertiliser use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of that corn is raised in areas experiencing water shortages because of over-use and recurring droughts, such as California's Central Valley or the high plains states of Kansas and Nebraska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20% of corn production is in irrigated areas. Most of those areas, about 87%, are undergoing water shortages. Corn production is threatening dwindling groundwater reserves, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy use of fertiliser also imposes costs. Fertiliser for corn production is the single largest cause of the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10% of fertiliser used on corn ends up as run-off, polluting water supplies across the mid-west, the report said. It estimated some $420m in fertiliser was washed into the Gulf last year, depleting oxygen levels and killing off marine life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report goes on to urge farmers and food producers to work together to reduce those climate-related risks and the environmental costs of growing corn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent studies have found corn at high risk from the higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and water shortages caused by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn plants are especially sensitive to heatwaves and drought. A report in Science last month found that growers were having more trouble than initially expected in adapting to hotter and drier conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, farmers in the mid-west have taken advantage of new corn varieties that are more resistant to pests and have more water-resistant roots by planting corn plants closer together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Science study found those densely planted fields were even more vulnerable to heat and water stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said growers in the mid-west could lose as much as 15% of their yield within the next 50 years.</SPAN></P>

Union is said to be the first seminary to take up the divestment tactic in a campaign by environmentalists to combat climate change. Last month, Stanford University announced it would divest, but only from coal companies. The president of Union, Serene Jones, said, ''Climate change poses a catastrophic threat, and as stewards of God's creation we simply must act.'' The seminary had already divested from tobacco and liquor companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain can be proud of itself: it's already more than halfway to its target of a 34% cut in greenhouse gases by 2020. At the current speed, the country will have few problems reaching its ambitious target of an 80% reduction by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 2008 Climate&nbsp;Change Act is a world-leading piece of legislation&quot;, explains Andrew Raingold, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, an alliance of leaders from business and politics advocating a sustainable economy. &quot;The big challenge is putting it into practice. The follow-up pieces are what will help us get to our goal, but that's also an area where we're weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past couple of decades, CO2 emissions have come down significantly. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, PBL, which has taken a lead role in assessing countries' CO2-cutting performance, reports that between 1990 and 2012, Britain's CO2 emissions dropped from 588 to 485 mega tonnes. This helped Britain's share of global CO2 emissions drop from 3% to just 1%. According to figures from the Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change (CCC), a government-funded but independent advisory body, the waste, road transport and power sectors are performing particularly well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, they're the only sectors steadily reducing their CO2 emissions. In 2012, the latest year for which figures are available, Britain's carbon emissions actually increased by 3.5%, mainly due to the cold weather. That year, Raingold says, Britain performed well in wind generation as well as in improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings and new cars. But the pace of change overall has slowed. &quot;The cross-party consensus has fallen apart over the past few years,&quot; says Raingold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commitment to change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how are our different industrial sectors performing? With a 63% in carbon emissions between 1990 and 2012, the aviation sector is predictably a top sinner (though British Airways reports it is working towards carbon-neutral growth by 2020). Supermarket chains, by contrast, are carbon-cutting pioneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesco, the world's third-largest retailer, has promised to halve its CO2 emissions by 2020 and is steadily reducing emissions from its stores. In stores built after 2006, emissions have already been reduced by 33.4% compared to 2006. Tesco and Asda have both formed CO2-reduction partnerships with their suppliers, encouraging the suppliers to install LED lighting, heat recovery solutions and smart refrigeration systems. Asda reports having reduced its CO2 emissions by 10% since 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For supermarkets, energy use in store makes up the by part the largest part of their carbon emissions. Cutting consumption means reducing their carbon footprint but also makes business sense. With the green economy currently responsible for one third of Britain's GDP growth, there's a business case to be made for CO2 cuts. &quot;There's very strong business support of the low-carbon economy,&quot; says CCC chief executive, David Kennedy. &quot;The CBI , for example, sees it as a great business opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Britain's lack of legislation means that siginifcant cuts to CO2 will mostly come from progressive companies. &quot;The UK in a strong position thanks to our world-leading legislation, but it's at risk of slipping behind,&quot; says Raingold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon cutting councils</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Performance across a range of industries seems to be a matter of commitment. The Environment Agency's most recent ranking shows corporations such as Skanska and Motorola on top, along with local government. Manchester city council is ranked particularly highly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of our emission reductions are a cost-saving as well,&quot; says councillor Kate Chappell. &quot;We've done a solid analysis of where our emissions are coming from. The corporate buildings were the main culprit, so we're retrofitting them. The other big area, is street lighting, so we're replacing candescent lights with LED lights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street lighting accounts for 23% of the council's total emissions. By using LED lights, it calculates that it will cut 8400 tonnes of CO2. LED lights are, of course, much more expensive than regular light bulbs, but Manchester estimates that it will save &pound;3m per year once the lights are fitted. That equates to net savings of &pound;750,000 per year over a 25-year period. The council has also launched the Manchester: A Certain Future initiative to bring down the whole city's emissions. &quot;We're trying to lead by example&quot;, says Chappell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirless and Salford councils, Bradford &amp; Bingley, NHS Blood &amp; Transplant and United Business Media are among the other top performers named by the Environment Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom of the Environment Agency's list features an equally diverse cast: ING Bank, Tennants Consolidated and Kerry Holdings. &quot;Emissions have been falling since the year 2000, but last year's cold winter and cheaper coal imports led to more coal being used for electricity generation, resulting in a rise in emissions from sulphur and nitrogen oxides, and particulates&quot;, an agency spokesperson says. &quot;However, these emissions will reduce significantly in the future as the operation of coal-fired power stations is restricted by European directives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International comparisons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is nevertheless keeping up with its international competitors. Between 1990 and 2012, French emissions decreased from 393 to 374 mega tonnes while Germany's emissions dropped from 1,020 to 807 mega tonnes. &quot;Developed countries are going about carbon cuts in different ways,&quot; says Andries Hof, a carbon expert at PBL and co-author of a report on major countries' CO2 emissions. &quot;Germany is very active in promoting solar, but because it has decided to end nuclear energy it's using more coal. And since Fukushima, Japan has had trouble meeting its targets because it no longer wants to rely on nuclear. But the UK is instead focusing more on nuclear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if you include carbon emissions from imported goods, Britain's CO2 emissions have actually increased by 10% since 1993. &quot;As a result, the UK is now one of the world's largest net importers of emissions, with a carbon footprint that is around 80% larger than its production emissions, reflecting the relatively small share of manufacturing in UK GDP&quot;, a CRC report confirms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the dilemma: precisely because developing countries' economies are growing, setting CO2 reduction targets becomes harder. And developing countries' CO2 emissions are increasing at an alarming rate. In 1990 India, for example, spewed 659 mega tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air. By 2012 that figure had skyrocketed to 1,967 mega tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, developing countries account for 59%, compared to 31% in 1990. If the world is going to control its greenhouse gas emissions, shoppers have to stop buying so many toys, clothes, cars and gadgets manufactured in developing countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: The recent debate about &quot;climate change&quot; versus &quot;global warming&quot; highlights why climate communication is so difficult.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What term works better to communicate about our warming planet, &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; or &quot;global warming&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the release of a new Yale study, the question has been rekindled, with blogs as diverse as&nbsp;FiveThirtyEight and Thinkprogress looking at the study and its implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, and the various commentary about it, &nbsp;is interesting, not just because it finds that &quot;the terms&nbsp;global warming&nbsp;and&nbsp;climate&nbsp;change&nbsp;often mean different things to Americans-and activate different sets of beliefs, feelings, and behaviors, as well as different degrees of urgency about the need to respond&quot;, but because it highlights why climate communication is so difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just why is it so hard to talk about the climate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Enten's FiveThirtyEight article is a good place to start, because it underscores the problem. The article explores the use by Democratic and Republican members of congress. Enten shows that despite the Yale study showing that Democratic voters responding better to the &quot;global warming&quot; terminology, Democrats in congress prefer to say &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot;. In fact, Republicans were more likely to say &quot;global warming&quot; than Democrats, which is the opposite of what the Yale study recommends. Enten also notes that the same phenomenon is found in US television, with Democratic-leaning shows like Hardball preferring &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; and Republican leaning shows like Hannity preferring &quot;global warming&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yale study showed that not only did Americans use the term global warming themselves, but they heard it more in public discourse, suggesting that despite Democrats politicians and media figures saying &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot;&nbsp;more, it engages them less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there have been many studies, and the frustrating thing for climate communicators and campaigners is that they are often contradictory. For example, a study from 2011 showed that Republicans preferred &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; to &quot;global warming&quot; when endorsing the reality of the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another study by EcoAmerica from 2009 suggested &quot;global warming&quot; be ditched and the phrase &quot;our deteriorating atmosphere&quot; be deployed to better engage &quot;soccer moms&quot; and &quot;environmental agnostics&quot;. The awkward term never caught on, and neither has Joe Romm's preferred term&nbsp;&quot;hell or highwater&quot; or &quot;global weirding&quot; (coined by Friedman).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Australian Parliamentary Library has weighed in with a briefing paper on the topic, unhelpfully&nbsp;adding&nbsp;the UNFCCC's use of &quot;climate variability&quot; to the mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate about terminology would be an interesting side note were not the issue so important. Global warming, or climate&nbsp;change if you prefer, is the greatest threat facing humankind this century. These seemingly innocuous phrases profoundly affect how people perceive the issues, assess the seriousness and support efforts to mitigate global warming. The complication is that although terminology is important, the manner and scale of influence is difficult to measure or understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, commentators and communicators often firmly come down on one side or the other, with staunch views about what works and what doesn't. (I use the terms interchangeably in this article and more generally in my articles for The Guardian.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant contributor to this&nbsp;is the illusion of asymmetric insight, a fascinating cognitive bias that helps explain, in my view, why climate communication is so diabolically difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asymmetric insight is a phenomenon where someone believes they understand the reasons why other people do or believe things, while at the same time being skeptical that others could ever understand them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research by academics&nbsp;Pronin, Ross, Kruger and Savitsky from 2001 into this phenomenon found that not only do you&nbsp;believe you&nbsp;understand hidden states in others far better than they know in you, but when this is expanded to groups, it's even more pronounced:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results showed liberals believed they knew more about conservatives than conservatives knew about liberals. The conservatives believed they knew more about liberals than liberals knew about conservatives. Both groups thought they knew more about their opponents than their opponents knew about themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bias is commonplace and widespread, and definitely not confined to climate communication. During elections, we see this cognitive bias on display nightly by pundits and commentators who confidently explain that movements in polls can be explained because voters think one thing or another, or are responding to a recent event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you hear statements like &quot;people support Obama's climate&nbsp;change policies because...&quot; or &quot;Democrats prefer the term 'global warming' because...&quot;, you are seeing this bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People, especially commentators, believe that they see the world how it really is, whereas most other people (especially those people who disagree with them) are deluded, ignorant or self-interested. The bias of asymmetric insight means that people are less likely to see others who disagree with them in nuanced or complex ways; simple things can explain complex and multifaceted changes in opinion or actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tying into the difficulty of climate communications is the fact that typically the people doing research into this field -&nbsp;and again, the same applies to other areas -&nbsp;are heavily invested in the area. Climate communicators mostly care deeply about the dangers of run-away climate&nbsp;change. The result is that they often underestimate the extent to which most people are ambivalent or uninterested in the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because asking questions about peoples' attitudes on an issue will generally prompt a response, the disinterest and ambivalence is hidden, and so it is easy to assume that most people have a latent interest or concern about global warming, when in fact they probably don't. The ups and downs of climate polling in Australia for example appears to show an increase in the polarisation over the issue, but it is easy to over emphasise that when you're asking the question compared to large swathes of the community where the issue may rarely or never come up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yale study found that as many people &quot;use neither&quot; (35 percent) as use the term &quot;global warming&quot; (35 percent) and more than double that use &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; (15 percent). This suggests to me that as a communications challenge, regardless of the term used, the biggest barrier is disinterest, not the specific language being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of communications is done by heuristics, but even when hard numbers, in the form of polling, is brought to the equation, there is an enormous risk that judgemental shortcuts are used to interpret those numbers. Because we believe we can understand why people believe the things they do (while at the same time not believing that others could possibly understand us), it is easy to skew or ignore the results of research like the Yale study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far back as 2003, Republican pollster Frank Luntz advocated Republicans use the term &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot;, ostensibly to give the Republicans cover against the far more effective term &quot;global warming&quot;. The memo is worth reading even eleven years later, and the Yale study and many other studies over the last few years simply confirms much of what Luntz wrote then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although Luntz highlights his &quot;words that work&quot;, really what he does is build a context through which he can influence peoples' attitudes. Creating this context goes beyond the &quot;silver bullet&quot; of a single phrase by creating shared meaning. The Yale paper again underscores this, as I noted earlier: the terms &quot;global warming&quot; and &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; mean different things to different people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just changing from one phrase to another without also shifting the context is unlikely to change attitudes. This would be as ineffective as the long-standing and fruitless focus on the &quot;deficit model&quot; of environmental&nbsp;communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diabolical challenge for climate communications is that we often think we are gaining valuable insights&nbsp;from research like the Yale study, but more likely we are succumbing to the illusion of asymmetric insight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AKOL, CAMBODIA -- As the sun rises on Tonle Sap Lake, fishermen head out from floating villages like this one, past half-submerged mangroves and flooded shrub land, to check their nets, much as they have for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year, the lake yields about 300,000 tons of fish, making it one of the world's most productive freshwater ecosystems. That and the floods that pulse through it in monsoon season, swelling it to as much as five times its dry-season size, have earned the lake the nickname ''Cambodia's beating heart.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Tonle Sap is in trouble -- from overfishing to feed a fast-growing population, from the cutting of mangrove forests that shelter young fish, from hydroelectric dams upstream, and from the dry seasons that are expected to grow hotter and longer with climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keo Mao, a 42-year-old fisherman from Akol, says he hopes his five children can find a way out of the life that has sustained his family for generations. ''The lake now is not really so good,'' he said. ''There are too many people.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now an international team of researchers has joined local fishermen in an ambitious project to save the Tonle Sap. The scientists are building an intricate computer model that aims to track the vast array of connections between human activity and natural systems as they change over time. Begun in 2012, the model will take several years to complete, while threats to the Tonle Sap continue to mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the hope is to peer into the lake's future to predict how different developmental, economic and regulatory choices may ripple through this interconnected and fast-changing ecosystem, and to plan a sustainable way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charting a Changing Cambodia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henri Mouhot, the 19th-century French explorer who crossed the Tonle Sap on his way to Angkor Wat, said the lake resembled a violin lying diagonally across Cambodia. At its neck, a tributary flows southeast to the Mekong River. On the laptop of Roel Boumans, an ecologist who helped develop the modeling project, the lake and its flood plain are divided into 16 watersheds that he fills with shades of green, yellow and brown, based on vegetation and land-use data from satellite images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The model tells us stories,'' he said, ''and it tests the stories we, as scientists, tell about the how different parts of the system work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with attributes like soil composition, elevation and vegetation, the digital Tonle Sap will soon have what the scientists call ''agents,'' including fish and people. Agents make choices. They change the lake and react to those changes, depending on factors like when enough fish swim into an area to attract predators and fishing boats. Local fishermen are critical to the Tonle Sap modeling project. They have been collecting fish from small research nets, jotting down their species, lengths and weights, and snipping tails for DNA testing. They will also take part in other fieldwork, including water and sediment sampling, household surveys and economic research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambodia's population is growing rapidly, at a rate of nearly 2 percent a year. Many rural Cambodians, including subsistence farmers displaced by land grants to large agribusinesses, have migrated to the Tonle Sap from upland areas. Others come after selling their farmland to pay off debt. From 1998 to 2008, the most recent period studied, the number of full-time Tonle Sap fishermen grew by 38 percent to 38,200, and the number of lakeside farmers, many of whom fish part time, increased 33 percent to 520,800.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The computer model does not yet account for the surging population, but it already has years of data on water levels. By sending blue pulses across the map on his laptop to simulate flooding, Dr. Boumans can calculate where floodwater sediments, shown in oranges and reds, are likely to settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He developed the modeling approach a decade ago with Robert Costanza, an environmental economist now at Australian National University. They called it Mimes, short for multiscale integrated models of ecosystem services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is among the most ambitious of several models to emerge from the movement among ecologists to assign economic values to nature and its processes. Critics warn that such models can lead scientists to discount important data that disagree with their forecasts; others say focusing on ''services'' puts price tags on nature, undervaluing things like biodiversity that aren't bought and sold. The idea's supporters, however, say it aligns nature's interests with our own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the past, it was a conservation and environmental argument pitted against the economic argument,'' said Lewis Incze, a marine ecologist and oceanographer at the University of Maine who is not part of the Tonle Sap project. ''You can still argue about valuation and importance, but these models recognize that this is not one class of argument against another, but a whole family of processes that need to be recognized and accounted for together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Boumans said the Mimes model ''lets you explore the decisions you're making about a landscape and seascape, showing you what's gained and lost over space and time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One set of decisions involves the big dams planned upstream of the Tonle Sap, often portrayed as a trade-off between electricity and food. Fewer than half of Cambodians have reliable access to power; blackouts are common, and costly electricity slows business development and job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But tropical dams typically generate power for just a few decades, while the Tonle Sap has been feeding Cambodia for centuries. Fish are carved in the walls at Angkor Wat, and they supply three-quarters of the animal protein in a country where nearly 40 percent of children are chronically malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 percent of Cambodia's inland fish catch comes from the Tonle Sap, which also supports migratory fish caught upstream, said Chheng Phen, acting director of Cambodia's Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, which is taking part in the modeling project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the Tonle Sap does not function,'' he said, ''then the whole fishery of the Mekong will collapse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coupling of People and Nature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, ecologists have viewed humans in an ecosystem as something of a nuisance -- contaminating samples, skewing data and clouding scientific analyses. ''But the human aspect of an ecosystem is crucial,'' said Jianguo Liu, who leads the International Network of Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems, or Chans-net, a network of 1,300 ecologists, economists, and sociologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The central message of Chans is that humans and nature are coupled, just like husband and wife,'' says Dr. Liu, director of the Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability at Michigan State University. ''They interact, work together, and the impacts are not just one way. There are feedbacks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tonle Sap project is designed to capture those interactions and look for their consequences, often unintended. For instance, increased fishing could actually lead to more fish in the lake, at least for a while. Kevin McCann, an ecologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, says that if fishermen take everything they bring up in their nets, the species that suffer most will be the larger fish that grow and reproduce slowly. With fewer big fish eating the fast-multiplying, small fish, the results will be more fish over all, but reduced biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past decade, data suggest that the lake has been losing its biggest fish -- quarter-ton catfish, stingrays with six-foot wingspans, Siamese carp bigger than the fishermen who caught them -- while the catch of the tiny trey riel, or money fish, has risen slightly. (They are used primarily for prahok, the fermented fish paste that is a staple of Cambodian cooking.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate models forecast longer, hotter dry seasons for Southeast Asia, and more intense monsoon floods. Both changes could disrupt the migration and spawning patterns of Tonle Sap fish, said Sovan Lek, an ecologist at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France, who is a native of Cambodia and a principal investigator in the Tonle Sap project. ''In Europe, the water can go from very cold to very warm, from winter to summer,'' he said. ''Here, the temperature is stable over the whole year, so adaptation to a change will be more difficult.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Million Depend on the Lake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thol Thoeun, a 27-year-old Tonle Sap fisherman, sat on the floor of his floating house and recounted how rats devoured his vegetable garden, how all his money goes to home repairs after monsoons, and how his rickety fishing boat continually takes on water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family came here in 2002, fleeing hard times inland, but times are hard here, too. More than 70 percent of households earn less than $1,000 a year, and many fishermen are in debt, owing nearly $780 on average, according to the Cambodian fisheries administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everyone faces difficulties,'' Mr. Thoeun said. ''Everyone is suffering.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1.5 million people who depend directly on the Tonle Sap, mostly fishers, farmers and their families, are one of the biggest factors in forecasting the lake's future. They can't do much about the dams, most of which are planned beyond Cambodia's borders, nor can they stop global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how they react to changes on the lake will be critically important. If fish catches were to drop by a third, for example, fishermen might have to spend even more time on their boats, or venture into illegal ''no take'' waters, or turn to rice farming. Each choice would affect the ecosystem in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evan Fraser, a geographer at the University of Guelph, will explore these sorts of scenarios with Tonle Sap residents in surveys, interviews and workshops, to begin later this year. His findings will become part of the model. A food-security expert, Dr. Fraser has studied some of history's worst famines, as well as those prevented by tactics like stockpiling food and distributing drought-resistant seeds. His research suggests that no matter how the Tonle Sap changes in the coming years, the right adaptive strategies could mean the difference between a tolerable transition and a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The policy and development challenge is one of managing the transition,'' he said. ''There's no way to stop it.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- He is a Democrat in a marquee Senate race, pressed by a strong Republican in a state with a challenging political environment. So when a new proposal to limit power plant emissions was seen as posing a threat to allies of the Obama administration, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado acted quickly: He embraced the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Coloradans have seen firsthand the harmful effects of climate&nbsp;change, including severe drought, record wildfires and reduced snowpack,'' Mr. Udall said in a statement shortly after the Environmental Protection Agency plan was made public last week. ''The E.P.A.'s draft rule is a good start, and I will fight to ensure it complements the work we have already done in Colorado and provides states the flexibility they need to make it successful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.P.A. proposal to reduce carbon pollution from power plants was deemed a political gift from the Obama administration to Republicans running for Senate seats in the coal-producing states of Kentucky and West Virginia, and an anchor around the necks of their Democratic opponents. Elsewhere, the threat of higher electricity bills and Republican attacks about another federal power grab were supposed to send Democrats scurrying for cover and distance from the White House.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Udall's example shows that not all Democrats look at it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iowa, Representative Bruce Braley, the Democratic Senate nominee, has adopted the same approach as Mr. Udall. ''Reducing our carbon output is not only necessary for the health of the planet, it's an opportunity to continue to improve the health of the Iowa economy -- which is and will remain my No. 1 priority,'' Mr. Braley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other states with competitive Senate races, such as Michigan, Democrats say growing public support for action to curb climate&nbsp;change -- coupled with pronouncements by Republican candidates that human activity is not contributing to it, or their denials that the world is growing warmer -- could help Democrats this year. They say it will definitely make the party stronger heading into the 2016 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Denying the existence of climate&nbsp;change is proving to be a problem for many Republicans right now, and certainly a long-term albatross for the party,'' said Matt Canter, the deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''Republican efforts to squeeze political gain out of this have fallen short.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans scoff at that notion. They say the new proposal has given Republican Senate contenders in Kentucky and West Virginia a huge advantage despite concerted efforts by Democrats there to distance themselves from the president and his plan. Republicans say it has also provided a handicap for Democrats running in energy-supplying states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Five months prior to the most difficult election of their careers, President Obama is turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to their concerns,'' the National Republican Senatorial Committee said in a statement. ''An uphill climb just got even more difficult.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats say that public polling shows broad acceptance of the need to combat climate&nbsp;change and that some recent surveys show large majorities support the idea of emission limits on power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Democrats will welcome the opportunity to use this to talk about the Republicans' dependence on oil company interests and other special interests that oppose carbon regulation for the sake of their own profits,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who conducted a survey in Virginia this week for an environmental group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, which produces both fossil fuels and renewable energy, the political dynamic is much different from the one in coal states. Colorado has moved ahead with its own emissions standards, and Mr. Udall's Republican opponent, Representative Cory Gardner, voted for a plan similar to the federal proposal while serving in the state legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In 2010, Democrats and Republicans in the state worked together knowing that any product we produced would meet Colorado's needs far better than any unelected E.P.A. bureaucrat's plan,'' Mr. Gardner said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight in Colorado is more likely to be about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas, and Mr. Gardner has focused on pressuring Mr. Udall over efforts to impose local government restrictions on the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Democrats in swing states outside the coal belt can capitalize on the emissions rules still seems a difficult proposition to some analysts. Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, said the new E.P.A. proposal could be joined in the minds of voters with turmoil in the administration over the Department of Veterans Affairs and the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How can voters not start to think that this election is a way to protest what he has done?'' Mr. Rothenberg said of the president. ''To the extent it is about the president, it cannot help Democrats.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the White House, the politics of the carbon rule is a no-brainer, officials said. In the months leading up to the announcement, Mr. Obama's top political advisers were united in agreement that the environmental proposal would be a winner for Democrats almost everywhere but in coal country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials and other Democratic strategists say that climate&nbsp;change issues -- and Mr. Obama's decision to push the pollution debate to center stage -- will have even greater benefits for Democrats in presidential campaigns and future congressional elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews, they said the climate issue has become a way for voters to judge a candidate's character and broader outlook on the world. Officials compared the issue to the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage, especially among young people and suburban women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's political advisers said that candidates who opposed regulations on pollution or denied that climate&nbsp;change was real were likely to be seen by those voters as ideologically rigid and unwilling to accept scientists' conclusions. That will hurt Republican efforts to expand their support among young people and women, White House officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to brand Republicans as anti-science or supporters of companies that produce the most pollution has become easier, officials said, because the party has moved away from acceptance of climate&nbsp;change and climate regulations. Some Republicans have sought recently to soften the way they talk about the issue, saying they believe in climate&nbsp;change but do not attribute it to human action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, as recently as five years ago, leading Republican politicians embraced so-called cap-and-trade regulations; now, the party's leadership vigorously opposes them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garin, the pollster, said the hardening opposition among many Republicans to the science of climate&nbsp;change threatens to undermine their efforts to win back the White House in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Republicans have created a negative branding around the perception that it is a backward-looking party,'' he said. ''That perception gets deepened by their rejection of climate science.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials point to two examples as evidence of the problem for Republicans -- and the potential opportunity for Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, when the recession was near its worst and Republican fortunes were on the rise, voters in California easily defeated a proposal that would have suspended the state's aggressive air pollution laws until the economic struggles were over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in 2013, Terry McAuliffe, then the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, ran television ads attacking his Republican opponent for denying the existence of climate&nbsp;change. Mr. McAuliffe won.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the big news was that the Obama administration had unveiled a new Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon emissions from United States power plants 30 percent by 2030.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But E.P.A. legislation aside, it has already been a banner year for climate news. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change's Fifth Assessment Report confirmed once again that human-caused global warming is proceeding rapidly. Last month, scientists reported the irreversible disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and, closer to home, the National Climate Assessment asserted that the United States is already falling victim to severe, global warming-related droughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of this, a new series from The New York Times called The Big Fix will examine potential solutions to climate&nbsp;change. In the first installment, Justin Gillis examines a worldwide experiment that may create economic incentives for companies to invest in emission-control projects. One such project takes Wisconsin dairy cows and extracts power from their excrement, which is paid for by California. See how that works in this slideshow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For latecomers to the global warming discussion, a new digital Flipboard called Temperature Rising showcases some of the Times's best climate coverage to date. Once you're all caught up, the Opinion section's DotEarth blog offers continuous, breaking climate news and occasional analyses -- did you know, for example, that Americans take the term ''global warming'' far more seriously than ''climate&nbsp;change''?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">The go-it-alone president stumbles as he tries to seize second-term agenda: From tackling global warming to helping free a US soldier held by the Taliban, President Obama has launched a series of eye-catching initiatives to show he is in charge. But, reports Paul Lewis from Washington, his efforts are backfiring</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For six months, ever since Barack Obama used his State of the Union speech to declare that if necessary he would bypass obstructionist Republicans in Congress and use his executive authority to act alone, critics have bemoaned the lack of any follow-up. Obama has seemed stuck, dithering over the appropriate response to the Ukraine crisis and only using his executive powers in a limited way to enact change on the domestic front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until, that is, 10 days ago, when a newly emboldened Obama sprang into action, giving Washington a lesson in the perils of a go-it-alone presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the space of a few days, he launched a new foreign policy doctrine, dispatched an embattled secretary of veterans' affairs, secured the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier in Taliban captivity whom he swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, and unveiled historic cuts to pollution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That probably makes the past fortnight the most eventful of Obama's second term. But it has also been one of his most calamitous. All four steps were intended to show a president taking control of the agenda. Yet each move either backfired or provided ammunition to critics constructing a narrative of a White House under siege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Stephen Wayne, an expert on the American presidency from Georgetown University, says it is &quot;par for the course&quot; for presidents in their second term to stumble then hunker down in the White House. In recent times, he says, only Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton have bucked that trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 44th president appears especially isolated, as though he has given up trying to forge alliances on Capitol Hill. &quot;President Obama has a lot of strong points, but social interaction with people he doesn't know is not one of them,&quot; says Wayne. &quot;He's rational, he's information-driven, he's very smart. But he's a loner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama is no longer just unpopular among Republicans. Democrats now fear his reputation - as a partisan, remote chief executive whose approval ratings have been languishing below 50% - will damage their prospects ahead of November's midterm elections. &quot;This is the guy who used to be the king of winning elections,&quot; a top Democrat says, on condition of anonymity. &quot;Now he has become our millstone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's difficult two weeks began with his address to cadets at the US military academy at West Point, which was billed as a key foreign policy speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's first term is remembered for his decision to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Hawks argue the 18 months of Obama's second stint have shown him as timid abroad - pulling back from intervention in Syria, flinching from a tough response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, and naively pursuing a negotiated nuclear settlement with Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Point address was to be Obama's riposte: an attempt to frame his philosophy for foreign affairs, carving out a middle ground between George W Bush's military aggression and the far more isolationist policy now demanded by America's war-weary public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's message of soft power over military prowess got a predictably frosty reception from graduating cadets. Neither did the speech go down well with the foreign policy fraternity, receiving poor reviews from both left and right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times said the speech &quot;did not match the hype, was largely uninspiring, lacked strategic sweep and is unlikely to quiet his detractors&quot;. The Wall Street Journal compared Obama's attempt to assemble a coherent foreign policy agenda to &quot;Tom Hanks trying to survive in Cast Away: whatever's left from the wreckage will have to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning of the speech, White House officials were working hard to manage another slow-developing shipwreck: the scandal over healthcare provision for war veterans, which had been building for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Veterans Affairs manages an enormous network of hospitals and medical facilities to provide health cover to more Americans than any other health organisation, public or private. In America, care for veterans is sacrosanct, but the system is straining at the seams, unable to cope with Vietnam veterans entering old age as well as the influx of returning troops from the Iraq and Afghan wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What began as a story about a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona massaging its figures to conceal the length of waiting lists - and claims that as many as 40 veterans may have died while waiting for care - quickly spiralled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two inquiries concluded the cover-up was in fact systemic, affecting VA hospitals across the country, and led to a clamour in Congress for the resignation of Obama's secretary for veterans' affairs, Eric Shinseki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not want to let him go but, two days after his West Point speech, relented and agreed to Shinseki's departure. Obama looked like a president whose hand had been forced. By then at least 116 members of Congress had called for Shinseki's resignation, 35 of them Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shinseki was the second cabinet-level official to resign in two months. The first was Kathleen Sebelius, the health secretary who presided over the botched rollout of the healthcare website that was the linchpin of &quot;Obamacare&quot;, the president's health reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's supporters maintain that the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2009, will be remembered as the signature achievement of his first term. But they concede he lacks a similar landmark in his second. The comprehensive immigration reform he and his backers in the Senate sought to achieve is now dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for another agenda-setting intervention goes some way to explaining why the president chose to take decisive action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had already tried and failed, in 2010, to get a climate&nbsp;change bill through Congress. On Monday, in the first major example of the executive action he threatened to wield at the State of the Union, his administration unveiled historic environment rules, imposing cuts from power plants by 30% by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules, formally announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, marked the first time any US president has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power stations. They infuriated Republicans, the business lobby and a handful of Democrats campaigning for election in emissions-heavy states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cuts were a courageous move, probably in step with an emerging public belief that sacrifices are necessary over carbon emissions. Neera Tanden, president of the thinktank Centre for American Progress, says it was an example of a decision Obama knew he needed to take quickly, conscious that states needed time to implement the rules before his term ends in 2016. The climate&nbsp;change rules, Tanden says, will be &quot;the most far-reaching executive action the president will take in his presidency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How then did the White House allow such a pivotal moment to be sandwiched between the Shinseki resignation and the storm over the release of Bergdahl?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, one administration official admits the White House was caught &quot;entirely off-guard&quot;, failing to anticipate the response to the release of five Taliban fighters. The administration failed to predict how quickly Republicans would turn against a 28-year-old soldier who walked off his Afghan posting in 2009 and had been described as a deserter by some ex-members of his platoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's decision to announce the exchange in the Rose Garden, flanked by Bergdahl's father, Bob - a vocal critic of the war effort - was considered a mistake. So, too, was the claim by Susan Rice, Obama's national security adviser, that Bergdahl had served with &quot;honour and distinction&quot;. But it was the complaint that Obama had, once again, bypassed Congress to authorise the trade that has been most telling. The White House did not dispute that Obama was technically required to notify Congress 30 days prior to the release from Guantanamo. It simply said there was a risk to Bergdahl's life that justified side-stepping the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN it comes to dealing with the world's climate and energy challenges I have a simple rule: change America, change the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If America raises its clean energy standards, not only will others follow -- others who have hid behind our inaction -- we'll also stimulate our industry to invent more of the clean air, clean power and energy efficiency systems, and move them down the cost curve faster, so U.S. companies will be leaders in this next great global industry and American consumers will be the first to benefit. That is why the new Environmental Protection Agency rules President Obama proposed last week to curb carbon emissions from power plants are so pivotal. You can't make power systems greener without making them smarter -- smarter materials, software or design. One new ruling will not change the world -- and we have to be careful that this one doesn't replace our addiction to coal with an addiction to natural gas alone. But coming at a time when clean energy technologies are becoming more competitive, and when awareness of climate&nbsp;change is becoming more pervasive, this E.P.A. ruling should give a real boost to clean power and efficiency innovation and make our country more resilient, healthy, secure -- and respected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks ago, as he was drawing up these new emission rules, I interviewed President Obama in the White House library about climate and energy. Following are highlights. (The interview is also featured in the final episode of Showtime's climate series, ''Years of Living Dangerously'' airing on Monday.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, Obama is aware that we can't just keep burning oil, coal and gas until they run out. As the International Energy Agency warned, ''no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050'' -- unless carbon capture and storage technology is widely deployed -- otherwise we'll bust through the limit of a 2 degree Celsius rise in average temperature that climate scientists believe will unleash truly disruptive ice melt, sea level rise and weather extremes. The rest has to stay in the ground, and we need to steadily find cleaner alternatives and more energy efficiency. I asked Obama if he agreed with that analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Science is science,'' he said. ''And there is no doubt that if we burned all the fossil fuel that's in the ground right now that the planet's going to get too hot and the consequences could be dire.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we can't burn it all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're not going to be able to burn it all. Over the course of the next several decades, we're going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy. And we're not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we're no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon. ... But I very much believe in keeping that 2 [degree] Celsius target as a goal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is so, your environmental supporters wonder why you keep touting how much we're still exploring for oil, coal and natural gas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have got to meet folks where they are,'' said Obama. ''We've gone through, obviously, in the last five years, a tough economic crisis. ... I don't always lead with the climate&nbsp;change issue because if you right now are worried about whether you've got a job or if you can pay the bills, the first thing you want to hear is how do I meet the immediate problem? One of the hardest things in politics is getting a democracy to deal with something now where the payoff is long term or the price of inaction is decades away. What we've tried to do is continually find ways in which we can make progress, recognizing that we're not immediately going to get people to abandon the old gas-guzzler'' [because] ''they can't afford an electric car.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every morning you get a security briefing from the intelligence community on global threats; do you now also get the same on environmental threats?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I do,'' said Obama. Science adviser ''John Holdren typically makes presentations when there are new findings,'' and his reports show that environmental stresses are now impacting both foreign and domestic policy. For instance, wildfires are now ''consuming a larger and larger portion of the Department of Interior budget. And if we continue to fund fighting fires the same way we've done in the past, all the money for everything else -- for conservation, for maintenance of forests -- all that money gets used up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the area he's just as worried about, said Obama, ''is how climate&nbsp;change could end up having profound national security implications in poorer countries. We're obviously concerned about drought in California or hurricanes and floods along our coastlines and the possibility of more powerful storms or more severe droughts. All of those things are bread-and-butter issues that touch on American families. But when you start seeing how these shifts can displace people -- entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that -- that gets your attention. There's a reason why the quadrennial defense review -- [which] the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on -- identified climate&nbsp;change as one of our most significant national security problems. It's not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria couldn't manage a four-year drought when it had a government, and that drought helped fuel the uprising there, because the government did nothing for the people. Imagine what will happen if they have another prolonged drought and they've destroyed half their country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Which gives you a sense of what happens in a lot of these countries that are just barely hanging on,'' said Obama. ''They don't have a lot of margin for error, and that has national security implications. When people are hungry, when people are displaced, when there are a lot of young people, particularly young men, who are drifting without prospects for the future, the fertility of the soil for terrorism ends up being significant. And it can have an impact on us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the one thing you would still like to see us do to address climate&nbsp;change? Said Obama: put a price on carbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way we've solved previous problems, like acid rain, he noted, ''was that we said: 'We're going to charge you if you're releasing this stuff into the atmosphere, but we're going to let you figure out -- with the marketplace and with the technology' '' how best to mitigate it. But ''you can't keep dumping it out in the atmosphere and making everybody else pay for it. So if there's one thing I would like to see, it'd be for us to be able to price the cost of carbon emissions. ... We've obviously seen resistance from the Republican side of the aisle on that. And out of fairness, there's some Democrats who've been concerned about it as well, because regionally they're very reliant on heavy industry and old-power plants. ... I still believe, though, that the more we can show the price of inaction -- that billions and potentially trillions of dollars are going to be lost because we do not do something about it -- ultimately leads us to be able to say, 'Let's go ahead and help the marketplace discourage this kind of activity.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does natural gas fit in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, it can be a blessing and a curse. Natural gas emits only half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned, but if methane leaks when oil companies extract it from the ground in a sloppy manner -- methane is far more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide -- it can wipe out all the advantages of natural gas over coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natural gas, the president said, ''is a useful bridge'' to span ''where we are right now and where we hope to be -- where we've got entirely clean energy economies based around the world.'' Environmentalists, he added, ''are right, though, to be concerned if it's done badly, then you end up having methane gas emitted. And we know how to do it properly. But right now what we've got to do is make sure that there are industry standards that everybody is observing.'' That doesn't ''necessarily mean that it has to be a national law,'' he said. ''You could have a series of states working together -- and, hopefully, industry working together -- to make sure that the extraction of natural gas is done safely.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you ever want to just go off on the climate deniers in Congress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Yeah, absolutely,'' the president said with a laugh. ''Look, it's frustrating when the science is in front of us. ... We can argue about how. But let's not argue about what's going on. The science is compelling. ... The baseline fact of climate&nbsp;change is not something we can afford to deny. And if you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history, then you've got to recognize this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and that the planet faces. The good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of their politicians'' -- as people start to see the cost of cleaning up for hurricanes like Sandy or the drought in California -- and when ''those start multiplying, then people start thinking, 'You know what? We're going to reward politicians who talk to us honestly and seriously about this problem.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president added: ''The person who I consider to be the greatest president of all time, Abraham Lincoln, was pretty consistent in saying, 'With public opinion there's nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there's nothing I can get done,' and so part of my job over these next two and a half years and beyond is trying to shift public opinion. And the way to shift public opinion is to really focus in on the fact that if we do nothing our kids are going to be worse off.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick, I argued, is to find that fine line between making people feel the problem is urgent, but not insoluble so they just say: If the end is nigh, let's party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The most important thing is to guard against cynicism,'' responded the president. ''I want to make sure that everybody who's been watching this program or listening to this interview doesn't start concluding that, well, we're all doomed, there's nothing we can do about it. There's a lot we can do about it. It's not going to happen as fast or as smoothly or as elegantly as we like, but, if we are persistent, we will make progress.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: Ignoring climate change, the biggest threat facing the world, is simply not a moral option for Tony Abbott, Australia or the G20. It would be a huge mistake for the prime minister to make.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the week that US president Obama announced major new carbon pollution regulations and China announced it would introduce a cap on carbon emissions by the end of the decade, climate&nbsp;change-denying Australia prime minister Tony Abbott has taken climate&nbsp;change of the G20 agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia took over the chair of the G20 group of nations -- the 20 largest economies on earth -- in December. While this would normally be a moment of national pride, prime minister Abbott had lurched from one foreign policy gaffe to the next, compounding the ignominy with his morally negligent policy to abolish Australia's carbon price.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott's wilful disregard for the risks of global warming&nbsp;come as Australia reached yet another landmark climate record: the Autumn (fall) month of May was unusually hot across the entire eastern seaboard of the continent. According to Sarah Perkins from the Climate Council:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exception of May 3, no daily maximum at Sydney's&nbsp;Observatory Hill&nbsp;has been below 20&deg;C. So far, May's daily maximum temperatures have averaged just under 4&deg;C above normal. May 25 was an exceptional 8&deg;C warmer than normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US is Australia's most important international ally, and traditionally conservative prime minister from the Liberal-National party, like Abbott's predecessor John Howard, have been in lock step with US administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard for example famously supported the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq, and followed Bush's lead by refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol. (Recently Howard said that his &quot;instinct&quot; was that climate&nbsp;change was &quot;exaggerated&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Abbott is showing no such deference to Democratic president Obama. So skeptical are the Australian public about Abbott's regard for the president,&nbsp;Twitter started trending with the hashtag&nbsp;#WhatAbbottwillsaytoObama; the vast majority of tweets are critiques of Abbott, and his climate policies are especially singled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott's insistence that Obama's &quot;direct action&quot; policy is the equivalent to his own would be&nbsp;the public policy and diplomatic equivalent of Twitter-trolling if it weren't so serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas president Obama proposes to significantly reduce carbon pollution emissions from power stations and achieve a 17 percent economy wide reduction in carbon emissions, Abbott proposes to pay major polluters to effectively keep polluting&nbsp;which is unlikely to achieve even the paltry 5 percent reduction target. President Obama has been advocating for a cap-and-trade laws (which were blocked by the Republicans); Abbott not only ran a four-year scare campaign against Australia's cap-and-trade laws, but now proposed to abolish them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global climate denialism has long been given mainstream airing, especially during the Bush years. Bush and his vice president Cheney were oil-men after all. However, the past six or so years have seen governments increasingly willing to take action, even while meaningful multilateral action is stymied by a small group of nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott is ensuring that Australia rejoins that fringe group of nations, petro-states like Canada, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who have snubbed or actively blocked multilateral attempts to reduce global emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia aligned itself with nations like these at Warsaw in November last year during the COP 19 United Nations climate meeting; Abbott refused to send a minister to the talks and put forward no new commitments at the meeting. Back home, he derided climate action as &quot;socialism masquerading as environmentalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in December 2013, he said that adding climate&nbsp;change to the agenda of the G20 was &quot;clutter&quot;. At the same time&nbsp;he attacked&nbsp;Climate Chief Christiana Figueres as &quot;talking through her hat&quot; for daring to suggest that Australia's unseasonal bush fires were related to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, under Stephen Harper, is the only country in the world to have withdrawn from the Kyoto protocol, almost entirely due to the enormous and unseemly influence of the fossil fuel industry embodied by the tar-sands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia, under Tony Abbott, is attempting to make Australia the first nation on earth to abolish a legislated price on carbon. His misguided and harmful climate denialism is now affecting&nbsp;other countries at these international forums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These actions --&nbsp;opposing the addition of climate&nbsp;change to the global agenda at the G20 meeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;abolishing the carbon price -- are morally negligent. The consequences of inaction on climate&nbsp;change are foreseeable, and doing nothing will result in real, substantial and long-lasting harm to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's worse, Abbott and his ministers have engaged in a relentless campaign to undermine and attack the credibility and legitimacy of climate science and scientists, with the intentional aim of undermining the moral case and public support for policy action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has endorsed a &quot;carbon budget&quot; of one trillion tonnes of carbon in order for the earth to stay below&nbsp;2&deg;C of warming. It is increasingly likely that the&nbsp;2&deg;C of warming was wildly optimistic and our carbon budget is in fact far lower than 1 trillion tonnes. Even to stay within the budget, global emissions would need to drop immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott's &quot;direct action&quot; plan, which no serious economist or scientist agrees will actually result in fewer emissions, combined with abolishing the carbon price, will actually worsen our &quot;carbon budget&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, major fossil fuel companies like Shell, Chevron and Exxon are actually incorporating carbon pricing and caps into their long-term financial planning, despite lobbying furiously against those laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Australia conducts itself at international forums, and in its interactions with the US and China on climate&nbsp;change, is of global importance. Australia, despite critics who claim our actions on climate can have no consequence, is one of the world's richest nations, and we are one of the largest polluters in the world and the largest per capita. Our impact lies not only in the technologies we produce&nbsp;and&nbsp;the commodities we export, but in the example we set to developing nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Abbott continues to act as the stalking horse for global climate&nbsp;change deniers, he will not just weaken his own legitimacy as an international leader, but he may do long-lasting harm to Australia's position as a constructive middle-power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring climate&nbsp;change, the biggest threat facing the world's economy, environment and population, is simply not a moral option for Tony Abbott, Australia or the G20. It would be a huge mistake for the prime minister to make.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Soaring costs of resource extraction require transition to post-industrial 'circular economy' to avoid collapse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new landmark scientific report drawing on the work of the world's leading mineral experts forecasts that industrial civilisation's extraction of critical minerals and fossil fuel resources is reaching the limits of economic feasibility, and could lead to a collapse of key infrastructures unless new ways to manage resources are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peer-reviewed study - the 33rd Report to the Club of Rome - is authored by Prof Ugo Bardi of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Florence, where he teaches physical chemistry. It includes specialist contributions from fifteen senior scientists and experts across the fields of geology, agriculture, energy, physics, economics, geography, transport, ecology, industrial ecology, and biology, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Club of Rome is a Swiss-based global think tank founded in 1968 consisting of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists and business leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its latest report, to be released on 12th June, conducts a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of mining, and argues that the increasing costs of mineral extraction due to pollution, waste, and depletion of low-cost sources will eventually make the present structure of industrial civilisation unsustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the report's focus is on the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI), which measures the amount of energy needed to extract resources. While making clear that &quot;we are not running out of any mineral,&quot; the report finds that &quot;extraction is becoming more and more difficult as the easy ores are depleted. More energy is needed to maintain past production rates, and even more is needed to increase them.&quot; As a consequence, despite large quantities of remaining mineral reserves:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The production of many mineral commodities appears to be on the verge of decline... we may be going through a century-long cycle that will lead to the disappearance of mining as we know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last decade has seen the world shift to more expensive and difficult to extract fossil fuel resources, in the form of unconventional forms of oil and gas, which have much lower levels of EROEI than conventional oil. Even with technological breakthroughs in fracking and associated drilling techniques, this trend is unlikely to reverse significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former senior executive in Australia's oil, gas and coal industry, Ian Dunlop, describes in the report how fracking can rise production &quot;rapidly to a peak, but it then declines rapidly, too, often by 80 to 95 percent over the first three years.&quot; This means that often &quot;several thousand wells&quot; are needed for a single shale play to provide &quot;a return on investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average EROEI to run &quot;industrial society as we know it&quot; is about 8 to 10. Shale oil and gas, tar sands, and coal seam gas are all &quot;at, or below, that level if their full costs are accounted for... Thus fracking, in energy terms, will not provide a source on which to develop sustainable global society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Club of Rome report also applies the EROEI analysis to extraction of coal and uranium. World coal production will peak by 2050 latest, and could peak as early as 2020. US coal production has already peaked, and future production will be determined largely by China. But rising domestic demand from the latter, and from India, could generate higher prices and shortages in the near future: &quot;Therefore, there is definitely no scope for substituting for oil and gas with coal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for global uranium supplies, the report says that current uranium production from mines is already insufficient to fuel existing nuclear reactors, a gap being filled by recovery of uranium military stockpiles and old nuclear warheads. While the production gap could be closed at current levels of demand, a worldwide expansion of nuclear power would be unsustainable due to &quot;gigantic investments&quot; needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report contributor Michael Dittmar, a nuclear physicist at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, argues that despite large quantities of uranium in the Earth's crust, only a &quot;limited numbers of deposits&quot; are &quot;concentrated enough to be profitably mined.&quot; Mining less concentrated deposits would require &quot;far more energy than the mined uranium could ultimately produce.&quot; The rising costs of uranium mining, among other costs, has meant that nuclear power investment is tapering off. Proposals to extract uranium from seawater are currently &quot;useless&quot; because &quot;the energy needed to extract and process uranium from seawater would be about the same as the energy that could be obtained by the same uranium using the current nuclear technology.&quot; Therefore within this decade, the report forecasts an &quot;unavoidable&quot; production decline from existing uranium mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Geological Survey data analysed by the report shows that chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, platinum-palladium, copper, zinc, cadmium, titanium, and tin will face peak production followed by declines within this century. This is because declared reserves are often &quot;more hypothetical than measured&quot;, meaning the &quot;assumption of mineral bonanzas... are far removed from reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the report highlights the fate of copper, lithium, nickel and zinc. Physicist Prof Rui Namorado Rosa projects an &quot;imminent slowdown of copper availability&quot; in the report. Although production has grown exponentially, the grade of the minerals mined is steadily declining, lifting mining costs. 'Peak copper' is likely to hit by 2040, but could even occur within the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Production of lithium production, presently used for batteries electric cars, would also be strained under a large-scale electrification of transport infrastructure and vehicles, according to contributor Emilia Suomalainen, an industrial ecologist of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Sustainable lithium production requires 80-100% recycling - currently this stands at less than 1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nickel and zinc, which are used to combat iron and steel corrosion and for electricity storage in batteries, also could face production peaks in just &quot;a few decades&quot; - though nickel might be extended some 80 years - according to engineer and metals specialist Philippe Bihoux:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The easily exploited part of the reserves has been already removed, and so it will be increasingly difficult and expensive to invest in and exploit nickel and zinc mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While substitution could help in many cases, it would also be costly and uncertain, requiring considerable investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most alarming trend in mineral depletion concerns phosphorous, which is critical to fertilise soil and sustain agriculture. While phosphorous reserves are not running out, physical, energy and economic factors mean only a small percentage of it can be mined. Crop yield on 40 percent of the world's arable land is already limited by economical phosphorus availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Club of Rome study, physicist Patrick Dery says that several major regions of rock phosphate production - such as the island of Nauru and the US, which is the world's second largest producer - are post-peak and now declining, with global phosphorous supplies potentially becoming insufficient to meet agricultural demand within 30-40 years. The problem can potentially be solved as phosphorous can be recycled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parallel trend documented in the report by Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) agronomist Toufic El Asmar is an accelerating decline in land productivity due to industrial agricultural methods, which are degrading the soil by as much as 50% in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that the report is &quot;an effective piece of work&quot; to assess the planet's mineral wealth &quot;within the framework of sustainability.&quot; Its findings offer a &quot;valuable basis for discussions on mineral policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the window for meaningful policy action is closing rapidly. &quot;The main alarm bell is the trend in the prices of mineral commodities,&quot; Prof Bardi told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prices have gone up by a factor 3-5 and have remained at these level for the past 5-6 years. They are not going to go down again, because they are caused by irreversible increases in production costs. These prices are already causing the decline of the less efficient economies (say, Italy, Greece, Spain, etc.). We are not at the inversion point yet, but close - less than a decade?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN working group devising the sustainable development goals (SDGs) has pared down its list of proposed target areas from 19 to 16, raising hopes of a more concise framework for challenges such as eradicating poverty, ensuring equality and tackling climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDGs, which will supersede the millennium development goals (MDGs) when they expire next year, will be established at a UN summit in September 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest areas of focus (pdf) range from poverty eradication, building shared prosperity and promoting equality to climate&nbsp;change, conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources, oceans and seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The working group has reduced the number of areas by eliding some of the earlier categories, bringing together poverty eradication and equality as well as economic growth, employment and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new goals will target the eradication of extreme poverty - defined as the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day - by 2030, and aim to ensure equality of economic opportunity for all women and men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On health, the group suggests a target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio to less than 40 per 100,000 by 2030, and ending the epidemics of HIV and Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases by the same date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the group's May meeting, climate&nbsp;change proposals include taking &quot;urgent and significant action&quot; to mitigate the effects of global warming, agreeing a target based on the outcome of the 2015 UN climate&nbsp;change conference in Paris, and building &quot;resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-induced hazards in all vulnerable countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the European commission called on the world to redouble its efforts to end extreme poverty, arguing that both the technology and resources exist to achieve that goal in the next few decades. &quot;There is no excuse for us failing to do so, and avoiding it must be our stated commitment,&quot; said European development commissioner Andris Piebalgs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can only be done through growth and development which is sustainable. We need to find solutions that truly balance economic, social and environmental objectives. And we need to bring together governments, but also civil society, private sector and citizens to set up a global framework that will ensure a decent life for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European environment commissioner, Janez Potocnik, said a new framework was needed &quot;to rally the international community to tackle the intertwined challenges of eliminating poverty [and] improving wellbeing while ensuring that progress is sustainable within planetary boundaries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight MDGs aim to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty; achieve universal primary education; promote gender equality and empower women; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health; combat HIV, Aids, malaria and other diseases; ensure environmental sustainability; and develop a global partnership for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although significant progress has been made in tackling poverty, the goal of reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters is unlikely to be met in Africa and much of Asia, while the MDG to reduce the mortality of children aged under-five by two-thirds is unlikely to be achieved in sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia and Oceania.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulation of power plant emissions signals the beginning of a fight over coal and climate&nbsp;change. Any chance of a resolution is likely to depend on the combatants agreeing to a reduction in emissions in exchange for help to coal-dependent regions and assistance to workers struggling with higher energy costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that way, the so-called War on Coal is reminiscent of the War on Tobacco during the 1990s. Then, federal and state officials keyed in on a widely reviled product pulled from the earth in some of the nation's poorest regions, intent on regulating it to minimize its health effects and societal damage. A truce took hold in large part because workers dependent on it for their livelihoods -- and the lawmakers intent on defending it -- were compensated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We really were looking for a way to reimburse the states for the payments they were making for people hurt by disease, and to help the states that would be impacted most negatively if demand dropped'' for tobacco, said Richard Blumenthal, a leader in the fight against tobacco as attorney general of Connecticut and now a Democratic senator. ''There is absolutely a way to do it again, and in the long run, those regions would be much healthier financially and economically to be less dependent on one product, especially a product of finite quantity in the ground, than to continue to eat, live and breathe coal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the public may not be ready to take up arms against climate&nbsp;change the way it was open to battling cigarettes, said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist who recalled polling that he commissioned on the climate issue in 2000 as a senior adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona. At the time, he said, around 80 percent of respondents thought global warming could be sufficiently dealt with through recycling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the end, smoking became unacceptable. That was not a legal statement. It was a social statement, and consensus was broad and has held for a long time,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''Maybe you get there on carbon emissions, but right now, this is an issue for the elites.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though there are significant differences between the fights over coal and tobacco, the numerous parallels offer a potential road map to a settled peace. The burning of both causes adverse health effects. The affected regions overlap in Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina, and they are similarly struggling. (Wyoming, the No.&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[0/00]1 coal producer, did not have a stake in the tobacco fight.) For years, the producers of both have denied and funded the denial of what a vast majority of scientists agree on: the damaging results of the products' use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's method of weaning the nation from each product -- by raising the price -- has a regressive impact. In the case of carbon emissions, it hits not just the poor who can least afford higher energy prices but also those in rural areas who tend to drive long distances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of raising the cost of fossil fuels would be broader than taxing tobacco. Smokers, in the end, can quit, difficult as that may be. A Montana rancher cannot give up his pickup truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Banzhaf, a law professor who is against tobacco, said opponents of climate&nbsp;change have much to learn from the long struggle against tobacco. In that fight, legal action was aimed not only at beating the tobacco companies in court. It was intended to force the release of internal documents that showed the companies had known of the health effects of their product, had hidden it, and had financed efforts to muddy the public's understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-tobacco forces did not simply aim to raise the cost of tobacco. They targeted the industry's tools of promotion: advertising, lobbying and its think tank, the Tobacco Institute. Legal action was meant to alleviate the broad societal cost of smoking -- higher Medicaid costs, more intensive use of the health care system and thus higher taxes. By demonstrating how everyone was hurt, tobacco opponents tried to engage the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most important, they sought to undercut the economic argument that kept tobacco-state lawmakers firmly on the industry's side, said Rick Boucher, a former Democratic congressman who represented Virginia tobacco growers and its coal mines. The bulk of tobacco settlement funds in Virginia went to economic development programs to help move farmers to other livelihoods and to bolster the tobacco regions' infrastructures, including broadband deployment and water and sewer system construction, Mr. Boucher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That helped ease opposition to the settlement in Congress and led eventually to legislation allowing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. After more than a decade of fighting, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law in 2009 with little fanfare -- or even notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The idea of buying off people, as repugnant as that sounds to some, makes a lot of sense,'' Mr. Banzhaf said. ''Why pay off the coal companies? It's simply analysis. Here is the cost if we don't. Here is the cost if we do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, numerous economists have tried to devise a carbon tax that would be less harmful to the working class by using part of the proceeds to lower other taxes hitting workers. Last year, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center explored using a carbon tax to generate the revenue to lower the corporate income tax, with tax rebates to help workers. That would help ease business opposition to carbon regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina and advocate for free-market solutions to climate&nbsp;change, said coal states needed to prepare for the transition, and policy makers needed to focus on making it as least wrenching as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It cannot be sugarcoated,'' said Mr. Inglis, executive director of the Energy and Enterprise Initiative. ''There's no way everyone in coal in Kentucky or West Virginia is going to go out and get a job putting up solar cells.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lessons of the tobacco settlement can go only so far, Mr. Boucher said. Coal is woven more deeply into the fabric of coal-dependent regions of Appalachia and the West then tobacco ever was. The cost of compensating such regions for the loss of some of the last, good-paying union jobs may be too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Blumenthal said that considering how the sale of carbon emissions permits to industry or a carbon tax could help the regions most hurt is ''a very important thought.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Going into the tobacco debate, we ignored the effects on tobacco-growing regions, but in the end, we found some of our strongest allies were tobacco farmers who knew their days were limited. They were the last generation of many who farmed that crop, but they saw those days ending and they wanted a different future for their kids,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''I don't know anyone who has seriously considered enlisting the coal workers. I think this is an area that deserves a lot of exploration.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey in Britain, uses a nifty back-of-the-envelope calculation to underscore the challenge of giving the world's poor a shot at prosperity while preventing a global climate disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's accept, he proposes, that citizens of developing nations are entitled to become roughly as rich in 2050 as Europeans. Let's take note that the world will be home to more than nine billion people by then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would it take, then, to prevent the Earth's temperature from rising more than 3.6 degrees -- 2 degrees Celsius -- above its level before the industrial era, which is generally considered the limit beyond which global warming risks violent and unpredictable environmental upheaval to the world we all share?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming incomes in Europe grow 2 percent a year between now and then, Professor Jackson calculates, by 2050 the world economy could emit at most six grams of carbon dioxide for every dollar it produced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are nowhere near that efficient. Advanced nations emit 60 times that much, according to the Energy Information Administration. Developing nations emit 90 times that much. It's enough to make a sustainable development expert despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Are we really committed to eradicating poverty? Are we serious about reducing carbon emissions? De we genuinely care about resource scarcity, deforestation, biodiversity loss?'' Mr. Jackson wrote. ''Or are we so blinded by conventional wisdom that we daren't do the sums for fear of revealing the truth?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth, he concluded, is ''ecologically unsustainable.'' We must start thinking about how to live without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last month, I ultimately disagreed with Professor Jackson's provocative conclusion, which he published in his 2009 book, ''Prosperity Without Growth.'' Still, his central observation is valid: Humanity is hitting hard against the limit of the planet's carrying capacity. The world's leaders have yet to rise to the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson's observation came vividly to mind this week when the Obama administration unveiled its much-anticipated rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions at the nation's power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal is the centerpiece of President Obama's new strategy against climate&nbsp;change, following his inability to push through Congress a proposal during his first term to put a price on CO^2 emissions. Perhaps most important, it is supposed to be a sign, after decades of dithering, that the United States is ready to lead the world's effort to put limits on the heat-trapping gases that, experts agree, are changing the climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It really does send a signal to the rest of the world,'' said Kevin Kennedy, head of the United States Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute, a research organization devoted to sustainable development. ''It reinforces for many international players that the United States is going to be a serious player.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once one gets past the initial enthusiasm, however, the proposal falls far short of the standard scientists have set. The numbers, to put it in Professor Jackson's terms, don't quite add up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules call for a 30 percent reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide by the nation's power plants by the year 2030, compared with a base in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a number to dismiss easily, particularly given the political and economic challenges that stand in the way of achieving it. Power plants are the biggest carbon polluters in the country. But the number is also not as big as it looks. For starters, half the job has been done already. By 2012, the recession and the electricity industry's switch from coal to less-polluting natural gas had cut power generators' emissions by almost 16 percent from their level in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, on their own, the new targets fall short of the promise President Obama first made at the world's climate summit in Copenhagen five years ago and pledged formally at a summit in Canc&uacute;n, Mexico, the following year: that by 2020 the United States' total greenhouse gas emissions would be 17 percent lower than in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its assessment of paths toward climate&nbsp;change mitigation, published in April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change pointed out, in its usual understated way, that ''the current trajectory of global annual and cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases is inconsistent with widely discussed goals of limiting global warming at 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial level.'' It added: ''the assumptions needed to have a likely chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees are very difficult to satisfy in real-world conditions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed. Rather than a bold stride into the vanguard of the battle against climate&nbsp;change, the new proposals from the E.P.A. offer just enough progress to shuffle along with a world that unfailingly falls short of delivering what is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The models reviewed by the I.P.C.C. suggest that to make it ''as likely as not'' that global temperatures remain below the 2-degree threshold throughout this century, we may need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half by 2050 -- only 36 years from now -- and much more after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, we haven't even started. In the first decade of this century, emissions actually grew at twice the pace of the preceding three decades, fueled mostly by China and its vast appetite for coal. And even if every country, including the United States, were to deliver on the pledges made in Canc&uacute;n, the world's greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 would still be greater than in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to discount the political boldness of the Obama administration's proposal. The mining and energy companies that stand to lose money from the rules will almost certainly take them to court. They will be assailed mercilessly in Congress, where energy corporations have good friends and where a big chunk of the Republican Party does not believe in the science of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not to minimize the diplomatic obstacles to a deal on how to share the burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is certainly not to minimize the technological challenge. The most efficient mitigation paths evaluated by the I.P.C.C. rely on the deployment of technologies that don't really exist yet on the scale needed. For instance, in the absence of large-scale carbon capture and storage, the economic cost of staying below the 2-degree limit would more than double.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Earth doesn't care about any of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes all this dithering so agonizing is that staying under the 2-degree ceiling would be surprisingly affordable, if the world started now to make reasonable emission cuts, while investing in developing the future technologies that could largely replace fossil fuels by the end of the century. According to the I.P.C.C report, the effort would slow the growth in the world's annual consumption by no more than 0.14 percentage points, a tiny portion of the typical 3 to 4 percent annual rise in global output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Professor Jackson's tough calculus may be easier to solve than he expected. Based on the most recent I.P.C.C. report, the decline in carbon intensity required to achieve his egalitarian growth target by midcentury without breaching the 2-degree ceiling could be less than half of what he estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet to make progress one must first take the road. Baby steps will not take the world where we need to go.</SPAN></P>

The discussion was spurred by President Obama's announcement of Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut emissions rates from the nation's power plants 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Followers of @TheCaucus Twitter account asked about a variety of issues, including the politics and timing of the rule, its effect on coal-producing states, the implications of the regulations for global negotiations on climate&nbsp;change, and more.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Obama to Take Action to Slash Coal Pollution'' (front page, June 2):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Chamber of Congress, the coal industry, coal-state Democrats and Republican members of Congress are objecting to new environmental rules, claiming that they will be too expensive, disruptive or difficult to achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country has become great because of individuals and groups -- from the founding of our nation to great scientific discoveries to the founding of successful businesses -- who have solved seemingly insurmountable problems. Are opponents of this plan saying we can no longer solve large and intractable problems that will affect human and nonhuman life for generations to come?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of us concerned about the environment do not believe that and are confident that with concerted effort, we can find a way to be the world leader in protecting and preserving our environment while growing our economy. Although the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes that a potential 0.3 percent decrease in the gross domestic product is too high a cost to pay to protect planet Earth, what will its members be willing to pay to ameliorate the environmental destruction that we are already witnessing?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDWIN ANDREWS Malden, Mass., June 2, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a resident of Indiana, a coal state, I applaud the Obama administration's proposed regulations to cut carbon pollution from power plants, and I am frustrated that even Indiana's Democratic senator, Joe Donnelly, wrote to the president to urge that he reconsider the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to climate&nbsp;change, no state is an island, free to continue its carbon pollution. As an agricultural state, Indiana will suffer reduced yields of corn and soybeans as a result of climate&nbsp;change. As an industrial state, it must shift to clean and efficient energy. The longer it delays, the greater its vulnerability to drastic change in a climate catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal-state officials should join Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Ind., and take the lead in climate-friendly adaptation, attracting new industries and good jobs. They should also support a carbon fee and dividend, putting a realistic price on carbon and spurring clean energy and smart conservation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''A Price Tag on Carbon as a Climate Rescue Plan'' (''The Big Fix'' series, front page, May 30):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every offset awarded under California's cap-and-trade system to a rural dairy in Wisconsin, there is pollution allowed that would have been required to be reduced by the ultimate offset purchaser. And that purchaser is often a California refinery in an urban area near thousands of people disproportionately low-income and of color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California seems to assume in the case of dairies that they would have never installed methane capture even though there is money to be made from generating electricity and ample supportive federal programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At best, cap-and-trade as practiced in California can lead to environmental injustice; at worst, emission reductions are a mirage, as they would have happened anyway.</SPAN></P>

''A Price Tag on Carbon as a Climate Rescue Plan'' laid out some of the creative options being tried across the globe to price carbon emissions in order to reduce them. It is exciting to see how much experimentation is going on, and when we find something that works, we should expand it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we shouldn't overlook the value of an option that exists right now in every home, in every business, in every government building: energy efficiency. Investment in energy efficiency is the single most cost-effective way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that we continue to pump into the atmosphere. Energy efficiency also lowers energy bills, and those savings can be reinvested to grow jobs and profits. We have not even come close to exploiting all the opportunities that exist to reduce our energy waste today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weatherization, LED lighting upgrades and high-efficiency air-conditioners may not sound sexy, but to the climate, they are a veritable Brad Pitt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has laid out his legacy on one of the issues that will define the world long after his brief term in power is over. His move to use the Environmental Protection Agency to cap carbon emissions is his boldest effort to circumvent the congressional stalemate using his constitutional powers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is one of the trickiest issues facing any leader. A long-term problem manifesting itself first in the poorest regions of the world, it is one that will only make serious inroads into developed economies long after a current politician's time in office is spent. And it comes up against vested and highly profitable interests - party donors and pension funds. No wonder Obama was initially reluctant to take this on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been burned on this issue before - along with dozens of other world leaders, he attended the Copenhagen climate&nbsp;change conference in 2009, but despite reaching the most effective international agreement that the world had seen on climate&nbsp;change, that summit was widely jeered in the media. He forged an alliance with developing countries including China and India, but that fell apart in subsequent rounds of fractious talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the world was finally able to judge where Obama hopes to take his country. He laid out what was lauded as a &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;historic&quot; vision that - if it is passed - will drastically reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. The response from experts was positive. Lord Stern, author of the 2005 review of the economics of climate&nbsp;change, said: &quot;These plans should help the US achieve its target of reducing annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 17% by 2020, compared with 2005. This represents real leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvo de Boer, former United Nations climate chief, told the Guardian: &quot;It's essential to get the US and China aligned (on climate&nbsp;change) as that is what will make the real difference.&quot; He was hopeful that Obama's stance would make that a reality. Beijing has its own plans for cutting emissions, partly in response to the air pollution crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In little more than a year's time, this wrangling will become very important: world governments have set a deadline of the end of 2015, at a meeting in Paris, to draft a new global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and halt dangerous climate&nbsp;change. This matters. Where China places itself on this potential treaty will be of vital importance. Europe is certainly behind Obama - one Brussels insider told the Guardian the US and the EU were finally joining forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lined up against Obama, Russia is likely to oppose agreements in international forums, as it has done in the past, as is Australia, while the votes of most developing countries are up for grabs. But the biggest hurdle Obama has to face will not be from his peers in other capitals. The opposition to his moves will come from the Republican party and even from his own side. Despite opinion polls that consistently show Americans are concerned about global warming, the forces of climate denial will oppose any curbs on their power to emit carbon dioxide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they have a lot of money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration unveiled historic environment rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 30% yesterday, spurring prospects for a global deal to end climate&nbsp;change but setting up an epic battle over the environment in this year's mid-term elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, represent the first time Barack Obama, or any other president, has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power plants - the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPA said the regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, would &quot;fight climate&nbsp;change while supplying America with reliable and affordable power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said: &quot;The EPA is delivering on a vital piece of President Obama's climate action plan by proposing a clean power plan that will cut harmful carbon pollution from our largest source - power plants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped. America is a third of the way towards meeting the national average of a 30% cut in emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, reaction from environmental groups to the new power plant rules ranged from &quot;momentous&quot; to &quot;historic&quot;. Al Gore said the new rules were &quot;the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said: &quot;Today the president made good on his promise to American families that his administration would tackle the climate crisis, and clean up the way we power our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an initiative organised by Ceres, the green investor network, 128 companies and 49 investors managing $800bn (&pound;478bn) in assets sent letters to the White House and leaders of both parties in Congress supporting the new rules as &quot;a critical step&quot; to dealing with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a lobby group for the coal industry - which will be hit hardest by the new rules - said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. &quot;If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration, for all intents and purposes, is creating America's next energy crisis,&quot; the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had initially sought to deal with climate&nbsp;change through Congress. But after that effort collapsed, and with Republicans in Congress uniformly opposed to cutting carbon emissions - or even acknowledging climate&nbsp;change was occurring - Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her announcement yesterday, McCarthy hit back at criticism from industry and conservative groups that the rules will lead to power outages or higher electricity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics say that energy bills will skyrocket. Well, they're wrong,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCarthy argued the new rules would result in pollution savings that amount to &quot;double what every power plant in America generated in the way of pollution in 2012&quot;. The result, she said, would be lower medical bills and fewer trips to the emergency rooms, especially for kids with asthma and the elderly and infirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCarthy says the plan &quot;is also about environmental justice&quot; because &quot;lower-income families and communities of colour are hardest-hit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants had been falling since 2005, because of the economic downturn and because of the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg New Energy Finance said the power industry was already about a third of the way towards the 30% goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But emissions crept up last year and again in the first months of 2014, and the regulations would put America on course for long term and lasting cuts to carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said: &quot;These standards send a powerful message around the world that it's time to face the global threat of climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules could affect 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA will set individual targets for each state, taking into account their energy mix. States have until 2016 to come up with a strategy for meeting the targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the EPA rules will not come into force in all states until 2020, according to one individual briefed on the plan.</SPAN></P>

Beijing has its own plans for cutting emissions, partly in response to the air pollution crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In little more than a year's time, this wrangling will become very important: world governments have set a deadline of the end of 2015, at a meeting in Paris, to draft a new global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and halt dangerous climate&nbsp;change. This matters. Where China places itself on this potential treaty will be of vital importance. Europe is certainly behind Obama - one Brussels insider told the Guardian the US and the EU were finally joining forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lined up against Obama, Russia is likely to oppose agreements in international forums, as it has done in the past, as is Australia, while the votes of most developing countries are up for grabs. But the biggest hurdle Obama has to face will not be from his peers in other capitals. The opposition to his moves will come from the Republican party and even from his own side. Despite opinion polls that consistently show Americans are concerned about global warming, the forces of climate denial will oppose any curbs on their power to emit carbon dioxide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they have a lot of money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration unveiled historic environment rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 30% yesterday, spurring prospects for a global deal to end climate&nbsp;change but setting up an epic battle over the environment in this year's mid-term elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, represent the first time Barack Obama, or any president, has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power plants - the largest single source of CO2 emissions. The EPA said the regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, would &quot;fight climate&nbsp;change while supplying America with reliable and affordable power&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in his first public comments on the new rules, urged supporters to ignore the &quot;naysayers&quot; and &quot;misinformation&quot;. &quot;This is something that is important for all of us, as parents, as grandparents, as citizens, as folks who care about the health of our families and also want to make sure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space that we're a part of,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said: &quot;The EPA is delivering on a vital piece of President Obama's climate action plan by proposing a clean power plan that will cut harmful carbon pollution from our largest source - power plants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped. Even so, reaction to the new power plant rules ranged from &quot;momentous&quot; to &quot;historic&quot;. Al Gore said the new rules were &quot;the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said: &quot;Today the president made good on his promise to American families that his administration would tackle the climate crisis, and clean up and modernise the way we power our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an initiative organised by Ceres, the green investor network, 128 companies and 49 investors sent letters to the White House and leaders of both parties in Congress hailing the rules as &quot;a critical step&quot; towards dealing with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a lobby group for the coal industry - which will be hit hardest by the new rules - said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. &quot;If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration, for all intents and purposes, is creating America's next energy crisis,&quot; the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had sought to deal with climate&nbsp;change through Congress. But after that effort collapsed, and with Republicans in Congress uniformly opposed to cutting carbon emissions, Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her announcement yesterday, McCarthy hit back at criticism from industry and conservative groups that the rules will lead to power outages and higher electricity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Critics say that energy bills will skyrocket. Well, they're wrong,&quot; she said. McCarthy argued that the new rules would result in pollution savings that amount to &quot;double the pollution every power plant in America generated in 2012&quot;. The result, she said, would be lower medical bills and fewer trips to the emergency rooms, especially for asthma sufferers and the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCarthy said the plan was &quot;also about environmental justice&quot; because &quot;lower-income families and communities of colour are hardest-hit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate&nbsp;change. Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants had been falling since 2005, because of the economic downturn and because of the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg New Energy Finance said the power industry was already about a third of the way towards the 30% goal. But emissions crept up last year and again in the first months of 2014, and the regulations would put America on course for long-term and lasting cuts to carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said: &quot;These standards send a powerful message around the world that it's time to face the global threat of climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules could affect 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA will set individual targets for each state, taking into account their energy mix. States have until 2016 to come up with their strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the EPA rules will not come into force in all states until 2020, according to one individual briefed on the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In numbers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimated fall in carbon pollution from power plants by 2030 if the measures are successfully implemented</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">128</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of companies who have written to the White House supporting the regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,600</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of power plants that could be affected by the EPA rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is not just about disappearing polar bears and melting ice caps,' said the EPA's Gina McCarthy. 'This is about protecting our health and protecting our homes'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- Enormous amounts of capital investment -- up to $2.5 trillion a year -- will be needed to supply the world's energy needs through 2035, according to a report released Monday by the International Energy Agency, the intergovernmental organization based in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of $40 trillion would go to developing and maintaining energy supplies, with $8 trillion more being spent on energy efficiency, the organization said in the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even that amount of investment would not eliminate many of the issues the industry faces. In fact, they could grow worse over the next two decades, according to the I.E.A., which was established in 1974 to promote energy security after the oil embargo by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The I.E.A. report foresees what could be an erosion of the bargaining power of consumers. For instance, the organization predicts that the surge in supplies of oil and gas from shale rock in North America and elsewhere that have reduced the leverage of oil-producing countries are likely to ''run out of steam in the 2020s.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, that would put Middle East producers like Saudi Arabia, which dominate OPEC, back in the driver's seat. And it is not clear that these countries will invest in new sources of supply in a timely way, creating the risk of a rise in oil prices of $15 a barrel by 2025, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency also warns that Europe, where the energy crystal ball is particularly cloudy, is not providing power companies and other investors with sufficient incentive to invest in new electric power facilities. ''If this situation persists, the reliability of European electricity supply will be put at risk,'' the energy agency warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says it foresees an evolution of the energy industry that ''falls well short'' of what is needed to put the brakes on carbon emissions that are widely blamed for climate&nbsp;change. The organization says that policies and market signals are not strong enough to encourage sufficient investment in low-carbon sources and energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some analysts say the agency may be too pessimistic. For instance, the $6 trillion the agency predicts will be spent over the next two decades on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power is small compared with the $23 trillion forecast for fossil fuels but still a big number that is likely to encourage investors in low-carbon sources, says Samantha Smith, head of global climate&nbsp;change and energy at WWF, an environmental group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Energy Agency has ''been pretty bad at estimating the speed and scale of renewables,'' Ms. Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is holding out hope of a breakthrough at the United Nations climate conference in Paris in 2015 that can somehow shift huge amounts of investment toward renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, and to energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of proposed regulations meant to curb emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 are likely to add momentum to the effort to combat climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This of course sends a positive signal ahead of the Paris conference to finalize a new global climate agreement next year,'' Connie Hedegaard, the top European official on climate&nbsp;change, said in a statement on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forecasting in the energy industry is far from foolproof. To take one example, few if any analysts predicted the huge rise in North American oil and gas production that has occurred in recent years. The energy industry itself invested heavily in facilities to process imports of liquefied natural gas. Now some of those installations are being refitted to serve as export terminals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS -- When the leaders of the Group of 7 meet this week in Brussels, they will have plenty on their plates, not least the crisis in Ukraine and the energy security issues it raises. If history is any guide, they will pay little more than lip service to a subject where international leadership is needed: climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperation on halting rising global temperatures has been scant since the 2009 debacle at the Copenhagen climate conference, and time is short if the next big meeting, in the autumn of 2015 in Paris, is to have a chance for success. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, is so concerned that he has asked world leaders to a climate summit meeting this September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The G-7 should be in the lead,'' said Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate&nbsp;Change, the main international body for addressing the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They should be familiarizing themselves with the long-term challenge that science is calling on us to face,'' Ms. Figueres added, namely holding the rise in global temperatures below the benchmark target of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The fact that the United Nations climate conference has been making so little progress suggests that it makes sense to consider other institutions,'' said Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G-7 countries contribute a significant percentage of global emissions, Mr. Stavins noted, and it would be ''a lot easier to work out a deal'' with a handful of nations than with around 180 countries of the United Nations convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been steps at the level of individual nations. On Monday, the Obama administration was to announce it was going over the head of a reluctant Congress to require carbon emissions cuts from America's 600 coal-fired power plants. China said last week that it would take more than five million of the worst polluting cars off its streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist, said the best thing the leaders could do this week would be to cut emissions through a carbon tax or the cap-and-trade system, but that doing so was not politically feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's nothing the G-7 can do to affect the domestic U.S. climate deniers or the carbon-intensive industry lobby,'' said Mr. Stiglitz, who served as a lead author for the International Panel for Climate Control's 1995 report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress, fearing a loss of competitiveness for American corporations, has been unwilling to back any agreement that doesn't require all nations to shoulder an equal burden, he said. But China and many developing nations argue that the countries that have produced most of the man-made greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere should bear most of the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the stalemate, he said, it would be a major step forward if the G-7 could agree on the necessity of enforcement action for whatever deal is finally reached, through trade sanctions against countries that fail to meet the limits: ''They'd be saying that this is a global problem and there won't be any global free riders.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Leinen, a German member of the European Parliament's climate committee, said the biggest priority for the G-7 should be to provide promised financing for the Green Climate Fund, agreed on at Copenhagen, to help poor countries embrace low-carbon energy and adapt to a warming climate. That fund was supposed to have gotten off to a quick start, with $10 billion annually to operate from 2010 to 2012. ''It's an empty box now,'' Mr. Leinen, a Social Democrat, said. ''There's no money in it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Adow, climate policy adviser for Christian Aid, a nonprofit development organization, said the G-7 could give the global climate negotiations ''a dramatic boost by living up to the spirit of the climate convention.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group combines most of the countries ''with the greatest emissions and the greatest wealth,'' he said. ''If they raised their pledges for emissions cuts and finance for helping the poor who desperately need it to survive, that would provide a huge injection of trust into the negotiations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the most important thing the G-7 could do would be ''to give a clear signal'' that they planned to put serious emissions cuts on the table next year in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the G-7 don't do it, how can you ask China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea to come forward with targets for the next round?'' he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Barrett, a professor of natural resource economics at Columbia University, said another approach would be to act on a relatively modest objective to demonstrate that global leaders actually can cooperate on global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One candidate, he said, would be to strongly back a proposal, championed by the United States and others, to assign a type of refrigerant known as hydrofluorocarbons -- among the most potent of the man-made greenhouse gases -- to the Montreal Protocol, the agreement that was created to end the use of gases that deplete the ozone layer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the failed Kyoto Protocol for combating climate&nbsp;change, the Montreal treaty includes an enforcement mechanism, in the form of trade sanctions, and has been used to phase out nearly 100 dangerous gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Montreal Protocol didn't set out to protect the climate, but it has been very successful,'' Mr. Barrett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, said by e-mail that for the G-7 to help galvanize action, it needed ultimately to embrace a positive message. ''It is critical to emphasize the hope of taking action, not the despair of doing nothing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have the technology to transition to a low-carbon economy,'' Mr. Pachauri said, ''and the pathways along which we can move toward that goal. We can make that transition without imposing an unacceptable burden on the global economy.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following my recent rant about misused hyphens, here's a quick look at another much-abused punctuation mark: the comma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precision in such matters may seem like a small detail. But a misplaced or misused comma invariably makes a sentence seem slipshod. Even under deadline pressure, getting the small things right lends polish and precision to our prose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few recent lapses:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We needed another comma, after &quot;teams,&quot; to set off the relative clause. Without it, the sentence is almost unreadable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Dr. Seung is continuing that work at Princeton, commuting, for the time being from Manhattan, where he lives with his wife and young son as they wait for work to be finished on their house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commas don't separate the thoughts properly here; &quot;for the time being&quot; seems to refer to &quot;from Manhattan&quot; rather than to &quot;commuting.&quot; One solution is to eliminate the comma after &quot;commuting&quot;: &quot;is continuing that work at Princeton, commuting for the time being from Manhattan, where he lives with his wife ...&quot; Or we could add a comma after &quot;being&quot; to set off the phrase &quot;for the time being.&quot; In that case, though, change to a dash after &quot;Princeton&quot; to avoid a bewildering pileup: &quot;continuing that work at Princeton - commuting, for the time being, from Manhattan, where he lives with his wife ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Stress Test&quot; provides an intimate take on the financial crisis, and in this respect stands as a gripping, if subjective bookend to already published accounts, like the journalist David Wessel's riveting chronicle &quot;In Fed We Trust&quot; and the economist Alan S. Blinder's lucid &quot;After the Music Stopped.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commas often work in pairs to set off a parenthetical phrase. Sometimes it's possible to eliminate both such commas, but you can't eliminate one and leave the other. Make it &quot;a gripping, if subjective, bookend&quot; or &quot;a gripping if subjective bookend.&quot; (It's a separate question whether &quot;subjective bookend&quot; is a distractingly mixed metaphor.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But just because the bank will give you a mortgage, doesn't mean a co-op board will accept so little cash on the table. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Lots of places do it, you just have to look,&quot; said Josh Koppel, the president of HSC Management. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first sentence, there shouldn't be a comma after &quot;mortgage.&quot; It improperly severs the subject of the sentence (the subordinate clause &quot;because the bank will give you a mortgage&quot;) from the predicate (&quot;doesn't mean&quot;). (Over all, the construction is ramshackle, and we should probably have started over. Perhaps something like &quot;Even if the bank will give you a mortgage, the co-op board may not accept ...&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second sentence has the flaw sometimes called a &quot;comma splice&quot; - that is, a comma separating two independent clauses, where we should use a period, semicolon or some other connector. (In this case, since it's a quote, we could put the attribution after the first clause.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The planned projects that would snake east and west as well as south, could break the virtual United States monopoly market for Canadian oil exports, and enable oil sands production to climb by more than 25 percent in the next decade even if the Keystone pipeline is ultimately blocked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We needed another comma, after &quot;projects,&quot; to set off the relative clause. And since the clause is nonrestrictive - that is, it supplies additional information but is not essential to the meaning - the relative pronoun should be &quot;which,&quot; not &quot;that&quot;: &quot;The planned projects, which would snake east and west as well as south, could break ...&quot; (In any case, the sentence is too long and convoluted; pare it down or break it up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> And More on Hyphens </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we're discussing pesky punctuation, here are some additional hyphen mishaps from recent editions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His newest book, &quot;Another Great Day at Sea: Life Aboard the USS George H. W. Bush,&quot; recounts two weeks he spent embedded on an American aircraft carrier, a life for which he was almost comically ill-suited. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No hyphen is needed when a modifier like this follows the verb. Here's what The Times's stylebook says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ill(-). Hyphenate a compound formed with ill only when it serves as an adjective before a noun: ill-advised, ill-conceived, ill-considered, ill-defined, ill-equipped, ill-fated, ill-gotten, ill-humored, ill-looking, ill-mannered, ill-natured, ill-prepared, ill-spent, ill-starred, ill-suited, ill-tempered, ill-timed, ill-treated, ill-used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hyphen is not used when the words follow the nouns they modify: The plan was ill timed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Center for Naval Analyses Military Advisory Board found that climate change-induced drought in the Middle East and Africa is leading to conflicts over food and water and escalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent clashes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This modifying phrase needs two hyphens to hold it together and make it clear: &quot;climate-change-induced drought.&quot; Or recast to avoid the compound modifier, e.g. &quot;drought induced by climate change in the Middle East and Africa is leading ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bowing to pressure from religious hard-liners in 1974, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's otherwise-secular prime minister, changed the Constitution to discriminate against Ahmadis, who are forbidden to describe themselves as Muslims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no need for a hyphen here, any more than we would write &quot;the very-hungry caterpillar.&quot; It's simply an adverb (otherwise) modifying an adjective (secular).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Klinsmann had openly questioned whether Donovan's desire, commitment and skill had ebbed to the point that less-experienced forwards like Chris Wondolowski and Aron Johannsson deserved instead to be named to the World Cup team along with Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, too, the hyphen is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In a Word </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even before that, relations between the retailer and the publisher have been tense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We needed the pluperfect tense: &quot;But even before that, relations ... had been tense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark Putnam has convinced a Democratic political candidate to swim the Hudson River in February (Mayor Steven Fulop of Jersey City). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stylebook says this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> convince, persuade. Convince should be followed by an of phrase or a that clause: She convinced the teacher of her ability; She convinced her sister that it was too late. But convince cannot be followed by a to phrase; in such a case, persuade is required: He persuaded his sister to take the day off. (Persuade is more versatile than convince, and can be followed by any of the three constructions.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Kessler wrote that he had indicated a &quot;continued desire to refuse to eat and/or drink&quot; since she forbid the military to force-feed him a week ago, and that his condition was &quot;swiftly deteriorating.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past tense of &quot;forbid&quot; is &quot;forbade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comes at a time when the museum world has become more competitive and others are upping their game, namely the Museum of Modern Art, which recently announced a major renovation, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, which will soon move to a snazzy, hip new home downtown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No reason for the slang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON - President Obama is expected to announce on Monday an Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon pollution from the nation's fleet of 600 coal-fired power plants, in a speech that government analysts in Beijing, Brussels and beyond will scrutinize to determine how serious the president is about fighting global warming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fleet describes a group of ships or other vehicles; it's odd to use it about power plants. The phrase could easily be deleted - and the overstuffed sentence would have benefited from some trimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourteen months later, she is weighing scholarship offers from two colleges with premiere rugby teams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make it &quot;premier&quot; rugby teams. The stylebook says this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> premier, premiere. Premier means first in rank or importance, or earliest. Premiere means first performance or showing. As a verb (the show premiered or the orchestra premiered the piece), the word is jargon, to be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he rarely sounds tougher and more candid than when he's blaming his sins on his predecessors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And another stylebook reminder:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blame (v.). Use this construction: The rescuers blamed the weather for the wreck. Do not use blame on: The rescuers blamed the wreck on the weather. Though dictionaries accept both usages, the more traditional has logic on its side: Blame the cause, never the effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, at 97, a motorized chair carries Merullo and his wife up and down their stairs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dangler; the chair is not 97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our per capita incarceration rate is seven times greater than France's, 14 times greater than Japan's and 24 times greater than India's. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More from The Times's stylebook:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> times less, times more. Writers who speak of three times more or three times faster often mean &quot;multiplied by 3,&quot; but precise readers are likely to understand the meaning as &quot;multiplied by 4&quot;: the original quantity or speed, plus three more times. For clarity, avoid times more, times faster, times bigger, etc. Write four times as much (or as fast, etc.). And do not write times less or times smaller (or things like times as thin or times as short). A quantity can decrease only one time before disappearing, and then there is nothing left to decrease further. Make it one-third as much (or as tall, or as fast).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when it could not put forward a viable proposal to run the hospital, SUNY moved onto Peebles, the second-ranked bidder, which proposes to lease some of the property for medical uses, including an emergency room to be run by the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, a chemotherapy clinic and a clinic for the poor, possibly to be located off-site in nearby Red Hook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On&quot; is an adverb modifying &quot;moved,&quot; so this should be two separate words: &quot;SUNY moved on to Peebles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But reports of the slur, which was overheard by another diner at a restaurant in March, shone a harsh light on this small resort town of 6,000 on the eastern shore of Lake Winnipesaukee, just as the promise of summer was bringing it back to life. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to Oregon, judges in seven states - Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Virginia - have had their laws or constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage struck down in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This says the judges had their laws struck down - not what we meant. Remove the words &quot;judges in,&quot; or recast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new rules passed by Republican legislatures require that doctors performing abortions must have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a provision likely to shut down many abortion clinics across the region. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While living in Mexico City in 1985, Ms. Kimes and her husband were arrested on slavery charges after several of their maids complained to the Mexican authorities that they had been beaten and imprisoned in the Kimes's house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wanted the plural possessive here: Kimeses'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French commentators are scrambling to find just the right words to describe a costly bureaucratic blunder that came to light on Wednesday, thanks to some digging by the satirical weekly Le Canard Ench&acirc;in&eacute;. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that it has delayed and is revamping new rules intended to curb political activity by tax-exempt groups and that were proposed after the agency was accused last year of targeting Tea Party groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;and&quot; doesn't belong here. Also, sequence of tenses would require past tenses after &quot;said&quot;: &quot;it had delayed and was revamping ...&quot; More broadly, this is yet another overstuffed and convoluted sentence that should have been simplified and straightened out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Home page summary] Helen McKendry's mother, Jean McConville, was taken by members of the Irish Republican Army and killed 42 years ago. Now she is speaking with the police and suing Sinn Fein. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Despite some initial reports, China has not announced a planned cap on greenhouse gas emissions. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BEIJING - Having covered China's stance on global warming since 1988, I've gotten attuned to the need to tread carefully when something is said that feels like a shift in the official position of this greenhouse gas giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ancient Chinese mask-changing dance that I saw here Tuesday night (at a dinner for participants in a meeting on science and sustainable development) came to mind in considering the unraveling of news a few hours earlier of an official Chinese plan for a firm cap on emissions of carbon dioxide, hard on the heels of President Obama's proposed carbon pollution rules for existing American power plants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how things played out. An adviser to the Chinese government on climate&nbsp;change was quoted by Reuters as saying the following at a Beijing climate-policy conference on Tuesday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan, by intensity and an absolute cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comment came from He Jiankun, a professor at Tsinghua and deputy director of China's Expert Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change, speaking at an international forum on market mechanisms for low-carbon development sponsored by Harvard University and Tsinghua University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story quickly pivoted to how significant this would be given the context of President Obama's move and informal climate talks starting on Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, aimed at setting the stage for fresh climate treaty work later this year at the United Nations and in Lima, Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian quickly followed Reuters with &quot;China pledges to limit carbon emissions for first time,&quot; a piece canvassing climate campaigners but offering no reinforcing input from the Chinese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I consulted with The Times's Beijng bureau. Christopher Buckley, a reporter who in 2011 had covered China's emissions plans while with Reuters, spoke with He Jiankun, who told him repeatedly that he did not in any way speak for the government, or the full expert climate committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Buckley's translation:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not the case that the Chinese government has made any decision. This is a suggestion from experts, because now they are exploring how emissions can be controlled in the 13th Five Year Plan.... This is a view of experts; that's not saying it's the government's. I'm not a government official and I don't represent the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Reuters reporter told me tonight that a correction was being posted, but not before other newspapers -&nbsp;including USA Today with a piece on China's &quot;emissions pledge&quot;&nbsp;-&nbsp;built on the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other, more recent news coverage has reflected that this isn't China's position, although many experts in Beijing (including at the meeting I'm participating in) foresee an eventual cap and a peak in China's emissions sometime after 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's more from other news outlets. The China News Service, a state-run news agency, also reported on the comments made by Professor He at the Tsinghua-Harvard forum but made no mention of proposals for a quantitative cap on carbon dioxide emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Financial Times posted &quot;China climate adviser urges emissions cap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling that all energy forecasts need to be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism, best guesses for a peak in China's greenhouse gas emissions tend to center on the 2030s, as reflected in this paper earlier this year in the journal Energy Policy: &quot;Peak energy consumption and CO2 emissions in China.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the abstract:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China is in the processes of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on the Kaya identity [a formula drawing on economic activity, energy use and other factors to determine a country's greenhouse-gas impact], this paper proposes an analytical framework for various energy scenarios that explicitly simulates China[#x5f3]s economic development, with a prospective consideration on the impacts of urbanization and income distribution. With the framework, China[#x5f3]s 2050 energy consumption and associated CO2 reduction scenarios are constructed. Main findings are: (1) energy consumption will peak at 5200-5400 million tons coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2035-2040; (2) CO2 emissions will peak at 9200-9400milliontons (Mt) in 2030-2035, whilst it can be potentially reduced by 200-300Mt; (3) China[#x5f3]s per capita energy consumption and per capita CO2 emission are projected to peak at 4tce and 6.8t respectively in 2020-2030, soon after China steps into the high income group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things could potentially speed up, as some have noted, but there are limits to the pace at which China can develop enough cleaner energy alternatives to cut back on coal burning. Professor He noted this in the Reuters article:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said China's greenhouse gas emissions would only peak in 2030, at around 11 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent. Its emissions currently stand at around 7-9.5 billion tonnes. But He said that would depend on China achieving a real reduction in coal consumption from sometime around 2020 or 2025, and on the nation meeting its target of having 150-200 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity by 2030. The share of non-fossil fuels in China's energy mix would reach 20 to 25 percent in 2030, He added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an emissions peak and rough timeline are clearer, you can be sure a cap will be announced - but only when the trajectories are already in place to make it a sure bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're already locked in for substantial human-driven climate&nbsp;change, but the intensifying focus on a post-fossil future in both China and the United States points to a real prospect that much of the world's remaining coal will stay in the ground in the end.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flash flooding in summer is likely to become much more frequent across the UK as a result of climate&nbsp;change, with potentially devastating results in vulnerable areas, according to new research.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, published last night in the peer-review journal Nature Climate&nbsp;Change, is the first to draw a direct link between climate&nbsp;change and an increase in summer downpours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research, a result of a collaboration between the Met Office and Newcastle University, used climate&nbsp;change computer models and standard weather prediction models of the type used for short-term weather forecasts. It found that summers would be drier overall, but punctuated by more extreme downpours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These can have a much worse effect than the steady rainfall typical of winter, because the dry land is less capable of absorbing water, and when too much falls in a short period it runs off, causing flash floods of the type that struck Boscastle in 2004, one of the worst examples of sudden localised flooding in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether any given area is subject to flash flooding will depend heavily on its topography, such as the proximity of uplands and rivers, but vulnerable areas are likely to experience far more incidents than they did in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not possible to say exactly how many more floods are likely, but the researchers said instances of particularly heavy summer rainfall - defined as more than 28mm in an hour - would be about five times more probable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Kendon of the Met Office, the lead author of the study, said that the research was groundbreaking in using a high-resolution weather forecasting model to translate the likely effects of climate&nbsp;change into a detailed prediction of future UK summer weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until now, we haven't been able to do it in this way,&quot; she said. &quot;This should help people to understand what is likely to happen in the summer in future. It's very important that we've detected this signal for heavier downpours in the UK. It's now for policymakers to decide what to do about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14 colleges demand university shouldn't invest in companies that are fuelling the climate crisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students and dons at 14 Oxford collegeshave urged the university to purge its &pound;3.3bn endowment fund of all investments in fossil fuel companies. The move follows 64 Oxford professors and other senior academics signing an open letter and a petition by over 800 students, staff and alumni.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Oxford, with an endowment fund of around &pound;3.8bn, is believed to have the largest investments in fossil fuel companies of any UK university. It is now consulting business, academics and others on whether it should follow some US universities which have comitted to sell off their fossil fuel investments. The results of the Oxford consultation will be considered by the university's socially responsible investment review committee in July and a formal recommendation made to the university council later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their open letter, academics argue that Oxford has a &quot;responsibility to show leadership in tackling one of the greatest challenges we as a society currently face.&quot; Signatories to the letter include Lord Robert May, former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, Lesley Gray, professor of atmospheric physics, and Gordon Clark, current director of Oxford University's Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We at Oxford like to claim the mantle of intellectual leadership,&quot; said Henry Shue, professor of politics and international relations. &quot;Here is our opportunity to display genuine leadership when it counts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can only burn 20% of the carbon in the proven fossil fuel reserves. We'll have reached that limit in 16 years at present rates of consumption. Now we have a carbon bubble, of unreal value. It is too risky to own shares in this bubble. It has to burst, and will burst if we are sane and want to avoid dangerous climate&nbsp;change,&quot; said Brenda Boardman, emeritus Oxford fellow at the Environmental Change Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to student pressure group People and Planet, 46 UK universities are now being pressed by their staff, students and alumni to divest themselves of about &pound;5.2bn in fossil fuel investments. Edinburgh and Glasgow universities are expected to make a decision later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moves by UK universities follow an escalating global campaign to push universities to sell off their holdings in fossil fuels. Earlier this year 129 Harvard professors accused the world's richest university of a &quot;failure of leadership&quot; on climate&nbsp;change and called on it to purge its nearly $33bn (&pound;20bn) endowment of all holdings in fossil fuel companies. Nine US colleges have so far committed to selling off their stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN and the World Bankhave both endorsed divestment as a way of fighting climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continuing to invest in companies fuelling the climate crisis is not only morally bankrupt but also financially imprudent and Oxford should heed the warnings of its own respected academics. Ultimately, ignoring the growing student-led Fossil Free campaign will put the university on the wrong side of history and damage its hard-earned reputation and its &pound;3.3bn endowment,&quot; said James Farndon, Fossil Free campaign co-ordinator, at People &amp; Planet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiona Harvey: US move brings it closer to Europe and improves chances of getting a global agreement at Paris climate talks in 2015</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Barack Obama has laid out his legacy on one of the issues that will define the world long after his brief term in power is over. He has been frustrated in several other attempts to bring climate&nbsp;change to the fore of US politics, with the demise of cap and trade plans a notable failure, but his move to use the Environmental Protection Agency to cap carbon emissions is his boldest effort yet, trying to circumvent the Congressional stalemate on the issue using his constitutional powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is one of the trickiest issues to face for any leader. A long-term problem manifesting first in the poorest regions of the world, that will only make serious inroads into developed economies long after a current politician's half-life is spent. Vested and highly profitable interests - party donors, indeed, and pension funds - that rely on fossil fuels. Contrarian attacks on the clear science that tells us the world is warming, supported by a sceptic media and believed by millions. . No wonder Obama was initially reluctant to take this on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has been burned on this issue before - along with dozens of other world leaders, he attended the Copenhagen climate&nbsp;change conference in 2009, but despite reaching the most effective international agreement that the world has yet seen on climate&nbsp;change, that summit was widely jeered in the media. He forged an alliance with developing countries including China and India, but that fell apart in subsequent rounds of fractious talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the world was finally able to judge where President Obama hopes to take his country. He laid out what was lauded as a &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;historic&quot; vision that - if it is passed - will reduce US greenhouse gas emissions drastically. The response from climate experts was overwhelmingly positive. Lord Stern, author of the 2005 review of the economics of climate&nbsp;change, said: &quot;These new plans should help the US achieve its target of reducing annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 17% by 2020, compared with 2005. This represents real leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yvo de Boer, former United Nations climate chief, told the Guardian: &quot;It's essential to get the US and China aligned [on climate&nbsp;change] as that is what will make the real difference.&quot; He was hopeful that President Obama's stance would make that a reality. Beijing has not yet officially responded to President Obama's announcement, but has its own plans for cutting emissions, partly in response to the air pollution crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In little more than a year's time, this wrangling will become very important: world governments have set themselves a deadline of the end of 2015, at a meeting in Paris, to draft a new global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and halt dangerous climate&nbsp;change. This matters. Where China places itself on this potential treaty will be of vital importance. Europe is certainly behind Obama - one Brussels insider told the Guardian the US and the EU were finally joining forces. Lined up against him, Russia is likely to oppose agreements in international forums, as it has done in the past, as is Australia, while the votes of most developing countries are still up for grabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the biggest hurdle President Obama has to face will not be from his peers in other capitals. The opposition to his historic moves will come from the Republican party, within the toxic world of US politics, and even from his own side. Despite opinion polls that consistently show Americans are concerned about global warming, the forces of climate denial will still do their utmost to oppose any curbs on their power to emit carbon dioxide. And they have a lot of money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of his first year in office, President Obama flew to Copenhagen and made a big promise: that the United States would cut its greenhouse gas emissions substantially by 2020 -- a bold and risky pledge that hinged on a balky Congress to make it possible. His efforts became bogged down within months, and Mr. Obama's pledge to the rest of the world soon looked like a pipe dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. Obama is planning to bypass Congress and take one of the biggest steps any American president has ever taken on climate&nbsp;change, proposing new rules to cut emissions at power plants. Yet, by itself, the president's plan will barely nudge the global emissions that scientists say are threatening the welfare of future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Is it enough to stop climate&nbsp;change? No,'' said Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental think tank in Oakland, Calif. ''No political leader in the world has a serious agenda to do that.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after Mr. Obama's inability to get his major climate&nbsp;change proposal through Congress in 2010, fate has intervened to help him toward his goal. Thanks partly to a surfeit of natural gas that few people saw coming, emissions in the United States have already fallen 10 percent from 2005 levels and are still heading down, even without Mr. Obama's new rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear Mr. Obama's immediate goal is not to solve the emissions problem, but to get the country moving faster in the right direction. The new rule alone offers little hope that the United States and other nations can achieve cuts on a scale required to meet the internationally agreed limit on global warming. But experts say that achieving the pledge Mr. Obama made in Copenhagen -- a 17 percent reduction in the nation's greenhouse gases by 2020, compared with the 2005 level -- would be quite likely, if his plan survives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's effort is aimed not just at charting a new course inside the United States, but at reclaiming for the country the mantle of international leadership in battling climate&nbsp;change. If the policy coaxes more ambitious goals from other countries, experts say it could be a turning point. The test of that will come soon, as world leaders meet in New York in September seeking to make headway on a new global climate treaty. The leaders are supposed to pledge ambitious new emissions targets for their countries by next spring, with a final treaty due in late 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's the first American president to permanently push down the U.S. emissions trajectory and get us within striking distance of the kind of global leadership that will be needed to tackle the problem,'' said Paul Bledsoe, an energy analyst with the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's nations have set a goal to limit the warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above the preindustrial level. If that is to happen, many studies suggest that global emissions need to peak no later than 2020 and then begin to fall. Today, emissions are not falling nearly fast enough in the West, and those reductions are being swamped by a rapid rise in the East. Experts say that a global peak in 2020 is exceedingly unlikely, if not impossible -- and that will be true even if the United States and other nations manage to keep the pledges they made in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well into the 2020s, it will still be technically possible to meet the global warming target, but the longer nations put off taking bold action, the more expensive and disruptive it will be to do so once they finally get serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say Mr. Obama is slowly piecing together a set of policies that may wind up being at least as effective as the law Congress refused to pass in 2010. Until now, his biggest step has been a set of automotive efficiency standards that will eventually require cars sold in the United States to get more than 50 miles to a gallon of gasoline on average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's plan for power plants is not expected to become final for another year, after extensive public comment, and will be subject to lawsuits and a possible attempt in Congress to block it. But in its current form, it will lock in a shift toward natural gas that is already underway in the United States, for economic reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few years, as the technology known as hydraulic fracturing has brought a flood of natural gas to market and driven down the price, utilities have been switching from coal to gas to generate electricity. That lowers emissions because natural gas emits roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal to produce a given amount of power. But natural gas is still a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, raising the question of how the country will wean itself off that fuel in the years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Clean Air Act, the legislation Mr. Obama is relying on to institute his policy, states will have a major role, and they may make widely varying decisions about how to do so. But experts generally expect the policy to lock in the trend of growing national reliance on natural gas, even if the price goes up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Whether President Obama wants to admit it or not, he has definitely declared a war on coal,'' said Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy, a Texas oil and gas company that stands to benefit from the Obama plan. ''The era of coal is coming to an end. We are entering the era of natural gas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, many coal-burning power plants will continue running, possibly for decades, assuming states find ways of offsetting their emissions, such as efficiency upgrades to homes and businesses that could lower overall power demand. But if the plan stands, the coal industry will, at best, face a future of gradually declining market share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest question about Mr. Obama's plan is whether it will rev up the engine of American innovation, producing new technology and economic approaches that make the country's -- and the world's -- climate goals seem more achievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than a decade, people working in the twin centers of American economic ingenuity, Wall Street and Silicon Valley, have been agitating to get going on the climate problem. But they have been stymied by lack of a clear national policy about where the country was headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the nation's technological luminaries, including Bill Gates, have urged Congress to double or triple the country's spending on basic research and development in the energy field. Congress has largely ignored them, and Mr. Obama has no ability on his own to steer that kind of money toward the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some experts said his new plan may at least send a signal to private capital that now is the time to get involved in trying to solve the energy challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Once the rules are in place, then the engineers really are unleashed on the question of, oh, what's the cheapest way to do this?'' said Kevin Kennedy, director of the United States Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute, a think tank. ''American engineers are pretty good at this sort of thing.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday will announce one of the strongest actions ever taken by the United States government to fight climate&nbsp;change, a proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon pollution from the nation's power plants 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, according to people briefed on the plan who spoke anonymously because they had been asked not to reveal details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation takes aim at the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States, the nation's more than 600 coal-fired power plants. If it withstands an expected onslaught of legal and legislative attacks, experts say that it could close hundreds of the plants and also lead, over the course of decades, to systemic changes in the American electricity industry, including transformations in how power is generated and used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also likely to stand as President Obama's last chance to substantially shape domestic policy and as a defining element of his legacy. The president, who failed to push a sweeping climate&nbsp;change bill through Congress in his first term, is now acting on his own by using his executive authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act to issue the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rule, states will be given a wide menu of policy options to achieve the pollution cuts. Rather than immediately shutting down coal plants, states would be allowed to reduce emissions by making changes across their electricity systems -- by installing new wind and solar generation or energy-efficiency technology, and by starting or joining state and regional ''cap and trade'' programs, in which states agree to cap carbon pollution and buy and sell permits to pollute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.P.A. officials have said they hope the flexible approach will allow states to comply with the regulation more easily and cost-effectively, by adopting policies best tailored to regional economies and energy mixes. But industry groups planning to sue to block or delay the rule have said that approach makes the rule more legally vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of the proposed regulation were first reported Sunday afternoon by The Wall Street Journal online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because burning coal is the largest source of the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for trapping heat in the atmosphere and dangerously warming the planet, the rule is expected to have a powerful environmental impact. It comes on top of a regulation Mr. Obama issued in his first term that sharply increased the required fuel economy of vehicles, the second-largest source of carbon pollution in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that the new regulation would set the United States on track to meet its target set forth in a United Nations accord in 2009, when Mr. Obama pledged that the United States would cut its greenhouse gas pollution 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, environmental advocates praised the proposed rule for its breadth and reach while the coal industry attacked it as a symbol of executive overreach that could wreak economic havoc. Republican campaigns plan to use the rule to attack incumbent Democrats in this fall's midterm elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This momentous announcement raises the bar for controlling carbon emissions in the United States,'' said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, a Washington research organization, adding, ''These new standards send a powerful message around the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Segal, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani, which represents coal companies and plans to sue over the rule, wrote in an email, ''Clearly, it is designed to materially damage the ability of conventional energy sources to provide reliable and affordable power, which in turn can inflict serious damage on everything from household budgets to industrial jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a report warning that the rule could lower the gross domestic product by $50 billion annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal to be unveiled Monday will be a draft, open to public comment, and is certain to set off a wave of lobbying from states, industry groups and environmentalists seeking to shape the final version of the rule. While there is no legal deadline for finalizing the regulation, Mr. Obama has directed the E.P.A. to issue the rule by June 2015 so that the administration can begin putting the program in place before he leaves office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nations around the world are closely scrutinizing the climate&nbsp;change rule and its prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of the rule signals that Mr. Obama may be more interested in achieving a legacy-making global deal on climate&nbsp;change than in short-term political concerns. While the rule could make things politically difficult for incumbent Democrats from coal states in November, it could make things easier for American climate&nbsp;change negotiators this fall at the United Nations General Assembly, where governments are expected to hold side meetings intended to forge a global climate&nbsp;change treaty that negotiators hope to have signed by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the long term, the United States has been the world's largest emitter of carbon pollution, but today China is the largest, with India and other developing Asian countries poised to see an explosion in their carbon pollution in the coming years as millions of people join the middle class and begin enjoying cheap coal-fired electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But China and India have resisted American pressure to cut their own carbon pollution because, they have said, the United States has no moral authority to push other nations to cut pollution when it fails to do so at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department climate negotiators hope that by bringing the new E.P.A. rule to the table, they will be able to demonstrate significant action and have fresh leverage to broker a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I fully expect action by the United States to spur others in taking concrete action,'' Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework on Climate&nbsp;Change, said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Environmental Protection Agency is trying to stress the word pollution in explaining its rules for cutting power plant emissions of carbon dioxide. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: Watch on YouTube.]<BR>With the release this morning of the Obama administration's proposed regulations curbing emissions of heat-trapping gases from existing power plants, the battle to shape public attitudes is already in high gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are scurrying to label the move a hidden &quot;national energy tax&quot; and &quot;war on coal&quot; (see the fine NBC online piece titled &quot;Carbon Combat&quot; for more).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big Beltway-oriented green groups are largely hailing the plan, which is no surprise given the close ties between these groups and the administration. (As just one example, take Joe Goffman, the senior E.P.A. official featured in the agency's whiteboard talk on the climate plan above, who has moved twice between the agency and the Environmental Defense Fund.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other climate and energy campaigners see far too weak a plan, with Charles Komanoff of the Carbon Tax Center making this trenchant observationabout how recent progress on emissions (through the surprise shift from coal to gas and rise in energy efficiency) compares to the planned cuts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By calling for only a second round of 15% cuts (355 million tonnes) from 2014 to 2030, the Obama plan in effect takes twice as long (16 years) to cut as much carbon pollution as the country just did (in 8 years, from 2005 to 2013).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To press the case for action, the Obama administration is intensifying a rhetorical shift that's been pushed by climate campaigners for several years - from carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions to &quot;carbon pollution.&quot; The graphic above from the E.P.A. website for the proposed &quot;carbon pollution standards&quot; is a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intent is clear, particularly given how Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and others in the administration are focusing today's message (video here) not only on stemming global warming but also the direct health and smog benefits of shifting from coal burning to cleaner alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;carbon pollution&quot; phrase has been gaining a bit of traction ever since the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the agency had the right to restrict greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, a law originally aimed at more conventional forms of pollution, like the precursors of smog and acid rain. (Check this Google Trends comparison of &quot;carbon pollution&quot; and &quot;greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One technical problem with this approach is that not all carbon-containing molecules have significant heat-trapping properties and not all human-released greenhouse gases contributing to global warming contain carbon (nitrous oxide comes to mind).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's really a side note. The bigger challenge is, of course, that language isn't the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;super wicked&quot; nature of the building greenhouse effect is the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are the impacts of global warming dispersed unevenly around the globe and mostly still backloaded on future generations, but the global human population is heading toward 9 billion people seeking decent lives - a process that, even with substantial work on efficiency, requires enormously expanded access to energy, most of which will still come from fossil fuels for at least decades to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read George Marshall's recent invaluable piece on the other rhetorical tussle of late - between &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; and &quot;global warming&quot; - to learn more about the limits of framing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Huffington Post article on Obama's climate plan, Steve Cohen, the executive director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, lays out why the president's move is creditable, but nowhere near a climate&nbsp;change game changer:&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devoting scarce political capital to the goal of raising the price of fossil fuels is a waste of effort. Without substitutes, their use will grow regardless of price. They are simply too important to regulate; they must be replaced. Energy is deeply connected and imbedded in every aspect of modern life. Fossil fuel energy prices will rise and the growing proportion of GDP devoted to energy could very well dampen economic growth and threaten political stability. Post-industrial nations like ours will reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade and indeed those reductions have already begun. Nevertheless, the vast increases in fossil fuel based energy use in China and India alone virtually guarantee continued global warming. No treaty or policy will reduce the hunger for fossil fuels in those places. Only a lower-priced, reliable and convenient replacement for fossil fuels will make a difference. The argument is that a global climate policy will speed the development of renewables. I see no evidence of that. It could just as easily be ignored, undermining the legitimacy of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A replacement for fossil fuels is essential for ecological, economic and political sustainability and stability. Governments should focus as much human brainpower as we can find to develop and implement renewable energy technology. The goal should be to make fossil fuels irrelevant. Fossil fuels need to become the energy equivalent of the eight-track tape. They need to be driven from the marketplace by a better source of energy. By &quot;better&quot; I mean lower-priced, reliable and less of a threat to our ecosphere. [ Read the rest.]                       </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11:28 A.M. | Gore Expresses Support for Carbon Plan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as a year ago, former Vice President Al Gore was publicly criticizing President Obama's environmental record, characterizing his efforts as all talk and no action, despite Mr. Obama's push to cut emissions from cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Gore, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his advocacy of urgent measures to combat man-made climate&nbsp;change, praised the administration's latest plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's announcement by the Obama administration to reduce our nation's global warming pollution from power plants is the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in the country's history,&quot; he said in statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gore used the moment to take yet another shot at those who play down the effects of climate&nbsp;change and question whether the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is man-made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As with the connection between tobacco and lung cancer, special interests have vehemently denied the linkage between carbon emissions and the climate crisis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These special interests now recognize that change is inevitable, but continue to trot out misleading and false claims to spread confusion and delay action for as long as they can,&quot; he added. &quot;However, it is now clear that further inaction would be extremely dangerous and destructive for America and the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Analysts are predicting that climate&nbsp;change (and related policy uncertainty) could add as much as 10 percent to portfolio-wide risk in the next two decades, putting trillions of dollars of institutional investors' assets at risk. In order to manage this risk, we, as investors, are seeking long-term policies that provide businesses the certainty needed to transition to a clean energy economy,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11:12 A.M. | Coal Advocacy Group Responds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's plan takes direct aim at the nation's 600 coal-fired power plants, collectively the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States - and, not incidentally, the biggest source of electric power generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity came out swinging this morning, calling President Obama's plan &quot;costly,&quot; &quot;misguided&quot; and &quot;devastating&quot; to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration for an intents and purposes is creating America's next energy crisis,&quot; Mike Duncan, the group's president and a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. &quot;These guidelines represent a complete disregard for our country's most vital fuel sources, like American coal, which provides nearly 40 percent of America's power, reliably and affordably,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Duncan warned of rolling blackouts and higher utility bills, particularly for lower-income Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, E.P.A.'s proposed regulations put America's low- and middle-income families most at risk of paying disproportionately more for energy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11:07 A.M. | McCain and Climate&nbsp;Change: A History </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican lawmakers can be counted on to chastise President Obama for his plan to cut carbon pollution from the nation's power plants substantially by 2030. But six years ago, Republicans were backing a proposal by their front-runner and eventual nominee for president, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for a similar plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. McCain sought to distance himself from the deeply unpopular Bush administration, he called for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States to combat climate&nbsp;change, as The New York Times reported at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezra Klein of Vox pointed out this morning that Mr. McCain's plan was even more aggressive than Mr. Obama's, aiming to cut emissions by at least 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The Republican Party, including Mr. McCain's Tea Party-inspired running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, endorsed that plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, still locked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, were proposing an 80 percent cut in the same time frame. Now, as president, Mr. Obama wants to cut emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition to the Obama administration's climate plan was pouring in even before the proposal was unveiled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican leadership did not hesitate to condemn the proposal. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, called the proposal a &quot;dagger in the heart of the American middle class, and to representative democracy itself.&quot; He said that the proposal to cut carbon emissions would mean higher costs, fewer jobs and a less reliable energy grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, used equally forceful rhetoric, calling the plan a &quot;sucker punch&quot; to American families by causing a surge in electricity bills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11:05 A.M. | E.P.A. Makes Case for Change </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Gina McCarthy, made a robust case for acting on climate&nbsp;change. Here are some central quotes from her speech:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change fueled by pollution is supercharging risk.&quot;<BR>&quot;For the sake of our families' health and for our kids' future, we have a moral obligation to act on climate.&quot;<BR>&quot;We'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity.&quot;<BR>&quot;I'm a little tired of people pointing to the polar vortex as a reason not to act on climate. It's the exact opposite. It's a wake-up call.&quot;<BR>&quot;Over four decades, E.P.A. has cut air pollution by 70 percent and the economy has more than tripled. Climate action doesn't actually dull America's competitive edge, it sharpens it.&quot;<BR>&quot;The most costly thing we can do is to do nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ''Buying Insurance Against Climate&nbsp;Change,'' his Economic View column last Sunday, Robert J. Shiller posed the idea of sharing the long-term risks of global warming, via the institutions of insurance and the securities markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such moves will be needed, he said, ''because of the substantial risk that efforts to stop global warming will fail,'' and ''we must encourage private innovation and government support to insure against the devastating financial losses that will result.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The column drew more than 160 comments on nytimes.com. These have been edited and condensed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big long-term risks from climate&nbsp;change are either too predictable (coastal cities submerged/ski resorts with no snow) or too universal (the American Southwest runs out of water/the marine food chain collapses) to lend themselves to insurance solutions. You can insure against uncertainty, but not certainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BILLSETT, MOUNT PLEASANT, SC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shiller does get it. When insurers price insurance they will not sell insurance to lose money. Insurance premiums will be adjusted as the risk varies. That will compel the insured to seek solutions or face ever-increasing premiums as global warming increases. As an analogy, consider how auto insurance premiums led to air bags, seatbelts and shoulder harnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMIROW, PHILA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not just deal with the facts? If you live in a low-lying area move to higher ground; I shouldn't have to pay for your stupidity or the stupidity of the right wing that rejects science and allows it to go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARLSON74, MASSACHUSETTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though insurance policies will eventually be devised to cover some of the costs of climate&nbsp;change, let's keep in mind that the outcome will be suboptimal. By making climate&nbsp;change a ''cost of doing business,'' an insurance approach is less likely to create an incentive for the consumer to behave in a way that produces a socially optimal outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we really need is to directly pass through climate impacts as a fee to actual contributors to climate&nbsp;change, as much as that is feasible through markets or regulatory schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TED, FOREST HILLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think the point was that insurance is the only solution, but that it is part of the larger whole. And it's good to make climate&nbsp;change a cost of doing business, because corporations will have additional incentives to reduce their costs. That, plus a direct pass-through of costs, should go a long way to addressing the issue. At least that part of it caused by corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIG D, DENVER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world that didn't require that even catastrophes must be an opportunity for the wealthy to accumulate additional wealth, we would have mutual assurance organizations, in which both risk and profit are shared by the insured. In fact, government, through the tax mechanism, could serve this precise purpose, even making the funding of insurance progressive to protect the most vulnerable. If only we could believe in it and make it work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRIAN STEWART, MIDDLETOWN, CT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change that causes this kind of damage will materially change the monetary system in a way that insurance will mean almost as little as an icebox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATTORNEY JOHNSON, BERLIN, WI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's good to know that, in the face of an ecological disaster of global proportions, people are still able to make a buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICHAEL, BIRMINGHAM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One should ask what side of the option the critics of the climate-control prognosis are placing their money. That will tell you something about their true convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRIAN WINKEL, CORNWALL NY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your best insurance against climate&nbsp;change is to change your own lifestyle. If you represent a company, change the way the company operates. Treat the Earth with respect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS -- When the police arrested seven students at Washington University in St. Louis recently after a crowd of protesters sought to crash a board of trustees meeting, leaders of the environmental movement were thrilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students were demanding the resignation of one of the board's members: Gregory H. Boyce, the chairman of Peabody Energy Corporation, the nation's largest coal company and one of the most ardent corporate opponents of efforts to address global warming. They also represented the face of a new activism that the nation's largest environmental groups are encouraging to revive a climate-change movement that seemed stalled not so long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like their student confederates, the so-called big green groups are mounting their own climate-change campaign this spring, and it looks nothing like the failed efforts of the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was a scattering of lawyers, lobbyists and policy analysts with the same goal but no agenda has become a united front, leaders of the groups say. Major organizations like the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council have strengthened their political operations and grass-roots networks, and they have raised and spent more money than ever before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members whose activism had been limited mostly to paying their annual dues have been marshaled by the groups for a number of efforts, like demonstrating in Washington, dogging members of Congress on home leave and blitzing the Environmental Protection Agency with emails and letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The national environmental groups said, 'We need to do more in-your-face activism,' '' said Gene Karpinski, the president of the League of Conservation Voters. ''You can't just lobby members of Congress with a poll that says people support you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most striking, perhaps, the groups intend to make global warming an issue in some of this fall's hardest-fought political campaigns -- a calculation that conservatives who say climate&nbsp;change poses no threat have overplayed their hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of the retooled strategy will debut Monday, when the Obama administration will issue a draft regulation sharply limiting emissions of global-warming gases from existing coal-burning power plants. Anticipating furious opposition from congressional Republicans and coal-state Democrats, environmental groups plan to rally support for the regulation using a campaign created by the Climate Action Coalition -- a coordinating body with its own staff and consultants, formed by 10 leading environmental groups and linked to 60 more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created in 2009 during a failed lobbying effort for climate-change legislation, the coalition was ''renovated from bottom to top'' after the 2010 midterm elections to bolster it for continuing climate-change battles, said Wesley Warren, head of the Policy Advocacy Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Most recently the coalition oversaw a campaign, completed in May, that spurred four million people to send comments to the Environmental Protection Agency supporting a proposal to limit emissions from new coal-burning power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new campaign, which will reprise the comment drive, will be backed by millions in advertising on cable television and online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What we've learned is that you have to build out the political infrastructure to support these kinds of actions at every level,'' Mr. Warren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If big green claims to have retaken the offense in the climate-change wars, opponents say they welcome the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The issue most people are most concerned about is jobs, and the policies they are proposing limit job growth and potentially destroy existing jobs,'' said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans' campaign arm. ''It's out of touch with where the American people are.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who calls climate&nbsp;change a hoax, described the groups' campaign as hypocritical, saying the environmentalists accuse their foes of being financed by oil-industry contributions while liberal allies pour tens of millions of dollars into their effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And John Christy, a scientist and climate-change skeptic at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who was a lead author for a 2001 report of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, called the big green groups ideologues. ''It's a strategy that doesn't require any scientific defensibility,'' he said, but ''the real data will eventually win.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are precisely the arguments that the major environmental organizations aim to refute, said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're in a fight to change how our civilization is powered -- that's the crux of the climate-change issue,'' he said. ''The coal and oil and gas companies are fighting the environmental movement very actively, punching with both fists, and to combat that, the environmental movement needs to be strong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which it was not. Such changes were a recognition that the very groups whose grass-roots and political activism spawned the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s had let those strengths atrophy by the time the climate-change battles of the last decade began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During those years, the groups' strategy was rooted in Washington lobbying, and their effort to rally public support was driven mostly by scientists' complaints of an invisible, slow-moving and seemingly distant threat. The approach made the environmental movement an easy target for the energy industry and its ideological allies, which cast doubt on the reliability of climate science and turned global warming into a political wedge issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comprehensive climate-change legislation that had been the overriding goal of the environmental movement died in the Senate in 2010 without reaching a vote. That November, an angry electorate replaced many of the legislation's supporters in Congress with deeply conservative Republicans who opposed climate legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thoroughly drubbed by their foes, big green leaders decided to bury their climate-change strategy, but not before conducting a collective autopsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''After we quickly got through the hand-wringing and finger-pointing,'' said Mr. Karpinski, ''we spent a lot of time saying, 'O.K., what do we need to do to be more powerful?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the reinvigorated activism stems from strategic decisions made after the electoral defeats of 2010. A rejuvenated Climate Action Coalition moved its focus to promoting the federal government's authority to rein in carbon emissions. The National Resources Defense Council, long focused on lawsuits and policy papers, set up an advocacy center that, among other projects, organized Latino climate activism; the group currently runs Latino voter-registration programs with the League of Conservation Voters in 12 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2011, Mr. Brune's Sierra Club had created an Internet team to extend the group's reach. Experimenting with everything from website typefaces to the ''sign'' button on email petitions, the group sharply increased donations to Sierra campaigns and, since September, recruited 100,000 volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, the League of Conservation Voters tested the greens' election strategy, running commercials in the home states of legislators who question a threat from global warming. Polls indicated that favorable ratings of the legislators dropped once voters knew of their views, said David Willett, the league's chief spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's not just people's position on climate&nbsp;change, but what your denials say about you as a person,'' Mr. Willett said. ''It paints you as an extremist and puts you in a category of people that people think of as the fringe -- birthers and that sort of thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2014 election will show whether the same messages that resonate with environmental loyalists also strike a chord with other voters. This time, the big-green strategy is not to make climate&nbsp;change an electoral litmus test -- few voters do that -- but to make it a test of character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, where a rising sea level is becoming a concern, the Natural Resources Defense Council is dispatching local environmentalists to Gov. Rick Scott's public appearances to ask that he explain his plan to address climate&nbsp;change. Mr. Scott's videotaped responses -- the first was ''Goodbye'' -- are sent to the state's news media and to activist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Michigan, where concern is rising over the impact of climate&nbsp;change on the Great Lakes, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Representative Gary Peters, is challenging his Republican opponent, Terri Lynn Land, to say whether she believes human activity causes global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis, the student protesters say the leader of a company that disputes a threat from global warming has no place at an institution where scientists have underscored the seriousness of the problem and administrators have set a goal of reducing its carbon footprint. The university says Mr. Boyce of Peabody Energy is staying on its board -- and the students say they will keep protesting until that changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia Ho, one of the protesters, said, ''I think it's pretty fair to say that this issue isn't going away.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- All but giving up on Congress, President Obama has spent the year foraging for issues he could tackle on his own, and largely coming up with minor executive orders. But on Monday, he will unveil a plan to take on climate&nbsp;change that may be his last, most sweeping effort to remake America in his remaining time in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The far-reaching regulations will for the first time force power plants in the United States to curb the carbon emissions that scientists say have been damaging the planet. By using authority already embedded in law, Mr. Obama does not need Congress -- so, in this era of gridlock, he has a chance to transform the nation's energy sector and, at the same time, his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The shift to a cleaner-energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way,'' Mr. Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address, previewing Monday's announcement. ''But a low-carbon, clean-energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come. America will build that engine. America will build the future, a future that's cleaner, more prosperous and full of good jobs.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the administration was still completing crucial elements of the plan, it was already clear that the economic stakes are enormous. The new regulations could eventually shutter hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Critics wasted little time arguing that the president's unilateral plan abuses his power in a way that will cost jobs and raise energy prices for consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs,'' Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, the nation's top coal-producing state, said in response to Mr. Obama's Saturday address. ''If it succeeds in death by regulation, we'll all be paying a lot more money for electricity -- if we can get it. Our pocketbook will be lighter, but our country will be darker.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost by default, climate&nbsp;change looks to be the defining domestic initiative of Mr. Obama's second term. His aspirations to enact gun control measures, pass a jobs plan, overhaul the tax code and reach a grand bargain on long-term spending all have eluded him amid Republican opposition. He may yet negotiate legislation liberalizing immigration policy, but otherwise harbors little hope for major new domestic action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In taking on climate&nbsp;change, Mr. Obama is returning to one of the themes of his first campaign for president, when he vowed that his election would be remembered as the moment when ''our planet began to heal.'' His difficulties living up to that rhetoric has deeply frustrated many supporters, and he personally urged his Environmental Protection Agency chief, Gina McCarthy, to draft an ambitious regulation in time to ensure that it is finalized before he leaves office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the most significant executive action he can take probably in the entirety of his presidency,'' said Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ''The president is a relatively young president,'' she added. ''Not to do something would be something you wouldn't want to live with for the next few decades.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having failed to pass climate legislation through the Senate in his first term, Mr. Obama has used his own power to advance his goals, including increased fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. In seeking to limit power plants, he is finally addressing the most significant source of carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the most important and the biggest reductions that we'll get,'' said John D. Podesta, the president's counselor and a prime advocate of environmental policies. ''Finally tackling climate in a significant way, this is a big deal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the president seems to have chosen a low-wattage rollout of the plan. He will not unveil it in a televised East Room address or travel to some out-of-town venue for a big speech, as he has for moves of far less import. Instead, he will leave it to Ms. McCarthy to announce on Monday, while he plays a supporting role by making a telephone call to the American Lung Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may reflect the complicated politics of the issue. Republicans are not the only ones concerned about economic costs, or for that matter political ones. Democrats from coal-producing states are acutely nervous with midterm elections approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, for one, has already distanced himself from the plan. ''I will oppose this rule as it will adversely affect coal miners and coal-mining communities throughout West Virginia and the nation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials denied playing down the announcement and said they were trying to be creative because an East Room event is no longer as useful as it once was. They are trying to frame the issue as a matter of public health. To tape his Saturday address, Mr. Obama traveled to Children's National Medical Center in Washington to visit children with asthma aggravated by air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While studies show climate&nbsp;change may exacerbate respiratory diseases, that is hardly the most significant impact of global warming. But the White House hopes that focusing on sick children will play better politically than sweeping statements. An April Gallup poll found that one in four Americans is skeptical of the science of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulation, which must go through a period of public comment before taking effect, will set a national standard to cut carbon from power plants. It will offer states a menu of options to achieve those cuts, such as adding wind and solar power and energy-efficient technology and joining or creating state-level emissions trading programs called cap and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, the United States emitted 6.5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, of which two billion came from power plants, most burning coal. Experts close to the drafting of the rule said they expected it would lead to annual cuts of up to 500 million tons of carbon in the next decade and more than one billion tons of carbon annually in ensuing years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as recently as last week, according to people close to the process, officials had not decided which year to use as the baseline for determining cuts. The coal industry has pushed for 2005, when emissions were near their peak, while environmentalists want a baseline of 2012, when they were lower, meaning that cuts would have to be deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By using the existing Clean Air Act, Mr. Obama will not be able to go as far as new legislation, which would have affected the entire economy. ''It would have been better to get more done, absolutely,'' said Carol Browner, the president's former environmental adviser. ''But if you can't get there, using existing law to look at things on a sector basis is a very smart move.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rule will be announced hours before Mr. Obama leaves for Europe, where leaders have pressed him to be more assertive on climate&nbsp;change. ''By increasing our credibility with this rule, we leverage everybody else and put the president back in a leadership position,'' said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. ''He becomes seen as a climate leader.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Memorial Day 2050'' (May 26): Thomas L. Friedman and others who write about climate&nbsp;change and related problems are just tinkering around the edges. Those who address the issues persist in ignoring the fundamental problem: overpopulation. The solution is not about accommodating a growing global population in ingenious ways but about cutting the population in half and keeping it there. Metaphorically speaking, 10 billion people driving Priuses won't stop climate&nbsp;change. We must address the real problem rather than discuss symptoms and how to palliate them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Fiske, Encinitas, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Mr. Friedman, there are individual actions one can take to reduce dirty fossil-fuel use. Millions of American rooftops can become solar rooftops. Federal and state tax credits are on the cusp of creating a revolution. My daughter, my son, my wife and I are celebrating our newly installed rooftop solar systems: Three houses may not a revolution make, but we're thrilled to be able to take action to help generations to come. It feels good to send clean energy to the grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack and Helene Gilroy Endwell, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change presents us with the ''problem of the commons.'' It is outside of each individual's limited self-interest to care for our atmosphere, even though the future well-being of all the earth's inhabitants depends on it. Responding to climate&nbsp;change requires a shift in our sense of morality. How do we, as a society, teach that working for the common good is a basic responsibility? Framing the question properly is at least a start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Swensen, Pound Ridge, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should substitute natural gas for coal and encourage conservation. But we can't mandate what China and India do. We have to lead the way and make it imperative that they follow suit in order to compete. Only when it's in their economic self-interest to cut emissions will these countries do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark S. Dolecki, Baytown, Tex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To slow global warming, it is critical that millions of people change their personal habits and behaviors. The best place to begin is air travel, with its big carbon footprint: Three round-trip flights from Chicago to Frankfurt generate 10.6 tons of CO2 per passenger, and three round trips from Philadelphia to San Francisco create 6 tons of CO2 per passenger. Annually the average American produces 19 tons of CO2. So I challenge everyone who flies to dramatically reduce plane travel now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: The risk of climate conflict is real, but securitising the planet falls into the trap of those who profit from global conflict</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his speech at West Point Military Academy earlier this week, President Barack Obama described climate&nbsp;change as a &quot;creeping national security crisis&quot; that will require the armed forces to &quot;respond to refugee flows, natural disasters, and conflicts over water and food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech emphasised that US foreign policy in the 21st century is increasingly being honed in recognition of heightened risks of social, political and economic upheaval around the world due the impacts of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more detailed insight into US military planning could be seen in the report published a couple of weeks earlier by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) Military Advisory Board, written and endorsed by a dozen or so senior retired US generals. Describing climate&nbsp;change as a not just a &quot;threat multiplier,&quot; but now - even worse - a &quot;catalyst for conflict&quot;, the study concluded that environmental impacts from climate&nbsp;change in coming decades:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;.... will aggravate stressors abroad, such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions - conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, the link between climate&nbsp;change and the risk of violence is supported by many independent studies. No wonder, reports NBC News citing various former and active US officials, the Pentagon has long been mapping out strategies &quot;to protect US interests in the aftermath of massive floods, water shortages and famines that are expected to hit and decimate unstable nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the era of climate warfare is not laying in wait, in some far-flung distant future. It has already begun, and it is accelerating - faster than most predicted. Pentagon officials and the CNA's new study point to the Arab Spring upheavals across the Middle East and North Africa as a prime example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I've argued previously, violence and unrest in Syria and Egypt can be linked not just to the regional impacts of climate&nbsp;change in terms of water scarcity and food production, but also their complex interconnections with domestic oil and gas scarcity, neoliberal austerity, rampant inequality, endemic corruption, and massive political repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such cases show that climate&nbsp;change in itself does not drive conflict - but the way in which climate&nbsp;change interacts with multiple related factors like declining oil production, food prices, and overlapping political, cultural and economic processes is already generating wild cards that repressive states are ill-equipped to deal with. In that context, such states resort to the thing they do best in an increasingly uncertain world: more repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC) has warned in its latest climate impacts assessment, though, more repression just makes things even worse, triggering a vicious cycle of increasing vulnerabilty to climate destabilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study accepted for publication in the July issue of the American Meteorological Society's journal Weather, Climate, and Society, underscores the role of climate&nbsp;change and drought in Syria's ongoing civil war, which by some accounts has taken the lives of over 150,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research paper by Dr Peter Gleick demonstrates clearly that the Syrian conflict is not just a climate war, or a resource war, but a water war. Between 2006 and 2011, the country suffered the worst long-term drought and the most severe set of crop failures in recorded history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was compounded by water mismanagement and economic deterioration which, in turn, led to further agricultural failures, population dislocations and the migration of rural communities to nearby cities. The resulting combination of urban unemployment, inequality and food insecurity, affecting over a million people, heightened sectarian tensions, and helped spark the social unrest that exploded into conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the destabilising role of climate&nbsp;change in Syria did not come to light solely with hindsight - US officials were aware for years of the risks. In his paper, Dr Gleick, who is president of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security - refers toleaked US diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Damascus to the State Department in Washington DC warning of the implications of the unprecedented drought. In Gleick's words:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That cable describes a briefing by FAO Syrian Representative Abdullah bin Yehia on drought impacts, which he described as a 'perfect storm' when combined with other economic and social pressure. Concerns expressed at that time also noted that the population displacements 'could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures already at play and undermine stability in Syria.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response of the US national security apparatus (and that of its poodlish ally Britain) to such warnings is instructive. As I wrote in The Guardian last year, from 2009 through to 2011, US and UK special forces were training &quot;Syrian opposition forces&quot; with a view to elicit the &quot;collapse&quot; of Bashir al-Assad's regime &quot;from within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that oil-soaked, blood-drenched geopolitical gamble appears to have failed, the US and regional partner Israel have accommodated themselves to what the New York Times described as a &quot;horrific&quot; status quo that is nevertheless &quot;preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad's government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis.&quot; The west, adds America's newspaper of record, &quot;needs more time to prop up opposition forces it finds more palatable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this, indeed, is the problem: Viewed through the narrow, self-serving, systematically abused lens of 'national security' (which of course is the noble title of the American intelligence agency responsible for mass surveillance of entire populations), climate&nbsp;change becomes not a springboard for much-need social transformation to save the planet; instead it becomes the beaten-to-death horse justifying innovative new ways to save the profits of the few who run the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take a look at the CNA's thoughts on climate&nbsp;change and Africa, for instance. Africa is &quot;an increasingly important source of US oil and gas imports,&quot; but is &quot;suffering tension and stress resulting from weakgovernance&quot; and &quot;food and water shortages&quot; to be exacerbated by climate&nbsp;change. The Pentagon's new Africa Command thus &quot;reflects Africa's emerging strategic importance to the US.&quot; A &quot;worsening ofconditions&quot; due to climate impacts &quot;could prompt further US militaryengagement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the record hasn't been spectacular. Consider how the US and UK have tacitly overseen the expansion of Islamist extremism across North Africa at the behest ofclient-regime-aka-terror-state Algeria - all to access its oil and gas; a short-sighted strategy that indirectly led to the recent Nigeria crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The securitisation of climate&nbsp;change - and with it the entire planet - is not leading to meaningful transformative action to transform the social relations necessary to mitigate and prevent dangerous global warming. Instead, while climate&nbsp;change accelerates, the corporate-military-industrial complex accelerates profits. Indeed, the very companies most responsible for climate&nbsp;change are set to make a killing from its intensification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think climate&nbsp;change is a real opportunity for the aerospace and defense industry,&quot; said Lord Drayson, then British Minister of State for Strategic Defence Acquisition Reform, in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the world's largest defence contractors, Raytheon, agrees. In a briefing to the Carbon Disclosure Project last year, the corporation said that &quot;expanded business opportunities will arise&quot; as a result of &quot;security concerns and their possible consequences,&quot; due to the &quot;effects of climate&nbsp;change&quot; both at home and abroad in the form of &quot;storms, droughts, and floods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what happens when one views the world, even with the best of intentions, through the twin lenses of military might and economic clout. We become incapable of recognising that the fundamental obstacle to addressing our global challenges is that we see enemies everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change can create security risks, but to deal with them seriously, we need to stop projecting and recognise our own hand in the violence we're so terrified of out there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEWAUNEE, Wis. -- Bryan T. Pagel, a dairy farmer, watched as a glistening slurry of cow manure disappeared down a culvert. If recycling the waste on his family's farm would help to save the world, he was happy to go along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out back, machinery was breaking down the manure and capturing a byproduct called methane, a potent greenhouse gas. A huge Caterpillar engine roared as it burned the methane to generate electricity, keeping it out of the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $3.2 million system also reduces odors at Pagel's Ponderosa Dairy, one of the largest in Wisconsin, but it would not have been built without a surprising source of funds: a California initiative that is investing in carefully chosen projects, even ones far beyond its borders, to reduce emissions as part of the battle against climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When they came out here and told us they were willing to send us checks, we were thrilled,'' Mr. Pagel said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California's program is the latest incarnation of an increasingly popular -- and much debated -- mechanism that has emerged as one of the primary weapons against global warming. From China to Norway, Kazakhstan to the Northeastern United States, governments are requiring industries to buy permits allowing them to emit set levels of greenhouse gases. Under these plans, the allowable levels of pollution are steadily reduced and the cost of permits rises, creating an economic incentive for companies to cut emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system encourages companies to find the least expensive ways to make the cuts, either by adopting cleaner energy technology or by investing in outside emission-control projects, like the Pagels' methane digester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress rejected a national plan of this type during President Obama's first term, but 10 states, including most of those in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, have developed their own programs. And the approach is expected to get a huge lift on Monday when Mr. Obama unveils a long-awaited national plan requiring states to lower their power plant emissions. One likely effect will be to encourage more states to adopt systems like California's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the approach is spreading worldwide, with the number of people living in places that have such a system nearing one billion, or 14 percent of the world's population, including about 80 million Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The point now is to say, look, this can work, it can be scaled, and please join,'' said Frank A. Wolak, an economist at Stanford University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in the decade it has been used to tackle global warming, this approach has had a turbulent history. The world's largest such system, in Europe, has had severe problems, including gyrations in the prices that polluters have to pay. Given a lack of evidence that the system can actually solve the emissions problem, some environmental groups and scientists have developed serious reservations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The reason I don't support what we're doing is not that I don't think something needs to be done,'' said Myles R. Allen, a leading British climate scientist at Oxford University. ''I just don't think it's effective, and I don't see it ever being effective.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought-plagued California, which Gov. Jerry Brown recently called the ''epicenter'' of climate&nbsp;change, hopes to prove that capitalism can work in the fight against global warming. The state took great care in setting up its system, which is now being seen as a global test case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen months into the venture, it is still too soon to tell how well it will work. But the state has so far managed to avoid some of the mistakes that have plagued efforts in other parts of the world. Hundreds of industrial facilities have been brought under the plan, prompting those businesses to study how to use less energy, and fuel suppliers will be pulled into it next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the decade, the state is expected to collect about $5 billion a year in permit fees, with the bulk of the money being recycled into clean-energy projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide, other approaches to global warming are also being considered. A more ambitious push could be made on renewable energy, like solar and wind. Power companies might be ordered to capture their carbon emissions and bury them underground. Forests could be preserved or allowed to regrow to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all those methods have drawbacks, and interviews by The New York Times with more than 80 experts in nine countries revealed sharp disagreements about which to embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that limiting the effects of the human-induced warming will almost certainly cost trillions of dollars over generations and require an unprecedented level of cooperation across states and nations -- if it can be done at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How do we deal, as a global civilization, with a problem that is decades in the making and is caused by everything we do?'' asked Peter Miller, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. ''It's the challenge of our time, and there is no road map.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought, Rain and Fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, a body of scientists and other experts appointed by the United Nations, found last year that total emissions of carbon into the atmosphere must be kept below one trillion tons if global warming is to be held to tolerable levels. More than half that amount has been emitted since the beginning of the industrial era, and at the rate emissions are going up, the limit will be reached in 30 years or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the effects are being felt far and wide. A recent report, the National Climate Assessment, found that every corner of the United States was being hit hard, with more droughts in some regions, more torrential rains in others, worsening forest fires, melting land ice, and the deaths of millions of acres of trees from heat-loving insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the global stakes were made clear yet again when researchers reported that ice sheets in the western section of Antarctica had begun an irreversible breakup that could ultimately raise the level of the sea by 10 feet or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,'' the National Climate Assessment said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some environmental groups have contended that the best way to combat climate&nbsp;change would be for governments to impose tight regulations on businesses that produce greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists have argued, instead, that governments should put a price on emissions. The simplest way to do that would be a tax -- the same sort of sin tax applied to liquor and cigarettes, albeit on a vastly larger scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1960s, economists in Canada and the United States developed an alternative concept: a market in pollution rights, which they believed would allow companies to decide for themselves how to limit their emissions at the lowest cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That approach got its first major tryout in 1990 when the administration of George Bush embraced it to battle acid rain, persuading reluctant congressional Democrats to go along. It reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide far more cheaply than expected, and it was seen as a triumph of conservative thinking about the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy, called cap and trade, is now being applied to greenhouse gases. Governments impose a limit, or cap, on the amount of the gases that can be spewed into the atmosphere by polluters like power plants and refiners. It then issues permits, often called carbon allowances, equal to the level of the cap, with each permit representing a ton of emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government requires industries to acquire enough permits to equal their emissions. Companies that need permits buy them, either from the government or on a commodity market, with the value set by supply and demand. Over time, the government reduces the cap and the number of permits, driving up their value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system is intended to ensure that polluters reduce their emissions, but do it in a way that makes the most financial sense. A company might spend money to upgrade to more efficient equipment, for instance, if that is less expensive than buying permits at the market price at that time. The sale of permits also creates a flow of funds to reduce emissions in economic sectors not covered by the permit system, such as farming or forestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past decade, carbon allowances have become the world's newest commodity. Thousands of people -- in small offices in San Francisco, on trading floors in Houston, at power stations all over Europe -- now buy and sell the permits every day. They are not all representing polluters; some are simply speculators placing bets on what will happen to carbon prices over time. Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, a research firm, expects permits representing more than nine billion tons of emissions to trade hands this year, with a transaction value of nearly $90 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a few of these government-created markets have been seriously flawed, and some experts argue that time is being wasted on an effort that could, ultimately, fall short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems in Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the United States has been embroiled in a political argument over the past decade about whether climate&nbsp;change is even real, the European Union has largely embraced the science and moved forward. The European Emissions Trading System, which went into operation in 2005, has proved that a market in pollution permits can be made to work across barriers of language and national interest. Yet the European Union has also come to be seen as a case study in what can go wrong if such a system is not set up carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, instead of scrutinizing data on emissions, European regulators trusted companies to tell them how much greenhouse gas they were emitting. Since those numbers would be used in setting the initial emissions cap, the companies had an obvious incentive to exaggerate. When it finally became clear in 2006 that they had done so, and emissions were actually lower than traders had been led to believe, permits suddenly became less valuable and their price crashed in a matter of hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, just as Europe was tightening its rules, the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and 2009. ''You produced less electricity, less steel, less toilet paper -- less of everything that was included in the system,'' said Stig Schjolset, chief carbon markets analyst with Thomson Reuters Point Carbon in Oslo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union had put no mechanism in place to respond to these changing economic conditions, so governments kept cranking out carbon permits even as the decline in output meant that fewer were needed. Carbon prices tanked yet again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the European Union adopted changes that have firmed up prices somewhat. But at just over $7 per ton of carbon dioxide, they are still far below their peak, and below the $30 level that many analysts believe is needed to spur investment in cleaner energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the Europeans have yet to agree on long-term emission targets that would drive up carbon prices and reward investors in clean energy, though proposals are under discussion. ''Through the 2020s, there is no clear signal about how the cap will tighten,'' said Adrian Gault, chief economist with Britain's national Committee on Climate&nbsp;Change, which advises the government on the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's broader goals have by no means been a complete failure. The European Union set a target of lowering emissions 20 percent by 2020, and that appears likely to be met -- but several studies suggest that is less a result of the carbon market than of economic weakness, as well as subsidies for renewable power. Many experts in Europe fear that later, more ambitious goals will prove unattainable if companies have too little incentive to invest in clean technology. The experts believe emissions throughout the developed world need to fall 80 percent or more by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Even if we're fine to meet the emissions target for 2020, it will be very challenging to meet Europe's long-term targets,'' Mr. Schjolset said. ''For that, you need a higher carbon price now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California as Pioneer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Nichols cut her teeth as a young lawyer by successfully suing the California state government for violating the federal Clean Air Act. She has long since become an insider, running the most powerful state environmental agency in the country, California's Air Resources Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Nichols -- chosen by a Republican governor and kept on by the Democrat who succeeded him -- said that when her agency set out to create a carbon market, her European counterparts were candid in advising the state how not to repeat their mistakes. ''It was an act of great generosity on their part,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California's Global Warming Solutions Act, signed in 2006 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, set a goal of lowering California's greenhouse gases in 2020 to the 1990 level, a cut of 28 percent from the level they had been expected to reach in 2020 without the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after it was signed, the law was the subject of political and legal battles, with oil companies and other polluters fighting to overturn it. When voters were asked whether they wanted the state to tackle global warming in 2010, they voted 62 percent to 38 percent to move forward with the law, which requires more efficient cars, more renewable power on the state's electric grid and many other steps. A centerpiece was a provision capping emissions from big polluters, including power generators and gasoline refiners, and setting up a permit-trading system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California spent several years developing regulations, then began its cap-and-trade system in 2013. The project is taking hold gradually. California adopted rules shielding companies vulnerable to out-of-state competition, as well as residential electricity customers, from the full impact of the costs. In the early days, it is giving away many of the required carbon permits for free to ease companies into the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, at just over $11 a ton, the carbon price in California is now the highest in any cap-and-trade market, 60 percent above the price in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In setting up the market, California took measures to prevent the wild price gyrations seen in Europe. The state spent years getting accurate emissions data, for instance. And it established de facto floor and ceiling prices for its permits. The price so far has been highly predictable, trading in a range from $11 to $14 a ton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its plan, the state decided to allow emission-lowering projects in sectors not covered by the cap-and-trade system, such as forestry and farming. These ''offset projects,'' which can be located anywhere in the United States, are subject to strict auditing. The projects create credits that can be sold in the California market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New companies have sprung up to serve as middlemen, helping farmers, forest owners and others set up eligible offset projects. One of those companies, TerraPass of San Francisco, matched the Pagel dairy farm in Wisconsin with California's money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John T. Pagel, the owner, said that he had thought for several years about installing a system to reduce odors and capture methane emissions from the manure of thousands of cows. But he could not figure out how to make the economics work. ''It's the right thing to do, but it has to support itself, too,'' Mr. Pagel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he met a TerraPass representative at an agricultural fair several years ago and learned he could receive payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a tour of his farm near Kewaunee, Mr. Pagel proudly showed off the gear. A 20-cylinder Caterpillar engine, powered by methane from cow manure, throbbed in a large building behind his barns. As it turned a generator, it was pumping enough renewable power into the local electric grid to supply about 1,200 homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I love that thing!'' Mr. Pagel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his sons, Bryan, described meticulous oversight from California, including instruments that send a stream of data back to TerraPass headquarters to verify that the system is working properly. Otherwise, said Peter Freed, a former TerraPass employee who helped set up the deal, the state might disallow the carbon credits. ''The California system doesn't have a real tolerance for error,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it will not be clear for years how successful the state's carbon market has been in lowering emissions, or in spurring investment in clean energy. In the meantime, the Obama administration must decide how hard to push other states toward copying California's program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What's good for California, and what others will ultimately look to, is success,'' said Richard Corey, chief executive of the Air Resources Board. ''The ultimate test of success is going to be: Did it work?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioning Cap and Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some environmental groups and academics have never reconciled themselves to the idea of a market in pollution rights, and Europe's problems have heightened their doubts. So far, they point out, global emissions are still rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I would throw the markets out and start over with something different,'' said Doreen Stabinsky, a professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. ''I think we can't be sidetracked by playing around with a market, because this objective is so important, so pressing and so difficult.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists and analysts who support cap and trade say they are confident the problems can be worked out, and they believe California is in the process of proving it. The key issue now, they say, is whether governments that adopt these systems will tighten the emissions caps, driving up carbon prices -- and do it soon enough to make a real dent in global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second carbon market operating in the United States shows that the gradual lowering of emissions targets can have an impact. That system, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, started with far more modest goals than California's, covering a smaller segment of the economy, and for much of its history carbon prices were below $2 a ton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the system has worked smoothly for several years, generating $1.7 billion that nine state governments in the Northeast have used largely to support clean-energy projects. Those investments, as well as utilities' switch to cleaner natural gas, have sharply reduced carbon emissions in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the nine states decided to cut their emissions cap by 45 percent and to let carbon prices rise. They have nearly doubled, to $4 a ton, and the revisions are expected to spur still more clean-energy investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts believe that in the long run, carbon markets will make a substantial contribution only if they can be tied together across political boundaries. That would allow polluters to search the world for the cheapest ways of cutting emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a limited extent, such networking has already begun. Europe has allowed billions to flow abroad to developing countries, underwriting projects that have, for example, helped poor families switch to more efficient coal-burning stoves. California and Quebec have tied their markets together, and trading between them began early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's biggest carbon polluter, China, has begun experimenting with markets in seven cities and provinces, with a view toward forming a national carbon market this decade. Both California and Europe are tentatively speaking to the Chinese about future linkages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such developments take hold, the once unthinkable has begun to seem plausible, if by no means inevitable: a linked global carbon price high enough to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We might be witnessing the birth of a new system, without quite realizing it,'' said Glen P. Peters, a climate researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. ''When you think of all these bottom-up initiatives around the world, maybe we are living through the transformation right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts who support cap and trade contend that a market mechanism can reach more deeply into the economy than any other approach, changing the behavior even of people and companies that might not necessarily care about global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wisconsin dairymen perhaps serve as an example of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the methane-powered generator roared on his property, John T. Pagel said he was not convinced that the climatic changes happening in the United States were a result of human emissions. He suspects they might be part of a natural cycle. But with Californians dangling cash in exchange for his willingness to cut emissions, he jumped at the chance to build his digester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are doing exactly what they asked us to do to get paid to reduce carbon,'' Mr. Pagel said. ''If somebody else believes in it enough to put up the money, that's all I need to know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Climate&nbsp;Changes, So Does the Language</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change has created its own vocabulary of concepts and institutions. Here are a few of the terms that often come up in discussions of the problem and its proposed solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon market: A financial market where government-issued permits that regulate greenhouse-gas emissions are traded as a commodity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap and trade: A government-created system to restrict emissions by imposing a limit, or cap, on the amount of pollution that can be spewed into the atmosphere by certain industries. The government issues permits or carbon allowances to industries for the amount of greenhouse gases they are allowed to emit, then gradually reduces the cap and the number of permits, providing a financial incentive for those companies to pollute less. Companies that need fewer permits can trade with those that need more permits on a financial commodities market, with the price driven by supply and demand. The higher the price of the permits, the greater the incentive to reduce emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenhouse gas: A type of pollutant that scientists say contributes to global warming. The primary pollutant is carbon dioxide, but there is also methane, nitrous oxide and many refrigerants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon allowances: Government-issued permits to industries that allow them to pollute up to a certain limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon offsets: Projects that lower carbon emissions in nonregulated industries, such as forestry or farming. These projects produce ''offset credits'' that can be traded on the carbon market and used by polluters to comply with emissions limits. Governments usually set limits on how many of these types of credits polluters can use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon price: The cost to industries or companies for each ton of greenhouse gas that is emitted in a given period. The cost can be established directly by the government, in the form of a tax or a set price for permits, or indirectly through carbon markets, where permits are traded freely and supply and demand sets the price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon pricing: A system that requires polluters to pay for their carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pollution rights: Permission given by a government to an industry or company to pollute up to a certain controlled level. Such a system leaves it up to the company or industry to figure out the best way to stay within the limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissions Trading System: A financial market created by the European Union to trade the carbon allowances issued to industries to control carbon emissions. The system has been in effect since 2005 and covers about 11,000 power plants, industrial facilities and airlines in 31 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change: A body of scientists and other experts appointed by the United Nations to periodically assess and issue reports about the status and impact of climate&nbsp;change on the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Climate Assessment: A report issued periodically by the federal government and prepared by a panel of scientists and other experts, including representatives of fossil-fuel companies, to assess the status and impact of climate&nbsp;change on the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative: A cap-and-trade system limiting emissions in nine states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. The system has raised $1.7 billion for the governments, which have mostly put the money back into clean-energy projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Fix: This is the first in a series of articles examining potential solutions to climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- As nations rush to ship vast new stores of natural gas across oceans, the climate&nbsp;change implications of the fuel are coming under increased scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps nowhere is the debate so intense as in British Columbia, a province in western Canada where there are plans to export large quantities of natural gas to Asia. Environmentalists fear that the production and processing of the gas for export could upend the province's aggressive climate&nbsp;change policies, which include an emissions-reduction goal and an unusual carbon tax system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If facilities to export the gas are built, they ''will make it virtually impossible for British Columbia to meet its greenhouse gas targets,'' said Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia. For a province that has been a leader on climate&nbsp;change issues, she added, ''that's a huge change of direction.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to know exactly how British Columbia's natural gas boom will affect its climate goals and policies, although the province's government has promised to develop the resource in the most environmentally friendly way possible. What is clear is that British Columbia is a case study of competing priorities -- determination to battle climate&nbsp;change on the one hand, and eagerness to take advantage of a job-creating energy bonanza on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago, when the province began imposing a carbon tax, no drilling boom was in sight. The comprehensive tax was the first of its kind in North America, and environmentalists have hailed it as a relative success because greenhouse gas emissions fell after it was enacted, although other factors such as an economic slowdown were also at work. The province also established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33 percent from 2007 levels by 2020, although Dr. Harrison said the objective was ''not on track.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the climate moves came into effect, a drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing unearthed new deposits of natural gas in British Columbia. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, deploys a mix of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to release gas or oil trapped in rocks. Soon, the province's fields began producing copious amounts of gas, and production rose about 40 percent from 2008 to 2013. But drillers had trouble selling the gas to one of their mainstay markets, the United States, because of a parallel American gas boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So British Columbia began looking to export its surplus to Asia. Eager buyers are at hand. China, which is struggling with air pollution, is eager to find substitutes for coal in its power plants, and Japan wants replacements for nuclear power. Large companies lined up to build multibillion-dollar gas export facilities in the province. Thirteen such facilities are now planned, according to the provincial government, but not all are likely to be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drillers say that the world should welcome the boom, partly because it will help China move away from coal, which burns less cleanly than natural gas. Environmentalists counter that the calculus is more complex, because natural gas could take the place of renewable energy that nations like China and Japan also want to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists also warn of leaks from natural gas production and pipeline facilities, which can send the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere. Industry representatives say that British Columbia's standards for reducing methane releases are already high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much debate in British Columbia centers on the 13 facilities planned to export natural gas. These facilities transform natural gas into a liquid so the fuel can fit compactly onto ships. The process of liquefying the gas has two basic parts, according to Tom Rufford, a lecturer at the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Queensland in Australia. First, the facilities remove contaminants such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, butane and water. Then, acting like giant refrigerators, they cool the gas to minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit so that it becomes liquid. The liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., then gets loaded into tanks for transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plants that liquefy the gas are generally powered by natural gas. The energy needed to remove contaminants and liquefy the gas can amount to roughly 10 percent of the energy contained in the gas produced by the plant, Dr. Rufford said. He added that the facilities were ''very efficient to start with, compared to some other industrial processes,'' like coal-fired power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some environmental groups in British Columbia, such as Clean Energy Canada, want the facilities that liquefy the gas to use electricity derived largely from wind farms and local hydroelectric facilities for power, instead of mechanical energy and electricity from on-site natural gas-fired turbines. One relatively small proposed facility, called Woodfibre L.N.G., plans to use grid electricity rather than gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some in the industry say that using grid electricity -- which in British Columbia is largely made from hydropower -- is impractical. Greg Kist, president of Pacific NorthWest L.N.G., a proposed $11 billion liquefaction facility majority owned by the Malaysian oil and gas giant Petronas, said his project planned to use gas, rather than electric power from the grid, because of the substantial energy requirements of the plant and the time frame in which power is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's very limited sources of power at that scope and scale in order to provide power for the facility,'' he said. His plant would process natural gas that is relatively free of contaminants like carbon dioxide -- one of several measures that will save energy, he said. The facility could begin construction next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Coleman, British Columbia's deputy premier and minister of natural gas development, was unavailable for an interview. But a ministry representative said in an email that the province's carbon tax leadership would guide its decisions on liquefied natural gas. ''The province is working to ensure B.C.'s L.N.G. operations are the cleanest in the world. Discussions are taking place with industry now to make this a reality.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists are skeptical. A report last year from Clean Energy Canada estimated that typical liquefied natural gas facilities in British Columbia would produce almost three times as much carbon pollution per unit of liquefied gas as a facility in Norway and another in Australia, which the report cited as global leaders. (The figures include the production and piping of natural gas as well as the process of turning it into a liquid.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But gas producers say that British Columbia's carbon policies will influence their efforts. ''I think B.C. is and will continue to be a leader in many aspects of environmental policy,'' said Dave Collyer, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Natural gas, he said, would fit into that framework.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">550 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The White House hawks its energy policies ahead of a move to restrict carbon dioxide from power plants. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has released a report charting progress on several energy fronts that is clearly aimed at setting the stage ahead of President Obama's expected announcement next Monday of the first regulations restricting carbon dioxide from existing power plants. (It's been a very long journey - abetted by an important Supreme Court decision, since President George W. Bush tried to restrict carbon dioxide from such plants and quickly reversed course.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One interesting facet of the report, &quot;The All-Of-The-Above Energy Strategy as a Path to Sustainable Economic Growth,&quot; is how much of the progress it describes - particularly in reductions of petroleum and coal use - came as a complete surprise. (Read &quot;Why Energy Forecasting Goes Wildly Wrong,&quot; a recent paper in the Journal of Energy Security, for some background on this consistent phenomenon.) Here's one graph that shows how this works: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's plenty of value in the report besides the reminder not to pay too much attention to predictions. But I still think the president needs to do more than proclaim &quot;all of the above.&quot; Among other things, Obama needs to spell out more clearly how he plans to clamp down on leakage from natural gas production, sustain investments in basic energy research despite lower energy prices and also overcome barriers to the deployment of non-polluting energy technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a related front, it'll be interesting to see if the White House tries to use the power plant rule as leverage in moving beyond the fight over the increasingly irrelevant Keystone pipeline extension. In 2011, I wrote, &quot;This particular pipeline has a good chance of dying on the vine in any case if and when easier, less expensive sources of transportation fuel come online&quot; and that appears to be what's happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, the report, and the hints of what's coming next week, show that the White House is largely on a wise track. And it's a track that synchronizes well with an important pitch for a new post-treaty approach to climate negotiations outlined by former senators Tim Wirth and Tom Daschle in Yale Environment 360 last week. Wirth and Daschle see failure ahead if the goal in late 2015 at talks in Paris is a binding document: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than strive for an elusive, binding global treaty, the idea is to encourage countries to make strong national commitments in their own economic self-interest and then roll those up in the Paris agreement, which would not take the form of a treaty and thus would not need to be ratified. Countries would be motivated to take these actions in response to competition, both economic and political; international peer pressure; and the aspirations of their own people. The overarching goal is to spur national action to bend the carbon curve downward in a meaningful and measurable fashion, giving greater certainty to the private sector to innovate and invest in low-carbon technologies. This is the world's best option for accelerating progress and averting catastrophic climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a remarkable and creditable shift away from the 20th-century approach, which focused on binding, but unenforceable, targets and timetables that would never be accepted by the countries that mattered most (the United States and China). &quot;A triumph of climate pragmatism,&quot; indeed.                      </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS month, a report issued by a prominent military advisory board concluded that climate&nbsp;change posed a serious threat to America's national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors, 16 retired high-ranking officers, warned that droughts, rising seas and extreme weather events, among other environmental threats, were already causing global ''instability and conflict.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a stalwart believer that global warming is a ''hoax,'' dismissed the report as a publicity stunt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the senator needs a history lesson, because climate&nbsp;change has been leading to global conflict -- and even the collapse of civilizations -- for more than 3,000 years. Drought and famine led to internal rebellions in some societies and the sacking of others, as people fleeing hardship at home became conquerors abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most vivid examples comes from around 1200 B.C. A centuries-long drought in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions, contributed to -- if not caused -- widespread famine, unrest and ultimately the destruction of many once prosperous cities, according to four recent studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists determined the length and severity of the drought by examining ancient pollen as well as oxygen and carbon isotope data drawn from alluvial and mineral deposits. All of their conclusions are corroborated by correspondence, inscribed and fired on clay tablets, dating from that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ancient letters from the Hittite kingdom, in what is now modern-day Turkey, beseech neighboring powers for shipments of grain to stave off famine caused by the drought. (The drought is thought to have affected much of what is now Greece, Israel, Lebanon and Syria for up to 300 years.) One letter, sent from a Hittite king, pleads for help: ''It is a matter of life or death!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another letter, sent from the city of Emar, in what is now inland Syria, states simply, ''If you do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger.'' The kingdom of Egypt, as well as the city of Ugarit, on the coast of what is now Syria, responded with food and supplies, but it is not clear if they were able to provide enough relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It certainly created problems of national security for the great powers of the time. Correspondence between the Egyptians, Hittites, Canaanites, Cypriots, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Assyrians and Babylonians -- effectively, the Group of 8 of the Late Bronze Age -- includes warnings of attacks from enemy ships in the Mediterranean. The marauders are thought to have been the Sea Peoples, possibly from the western Mediterranean, who were probably fleeing their island homes because of the drought and famine and were moving across the Mediterranean as both refugees and conquerors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One letter sent to Ugarit advised the king to ''be on the lookout for the enemy and make yourself very strong!'' The warning probably came too late, for another letter dating from the same time states: ''When your messenger arrived, the army was humiliated and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floors was burned and the vineyards were also destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it! May you know it!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While sea levels may not have been rising then, as they are now, changes in the water temperature may have been to blame for making life virtually unlivable in parts of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2012 study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science found that the surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea cooled rapidly during this time, severely reducing precipitation over the coasts. The study concluded that agriculture would have suffered and that the conditions might have influenced the ''population declines, urban abandonments and long-distance migrations associated with the period.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To top it off, catastrophic events, in the form of a series of earthquakes, also rocked many ancient cities in these areas from around 1225 to 1175 B.C. These, together with the famines and droughts, would have further undermined the societies of the time, most likely leading to internal rebellions by the underclass and peasant populations who were facing severe food shortages, as well as invasions by migrating peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still do not know the specific details of the collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age or how the cascade of events came to change society so drastically. But it is clear that climate&nbsp;change was one of the primary drivers, or stressors, leading to the societal breakdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The era that followed is known as the first Dark Ages, during which the thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C. suddenly ceased to exist. It took decades, and even hundreds of years in some areas, for the people in these regions to rebuild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live in a world that has more similarities to that of the Late Bronze Age than one might suspect, including, as the British archaeologist Susan Sherratt has put it, an ''increasingly homogeneous yet uncontrollable global economy and culture'' in which ''political uncertainties on one side of the world can drastically affect the economies of regions thousands of miles away.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one important difference. The Late Bronze Age civilizations collapsed at the hands of Mother Nature. It remains to be seen if we will cause the collapse of our own.</SPAN></P>

Not one government has the foresight to see and possibly change what Planet Earth might look like 50 or 100 years from now. The denial of climate&nbsp;change science amounts to a death sentence for many plant and animal species, including us humans.

The finding was based not on different dosage schedules, but on blood levels of the drug. Therefore, anything less than a daily dose cannot be recommended unless studies now underway determine that Truvada prevents H.I.V. when taken less often. For now, federal guidelines recommend use every day, and that should be our strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama is expected to announce on Monday an Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon pollution from the nation's fleet of 600 coal-fired power plants, in a speech that government analysts in Beijing, Brussels and beyond will scrutinize to determine how serious the president is about fighting global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation will be Mr. Obama's most forceful effort to reverse 20 years of relative inaction on climate&nbsp;change by the United States, which has stood as the greatest obstacle to international efforts to slow the rise of heat-trapping gases from burning coal and oil that scientists say cause warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president had tried, without success, to move a climate&nbsp;change bill through Congress in his first term, and such legislation would now stand no chance of getting past the resistance of Republican lawmakers who question the science of climate&nbsp;change. So Mr. Obama is taking a controversial step: He is using his executive authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act to issue an E.P.A. regulation taking aim at coal-fired power plants, the nation's largest source of carbon pollution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am closely watching this. This standard is the real test of how serious the Obama climate action plan really is,'' said Qi Ye, director of the Climate Policy Center at Tsinghua University in China. The university is one of about half a dozen institutions that the Chinese government has tasked with immediately analyzing the new rule, according to Chinese experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China and the United States, the world's two largest economies and greenhouse gas polluters, are locked in a stalemate over global warming. While today China pollutes more than the United States, Chinese officials insist that, as a developing economy, China should not be forced to take carbon-cutting actions. China has demanded that the United States, as the world's historically largest polluter, go first. Chinese policy experts say that Mr. Obama's regulation could end that standoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If the standard is really stringent, that will make a difference in the domestic debate in China,'' Mr. Qi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Qi said that while he did not expect the Chinese government to publicly comment on the E.P.A. rule, a strong regulation -- like one that led to a 20 percent cut in coal plant pollution -- could stimulate policy changes. ''It will have an impact,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.P.A. rule comes at a crucial moment in the fraught international effort to slow global warming. In March, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society, released a report warning that human-caused climate&nbsp;change is leading to food and water shortages, extreme heat waves and droughts, rising sea levels, and stronger storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But scientists have also warned that collective action, with carbon cuts by all the major economies, is essential to achieve the drastic reduction in carbon pollution necessary to stave off the most destructive impacts of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This December, leaders from many nations will gather in Lima, Peru, at a United Nations summit meeting aimed at drafting a treaty, to be signed in 2015, that would legally bind the world's major economies to cut their carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to avoid the debacle of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the world's first attempt to forge a climate&nbsp;change treaty, which was effectively rendered null when the United States Senate refused to ratify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. Obama moves ahead using his existing authority under the Clean Air Act, governments around the world have taken notice -- and tried to learn everything they can about the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're very excited to see the new rule on existing power plants. We see this as absolutely the backbone of U.S. climate strategy,'' said G&uuml;nter H&ouml;rmandinger, environmental counselor to the European Union delegation in Washington. The European Union, which enacted a carbon-cutting policy after the Kyoto Protocol, has been among the critics of the United States' climate&nbsp;change policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Once it's out, I will be rushing to understand it and report back to Brussels,'' said Mr. H&ouml;rmandinger, an Austrian who has spent the past four years studying the Clean Air Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the United States, opponents of the climate&nbsp;change rule, chiefly the nation's coal industry, are preparing to fight with lawsuits, and global analysts are assessing whether the rule will stand up to those attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it can be done legally, going back to the Supreme Court decision that led to E.P.A.'s authority to regulate carbon emissions,'' said Mario Molina, a climate policy adviser to President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto of Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico, which enacted an ambitious climate&nbsp;change law in 2012, has urged other Latin American nations to pass similar legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many governments are also mindful of the opposition to climate&nbsp;change science in the United States Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peru's environment minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, paid attention when Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, questioned the science of climate&nbsp;change this month on ABC News's ''This Week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Senator Rubio shows us that there are still people who are skeptical of the science, even though we are already suffering the consequences of climate&nbsp;change,'' Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said. ''The government faces resistant actors, skepticism from political leaders -- it's the same in the international arena.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps no governments are anticipating the rule with more urgency than those in the small island nations that could be threatened if sea levels rise. A series of scientific reports have concluded that as the planet warms, melting polar ice will drive up sea levels two to four feet by the end of the century, threatening the very existence of some of those islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The path we're on right now is that our country will disappear,'' said Ronald Jean Jumeau, the United Nations ambassador from the island nation of Seychelles, and a spokesman for the Alliance of Small Island States. ''This will slow things down and give us more time to adapt and restructure our economies. Taking action now gives us more breathing room.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also paying close attention will be Saudi Arabia, which has sought to block global action on climate&nbsp;change. Economies that are deeply dependent on producing fossil fuels fear that lowering the global demand for oil and gas presents a grave economic threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everyone knows that the U.S. is key to achieve any solution to the climate&nbsp;change crisis,'' wrote Wael Hmaidan, director of a Lebanon-based advocacy group, Climate Action Network. ''Many OPEC countries, who do not want to see the world wean itself from fossil fuels, realize this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One world capital that will not be paying much attention is Moscow. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is an open skeptic of climate science, and Russia, as one of the world's largest producers of oil and gas, has generally been dismissive of efforts to forge a climate&nbsp;change treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change is snubbed in Russia,'' said Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy minister of energy and president of the Institute of Energy Policy, a Moscow think tank. ''It is a very climate-change-skeptical society.''</SPAN></P>

Pielke, Jr., has pointed out for a decade, &quot;climate&nbsp;change&quot; has proved problematic in a more technical sense - with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate&nbsp;Change defining the term differently, in ways that have significant ramifications in treaty negotiations. (The climate panel definition includes both human-driven and natural change; the treaty process only deals with climate&nbsp;change driven by the buildup of greenhouse gases.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's an excerpt from Leiserowitz's summary: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found that the term global warming is associated with greater public understanding, emotional engagement, and support for personal and national action than the term climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the term global warming is associated with: Greater certainty that the phenomenon is happening, especially among men, Generation X (31-48), and liberals;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater understanding that human activities are the primary cause among Independents;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater understanding that there is a scientific consensus about the reality of the phenomenon among Independents and liberals;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More intense worry about the issue, especially among men, Generation Y (18-30), Generation X, Democrats, liberals and moderates;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A greater sense of personal threat, especially among women, the Greatest Generation (68+), African-Americans, Hispanics, Democrats, Independents, Republicans, liberals and moderates;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher issue priority ratings for action by the president and Congress, especially among women, Democrats, liberals and moderates;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater willingness to join a campaign to convince elected officials to take action, especially among men, Generation X, liberals and moderates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate nationally representative survey, we found that while Americans are equally familiar with the two terms, they are four times more likely to say they hear the term global warming in public discourse than climate&nbsp;change. Likewise, Americans are two times more likely to say they personally use the term &quot;global warming&quot; in their own conversations than climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results strongly suggest that global warming and climate&nbsp;change are used differently and mean different things in the minds of many Americans. Scientists often prefer the term climate&nbsp;change for technical reasons, but should be aware that the two terms generate different interpretations among the general public and specific subgroups. Some issue advocates have argued that the term climate&nbsp;change is more likely to engage Republicans in the issue, however, the evidence from these studies suggests that in general the terms are synonymous for Republicans - i.e., neither term is more engaging than the other, although in several cases, global warming generates stronger feelings of negative affect and stronger perceptions of personal and familial threat among Republicans; they are also more likely to believe that global warming is already affecting weather in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the use of the term climate&nbsp;change appears to actually reduce issue engagement by Democrats, Independents, liberals, and moderates, as well as a variety of subgroups within American society, including men, women, minorities, different generations, and across political and partisan lines.</SPAN></P>

Could Australia really go down this path?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new conservative government in Australia proposes to be the first country in the world to abolish a legislated&nbsp;price on carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could Australia really go down this path?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, a bit of background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Labor government was elected in 2007 in a historic landslide. The defeated prime minister had refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol for over a decade, and the new Rudd government made a symbolic gesture with its first official act to ratify the protocol. The Labor government's policy, which was bipartisan, was to introduce an emissions trading scheme. Newly elected prime minister Kevin Rudd described climate&nbsp;change as &quot;the greatest&nbsp;moral, economic and social&nbsp;challenge&nbsp;of our time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast forward to 2009, and the then-opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, from the conservative Liberal party, was defeated in a party-room ballot by Tony Abbott by a single vote. The defining issue of that ballot was the emissions trading scheme legislation in the senate, where denialist Liberal party senators sabotaged Turnbull's negotiations with Rudd and climate-change minister Penny Wong. On the sidelines was the Greens political party, who opposed the emissions trading legislation on the basis that it didn't go far enough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emissions trading laws were supported by a wide coalition of environment groups, civil society organisations and trade unions, including the peak body (the ACTU) and the coal-miners union (the CFMEU), who said around this time:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the CFMEU has been a supporter of carbon pricing since the 1990s. The union sees this as not only beneficial for the Australian and global community, but for protecting the jobs of its members by transforming their industries into low emissions industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Abbott as newly installed opposition leader, the conservative Liberal party and National party (who are in a formal Coalition) voted with the Greens political party to block the emissions trading bill. Two&nbsp;moderate Liberal senators crossed the floor to vote with Labor in favour of the ETS laws (as did Malcolm Turnbull in the House of Representatives), but they were still defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the emissions trading laws were defeated and no substantial progress was made at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, Rudd made the fateful decision to delay new legislation on carbon pricing and in so doing started a steep and rapid decline in his personal approval rating (a topic covered in the book Power Failure by Phillip Chubb).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new opposition leader Tony Abbott, elected with the support of the climate&nbsp;change denying camp within his party, and egged on by climate deniers in the conservative press, ramped up a scare campaign against the carbon price. Abbott notoriously described climate&nbsp;change as &quot;crap&quot; and on numerous occasions has repeated denialist talking points that global warming has stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010&nbsp;Julia Gillard became prime minister and took to the election a promise to legislation emissions trading. In an election-eve interview she fatefully repudiated a simple carbon tax -- the preferred policy of the Greens party -- although she did clarify the distinction between emissions trading and a carbon tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the minority government arrangements, Labor introduced the Clean Energy Future laws, an emissions trading scheme with a cap, and a temporary fixed price for carbon emission permits. Tony Abbott, and the anti-climate action media cheer squad, called it a carbon tax and a broken promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It stuck. A three year fear campaign followed, including incendiary language from Abbott declaring among other things a &quot;blood oath&quot; that he would repeal the carbon price:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am giving you the most definite commitment any politician can give that this tax will go. This is a pledge in blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three years after the 2010 election were characterised by vicious and personal attacks against Julia Gillard and several independent members of parliament. Tony Abbott and senior members of his front bench were at the forefront of&nbsp;the attacks, including speaking at rallies in front of banners describing Gillard as a &quot;witch&quot; and a &quot;bitch&quot;, and at which the carbon price &quot;broken promise&quot; was used as a stalking horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the carbon price bills&nbsp;were brought into parliament and passed into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite protestations that the sky would fall, that it would &quot;python squeeze&quot; the economy or act as a &quot;wrecking ball&quot;, and whole towns would be wiped off the map (literally, Tony Abbott did say this would happen), the emissions trading scheme quietly did what it was supposed to do: reduce carbon emissions and increase renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change program manager for the Australian Conservation Foundation, Victoria McKenzie-McHarg, was emphatic in a statement to me last week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carbon price is working. That's the bottom line here. The latest Greenhouse Emissions Reports show that in the electricity sector - the polluters that have to pay - their pollution fell by five percent in a year. Compare that to a nearly six per cent increase&nbsp;in 'fugitive emissions' from mining, which isn't covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2011 to 2013, carbon emissions from electricity supply, the major source of carbon pollution in Australia, reduced by 7 percent, due both to the carbon price and growth in renewable energy. Renewable energy in Australia grew by around 30 percent from 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Australia was one of the few economies and job markets in the world that grew, while inflation remained low. Economist Stephen Koukoulas wrote for the ABC:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the jobs results, total employment has risen by 160,400 since the carbon price commenced, which again stands in contrast to the claims from the fear mongers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Abbott noted that &quot;the truth about this carbon tax is that it's bad for business, it's bad for jobs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line of all of this is that the economy is still growing, creating jobs and registering a quite stunning lift in wealth in the period since carbon was priced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key element of the carbon price is the cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cap, and not the price, is the crucial element that limits carbon pollution, because it is both a discipline for reducing emissions, and the cap itself is reduced over time to create scarcity in permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the fundamental difference between the emissions trading scheme, and the simple carbon tax that was proposed by the likes of the Greens political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Treasury secretary Ken Henry said in March this year, on ABC's&nbsp;7.30 program:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point here is this: if we are indeed going to commit to reducing Australia's carbon emissions below some business-as-usual baseline level - and that does seem to be the commitment of all politicians in Australia, at least of major political parties - if that's what we're going to do, then tackling that issue through any mechanism other than an emissions trading scheme will necessarily be more damaging on the Australian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there were a range of complimentary measures with the Labor government's carbon price, including significant investment in renewable energy technology, and a (bi-partisan) mandatory renewable energy target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new conservative government led by Tony Abbott is planning on winding back almost all of these policies. After his election last year, he declared abolishing carbon pricing his &quot;top legislative priority&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could he do it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest barrier to the abolition of the carbon price is the Australian senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Labor and the Greens party oppose the blanket repeal of the carbon price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's position is to support emissions trading with a cap; before the 2013 election, Kevin Rudd affirmed his intent to bring forward the floating price and end the fixed-price period early. At the time he announced this, I strongly supported the move in another column for The Guardian, based on the principle that emissions trading should rely on the cap to price the permits, rather than regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's climate spokesman Mark Butler has made Labor's position clear:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are very clear as the Labor Party that an Emissions Trading Scheme should remain the policy of Australia, should remain in place from the first of July next year. We are very clear in the view that it is the most effective and the cheapest way to bring down carbon pollution. The most effective because it has a legislated cap on carbon pollution, which is able to move over time as international negotiations progress and as the country decides to shift its targets for emissions reductions. And it's the cheapest way because it lets business work out the easiest, the cheapest and the most effective way to operate within that cap rather than having, frankly, the Minister or the Minister's bureaucrats in Canberra, decide what the best way to operate should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So neither&nbsp;Labor nor&nbsp;the Greens party will support Abbott's repeal legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wild card in the Australian senate is Clive Palmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palmer, a billionaire coal mining baron and tropical resort owner, is the leader of the eponymous Palmer United Party, with a coalition of four senators (including independent Ricky Muir of Victoria) from 1 July 2014. Palmer is a right-wing populist, who defected from the Queensland branch of the Liberal-National Party after being a life member&nbsp;and a major donor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palmer's position on the carbon price is erratic, and appears to be&nbsp;driven by public sentiment and the personal political animosities of parliament house. In April, Palmer declared that his party may oppose attempts to abolish the carbon price, according to a report in The Australian newspaper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Palmer said given the Coalition's tactics on direct action - which the mining magnate condemns as a waste of money - that support may not be forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they're going to adopt a tactic like that we'll have to reconsider our position when it comes to the mining tax and the carbon tax,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Palmer claims direct action is a&nbsp;&quot;token gesture&quot; and a Coalition &quot;slush fund&quot; to appease consultants and lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written extensively on the sham that is the Coalition government's &quot;direct action&quot; policy. The government's direct action policy is fundamentally flawed, and part of this flaw is the lack of a cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been strongly criticised by numerous organisations and experts, including by former Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull who described it in parliament as &quot;a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale&quot;. Even former Liberal Treasurer Peter Costello has said&nbsp;the Coalition should&nbsp;scrap the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading environmental campaigner, Blair Palese, the Australian CEO of 350.org told me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direct action provides no price signal to change behaviour and actually rewards inaction. No serious economist supports it and even business leaders have said it's confusing and unworkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palese's&nbsp;view is widely shared in the environment movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACF's McKenzie-McHarg said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direct action, as it is currently proposed, simply can't do the job of cutting Australia's pollution to the levels we know are needed. Add to that the tiny - and shrinking - amount of money allocated by the government to direct action, and you have what seems to be a fig leaf policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, not a single economist, climate scientist or conservation group has come out to publicly support direct action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-term outlook is in favour of a carbon constrained future. A recent&nbsp;Parliamentary Library paper on emission trading&nbsp;policies noted that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mid-2012 the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University undertook a survey of expectations from industry participants and other carbon price 'experts'. According to the results of this survey, 79&nbsp;per cent of the 76&nbsp;respondents expect that there will be a carbon price in Australia in 2020 and 81&nbsp;per cent expect an Australian carbon price in 2025. However, 38&nbsp;per cent expect the current carbon pricing legislation to be repealed by the end of 2015 and 40&nbsp;per cent expect repeal by 2016. Of those who think the carbon price will be repealed, one-half expect that a carbon price will be reinstated by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, seven years after the election of the Labor government and three years since the introduction of carbon pricing, it now looks like public opinion is coming full-circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With repeated&nbsp;statements by serious scientific reports and organisations puts certainty that man-made carbon emissions are causing global warming at 95 percent -- the same level of certainty for the connection between tobacco and lung cancer&nbsp;--&nbsp;Fairfax&nbsp;reported recently that the Lowy Institute poll, which has tracked attitudes toward climate&nbsp;change, is seeing an &quot;upward trend in the number of Australians who see climate&nbsp;change as a 'serious and pressing problem'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, this is good news. pic.twitter.com/Srf7X9j38B</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) May 23, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Essential Poll has also shown the public's attitude towards the reality of climate&nbsp;change increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive Palmer may currently propose to frustrate Abbott's plans to abolish the carbon price, but he is no proponent of climate&nbsp;change action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His public statements on climate&nbsp;change seem to be drawn from popular climate denialist websites. For example, in an interview on Lateline in March 2014 he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's just ludicrous to say that we haven't got a global solution with this false carbon tax that's imposed. It's just another method for raising money by the Government. Now we know that 97 per cent of the world's carbon comes from natural sources. Why don't we have money to look at how we can reduce the overall carbon signature by reducing it from nature, not just from industry. It's entirely wrong-focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These views are hardly surprising, given the source of Palmer's wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worrying thing about them though is that it places Australia's climate policy future in the hands of what Giles Parkinson from Renew Economy terms &quot;policy fringe dwellers&quot;. Alongside Palmer and his senators are the likes of conservative senator John Madigan, who opposes renewable energy and wind turbines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Australia did abolish the legislated carbon price, it would be the first any only country in the world to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is such an absurd prospect that the very notion baffles other nations, as the response from several European ambassadors to Australia made clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian Ambassador&nbsp;Pier Francesco Zazo noted that &quot;we were all a little bit surprised... there was as surprise that environment wasn't considered one of the priority issues&quot; at the proposal to abolish the carbon price, especially given Australia's presidency of the G20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swedish Ambassador likewise expressed cautionary views about direct action and the abolition of the carbon price, &quot;I must say I am amazed the Liberal government doesn't choose a market mechanism to regulate the emissions. I think that's really shocking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Internal Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde has expressed unease at the abolition of the carbon price, indicating that the the IMF is concerned the Australian government doesn't consider global warming risks to be real or are being taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the world is moving towards carbon pricing, emissions trading and emissions caps. Nations like South Korea, China and Mexico are joining or have joined the EU&nbsp;and&nbsp;states in the USA and Canada, in legislating for carbon prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abolishing the carbon price would place a heavy burden on Australians only a few years into the future, not to mention generations yet to come, by frustrating the transition to a low-carbon economy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were the Australian government to abolish the carbon price, it would be an act of gross negligence, and would risking returning Australia to global pariah-status, as it was when it refused to ratify Kyoto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year has already produced three alarming reports involving climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reaffirmed the overwhelming consensus among scientists that the planet is warming, that humans and the burning of fossil fuels are largely responsible, and that the world must take aggressive, concerted action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal National Climate Assessment described frightening changes, including unusually severe and persistent droughts, already occurring in the United States. And two weeks ago, two groups of scientists reported that the West Antarctic ice sheet had begun to disintegrate irreversibly, a process that, over centuries, could cause a large and destructive rise in the oceans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all this, many leading politicians continue to dispute the science and resist any effort to regulate and reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. Among the prominent deniers are two Floridians -- Senator Marco Rubio and Gov. Rick Scott -- whose state is greatly at risk from even modest and relatively short-term increases in sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of this is to be expected in a political season, when politicians will do almost anything to prey on the public's fear of job losses. What is truly depressing is the news that Wyoming's State Legislature has become the first in the nation to reject the new national science standards for schools, standards that include instruction on the human contribution to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislators' action arose from various motives, including hostility to government regulation generally and, more specifically, any teaching that seems to threaten the coal, oil and natural gas industries that are important to Wyoming's economy. But it seemed also to be a willful effort to leave a whole generation of children in the dark about climate science. This is more than standard-issue political posturing. It is madness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third National Climate Assessment report -- released on May 6 by the White House, and representing the work of more than 240 scientists -- warns us about our hazardous future and offers many good ideas for dealing with it. But a most important point may be lost in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After discussing how to mitigate the coming dangers, the report says, ''Commercially available mechanisms such as insurance can also play a role in providing protection against losses due to climate&nbsp;change.'' That sentence should have been in big, bold letters and underlined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because of the substantial risk that efforts to stop global warming will fail. The implications are staggering, and we must encourage private innovation and government support to insure against the devastating financial losses that will result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is an age-old one: Each country has a strong individual incentive to take a free ride on the rest of the world -- to find self-serving or nationalistic justifications for adding carbon dioxide and other pollutants to the global air supply. Such behavior, which in some ways might benefit the individual country while hurting everyone else, is known in economics as an externality problem, and the world has never solved one of this magnitude. We must face facts: There is a real risk of new kinds of climate-related disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest book, ''The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty and Economics for a Warming World'' (Yale University Press), my Yale colleague William D. Nordhaus describes the uncertainty of global warming's specific effects around the world. We are taking major gambles with our environment, he says. Expect surprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, a United Nations report identified with ''high confidence'' a number of risks that will be visited on different people unequally. It spoke of the ''risk of death, injury, ill health or disrupted livelihoods'' in low-lying coastal zones and on small islands -- and that is just the start. Food systems may break down. There may not be enough water for drinking and irrigation. Ecosystems may be shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, we need to worry about the potential for greater-than-expected disasters, especially those that concentrate their fury on specific places or circumstances, many of which we cannot now predict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why global warming needs to be addressed by the private institutions of risk management, such as insurance and securitization. They have deep experience in smoothing out disasters' effects by sharing them among large numbers of people. The people or entities that are hit hardest are helped by those less badly damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these institutions need ways to deal with such grand-scale issues. Governments should recognize that by giving these businesses a profit incentive to prepare for these unevenly distributed disasters. After all, fire insurance does no good unless you buy it before the house burns down. And you have to diversify your portfolio before the stock market crashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, we aren't too late to take action to insure against some climate risks. And yet this has not been a major element in most of the climate debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already have weather derivatives that can help, like the 50 contracts in 13 countries offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A ski resort can already buy protection against inadequate snowfall and a city can buy protection against too much snowfall next winter by, in effect, taking the opposite side of the same futures contract (through the exchange), thereby pooling their opposite risks. There are also catastrophe bonds, like the three-year, $1.5 billion Everglades Re Ltd. issue sponsored this month by the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation. It would provide relief to the insurer of Floridians hit by a bad hurricane; in such an event, the bond holders would bear losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a problem with instruments like these: They tend to focus on relatively short-term risks, and don't hedge against the increasing cost of disasters over distant future years. Yet if the problems of global warming become more serious, they will very likely be long-lasting, raising some complex, tough-to-quantify issues. Some kinds of crises, like hurricanes, may remain intermittent, but their tendency toward severity may build in a slow, hard-to-predict process and in complex geographical patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychologically, it's hard for most of us to take the initiative on long-term, ill-defined risks. Three scholars -- Howard C. Kunreuther and Mark V. Pauly of the University of Pennsylvania and Stacey McMorrow of the Urban Institute -- show this in their book, ''Insurance and Behavioral Economics: Improving Decisions in the Most Misunderstood Industry'' (Cambridge University Press). But they argue that if we're aware of them, these psychological impediments can be reduced, and they urge the innovation of long-term risk management contracts that address the problem of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some progress is being made: The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility is one recent example of institutional sharing of climate risks. Then there is the Alliance of Small Island States, formed in 1990 as a response to climate&nbsp;change. The group represents 5 percent of the world's population, and its island members are scattered around the globe. But if sea levels rise substantially, all of them will be affected. These countries generally aren't big enough to have a heartland that can help coastal dwellers in a climate catastrophe. The alliance has been arguing for an international approach to dealing with such loss and damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are only beginnings. We have a crucial need to bring innovation to our risk-management institutions. We need to make them flexible, to clarify their long-term international legal status, to develop mechanisms and indexes that can be the basis of long-term risk management contracts and to educate the public about them. Most important, we need concrete action now to build a mechanism that will provide real help for the victims of climate-change disasters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OF the many things being said about climate&nbsp;change lately, none was more eloquent than the point made by Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State in the Showtime series ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' when he observed: ''We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate&nbsp;change and the last generation that can do something about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is how do we motivate people to do something about it at the scale required, when many remain skeptical or preoccupied with the demands of daily life -- and when climate scientists themselves caution that it is impossible to attribute any single weather event to climate&nbsp;change, even if recent weather extremes fit their models of exactly how things will play out as the planet warms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Sullivan's Dish blog last week linked to a very novel approach offered by Thomas Wells, a Dutch philosopher: Since climate&nbsp;change and environmental degradation pit the present against the future, our generation versus those unborn, we should start by giving the future a voice in our present politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Even if we can't know what future citizens will actually value and believe in, we can still consider their interests, on the reasonable assumption that they will somewhat resemble our own (everybody needs breathable air, for example),'' wrote Wells in Aeon Magazine. Since ''our ethical values point one way, towards intergenerational responsibility, but our political system points another, towards the short-term horizon of the next election,'' we ''should consider introducing agents who can vote in a far-seeing and impartial way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells suggests creating a public ''trusteeship'' of nongovernmental civic and charitable foundations, environmental groups and nonpartisan think tanks ''and give them each equal shares of a block of votes adding up to, say, 10 percent of the electorate,'' so they can represent issues like ''de-carbonizing the economy'' and ''guaranteeing pension entitlements'' for the unborn generation that will be deeply impacted but has no vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unrealistic, I know, but the need to incorporate longer time scales into our societal choices is very real -- and right in the lap of our generation. Andy Revkin, who blogs at Dot Earth for The Times's Opinion section, put it well: ''We are coming of age on a finite planet and only just now recognizing that it is finite. So how we manage infinite aspirations of a species that's been on this explosive trajectory, not just of population growth but of consumptive appetite -- how can we make a transition to a stabilized and still prosperous relationship with the Earth and each other -- is the story of our time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to get us to act with an intergenerational perspective is to enlarge the problem beyond climate -- to make people understand that this is our generation's freedom struggle. The abiding strategy of our parents' generation was ''containment'' of communism in order to be free. The abiding strategy of our generation has to be ''resilience.'' We will only be free to live the lives we want if we make our cities, country and planet more resilient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if we can't attribute any particular storm to climate&nbsp;change, by continually pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we are ''loading the dice'' in ways that climate scientists are convinced will continue to raise average temperatures, melt more ice, raise sea levels, warm oceans and make ''normal'' droughts drier, heat waves hotter, rainstorms more violent and the most disruptive storms even more disruptive. It is crazy to keep loading those dice and making ourselves more vulnerable to disruptions that will make us less free to live the lives we want. How free will we be when paying the exorbitant cleanup costs of endless weather extremes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, acting today as if climate&nbsp;change requires an urgent response -- like replacing income and corporate taxes with a carbon tax, introducing a national renewable portfolio standard to constantly stimulate more renewable energy and raising the efficiency standards for every home, building and vehicle -- actually makes us healthier, more prosperous and more resilient, even if climate&nbsp;change turns out to be overblown. We would end up with cleaner air and a tax structure that rewards more of what we want (work and investment) and disincentivizes what we don't want (carbon pollution). We would be taking money away from the worst enemies of freedom on the planet, the world's petro-dictators; and we would be incentivizing our industries to take the lead in manufacturing clean air, water and power systems, which will be in huge demand on a planet going from 7 billion to 9 billion people by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, by taking the climate threat seriously now, we'd make ourselves so much more economically, physically, environmentally and geopolitically resilient -- and, therefore, more free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What containment was for our parents' generation -- their strategy to fight for freedom against the biggest threat of their day -- resiliency will be for our generation against the multiple threats of our day: climate&nbsp;change, petro-dictatorship and destruction of our environment and biodiversity. Let's act so the next generation will want to honor us with a Memorial Day, the way we honor the sacrifice of previous generations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of compensation made available to communities affected by fracking is to be increased in an attempt to counter opposition, the government will say today. The news comes as a report is due to be published estimating that several billion barrels of oil lie in shale rocks beneath southern England.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers will say an average of &pound;800,000 in additional payments will be provided to communities affected by fracking. The announcement shows that the government accepts it must reach out to communities angered by its plan to deny homeowners the right to use trespass laws to contest fracking developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department for Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change will announce a new payment of about &pound;20,000 for each lateral well at fracking sites. The average site will have 10 wells, each with four lateral wells, making the average total &pound;800,000. The payments are on top of the existing compensation system, under which communities are to be given a lump sum of &pound;100,000 when a test well is fracked, plus 1% of revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a study due to be published today, the British Geological Survey (BGS) is expected to say there are large shale gas reserves in Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. But according to reports, the BGS will say it remains to be seen whether extracting them is economically viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron is an avid supporter of fracking for shale gas. Ministers claim the process could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs. Environmental activists are bitterly opposed to the technique, which they say can cause small earthquakes and pollute water supplies, and which they believe will accelerate climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron has blamed a lack of understanding of the process for some of the opposition. The government is preparing to introduce changes to the trespass laws that would make it easier to begin fracking. A government figure insisted that local people would still be consulted, but that a few objectors would not be able to stand in the way, according to the Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said: &quot;If planning permission is granted above ground, we cannot allow a small number of people to delay the agreed development by trying to wrap the pipes in reams of red tape below ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Greatrex, the shadow energy minister, told the Daily Telegraph: &quot;The timing of these announcements will strike many people as cynically and deliberately driven for a day when focus will be on election performance, and ahead of the count of the European elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say the technology is available to switch to a low-carbon economy within years. So what's the hold up? Simon Birch finds out</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest dire warnings from the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate&nbsp;change again conclude that if the world is going to avoid meltdown then we need to move to renewable energy sources pretty sharpish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in the UK, with less than 5% of our energy needs met by renewables, we're still a long way from the official target of producing even 15% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020. The good news is that there's an increasing number of reports, roadmaps and studies which all share the vision that the UK can obtain the majority of its energy from renewables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWF-UK, for example, concludes that by 2030 up to 90% of our electricity could come from a combination of solar, tidal, wind and other sustainable sources, with the rest supplied via an international supergrid and gas power stations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just the UK that could look forward to a low-carbon future; Europe could meet at least 80% of its energy needs from renewables by 2050 without paying more for electricity than it would under the current fossil-fuel based infrastructure, according to the European Climate Foundation. But just how realistic are these targets and, crucially, will they ever attract the support of both government and industry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These goals are most definitely achievable,&quot; concludes Paul Ekins, a member of the energy systems team at the UK Energy Research Centre. &quot;The technologies are there, and enough of them have already been rolled out at scale in different countries for us to be clear that they work and that they can generate the power that we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alistair Cameron, renewable energy campaigner at Friends Of the Earth, agrees: &quot;We can definitely do this. We're on the verge of a massive technological transformation in the renewable energy sector, and the costs of solar and other renewable technologies are already rapidly falling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the positive attitudes, a voice of caution comes from an unexpected corner. &quot;Although future scoping is helpful for showing what's technically possible,&quot; says Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, the trade body for the UK's renewables industry, &quot;100% renewables by 2050 is not something we are calling for. Expanding renewable energy is very important, but calling for too much, too soon, when governments have so many other priorities, will not get you very far. The key thing is to keep the momentum going and the industry growing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So though a low carbon future looks technically possible, could it ever receive the necessary political support to make it a reality? With senior Tories muttering about a possible moratorium on onshore windfarms, it looks unlikely. &quot;The single biggest block to rolling out renewables is a lack of political will. The renewable industry needs a strong signal that we're serious about a low-carbon future,&quot; says Professor Ekins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Cameron, we have neither the necessary ambition nor vision as a nation to make renewable technologies mainstream. &quot;We need to make a strong case for a renewable future in terms of clean air, carbon reduction and green jobs to people, communities and the UK as a whole,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reading the government's support for renewables can be a tricky business. Skorupska describes the &quot;renewable heat incentive&quot; - a world first - as a &quot;terrific work&quot;, but warns that the same administration is also undermining its own work. &quot;It [the coalition] has also taken regressive steps, such as limiting support for biomass power, failing to set out a plan for renewable transport and taking an often negative approach to onshore wind. Its reluctance to support the EU's 2030 renewables targets is telling, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy industry is itself divided over the transition to a low carbon economy. Diversification of the energy market, and the providers that supply it, is clearly a pressure point for the main players. &quot;If we move to a renewable world, then this will have a mix of large- and small-scale projects. This means that more companies will be able to enter the market creating more competition from the likes of renewable energy companies such as Ecotricity and Good Energy - which is clearly a threat to the big six,&quot; says Nick Molho, head of energy policy at WWF-UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skorupska believes that our big energy companies have yet to step up to the challenges of a low-carbon future: &quot;Despite some impressive investments in renewables, especially in wind and biomass, renewables are still very much periphery activities for most of the major utilities,&quot; she adds. &quot;Renewables should be at the heart of any plans for low-carbon energy generation because they are the only proven low-carbon technologies that are actually getting cheaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of future investment will come from new market entrants, such as farmers, businesses, and communities investing in on-site and local renewable energy generation, [but] we need to take the utilities with us as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paper says several billion barrels of oil may lie under Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire - but may not be recoverable</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has been accused of cynically releasing a report that says several billion barrels of oil reserves are under large swaths of southern England a day after the European and local elections in order to bury controversial news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-awaited report by the British Geological Survey (BGS) concludes that &quot;a reasonable central estimate for shale oil is 4.4bn barrels in the ground&quot; in the Weald basin - an area which lies under Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. The top estimate is 8.5bn barrels of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report concludes there is &quot;unlikely to be any shale gas potential&quot; under the region because the oil reserves are not definitely recoverable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is likely to cause alarm in Tory heartlands. The chancellor George Osborne's father-in-law, Lord Howell, has said fracking should not take place in the south and would lead to the loss of thousands of Tory votes. The Weald basin includes the South Downs national park and several areas of outstanding national beauty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to counter such concerns the government has also set out additional compensation for communities affected by the controversial technique. It has proposed a voluntary &quot;community payment of [#xfffd]20,000 per lateral well&quot; in order to &quot;simplify deep underground access for shale gas and geothermal industries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also wants to speed up shale companies' ability to get access to land. The current process is &quot;time-consuming, uncertain and costly&quot;. It says: &quot;If we did nothing to address this issue, the commercial exploitation of shale gas and oil in Great Britain is unlikely to develop in a timely manner, or at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy minister Michael Fallon denied he was disappointed that the BGS report said there was no shale gas in the Weald. &quot;It is not a let-down or a let-up ... I am not disappointed or happy. It is what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if shale had been overhyped, he said: &quot;Not by the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour and environment campaigners the accused the government of trying to bury controversial news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex told the Telegraph: &quot;The timing of these announcements will strike many people as cynically and deliberately driven for a day when focus will be on election performance, and ahead of the count of the European elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of the Earth agreed. Its south-east England campaigner Brenda Pollack said: &quot;These latest estimates will set alarm bells ringing across the south-east of England where fracking firms seem intent on punching holes in some of Britain's most beautiful countryside in the search for profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No wonder the government waited until after the elections to make this announcement as Lord Howell recently warned that fracking will cost the Tories thousands of votes in their heartlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shale oil and gas are not the solution to the UK's energy challenges. Rather than drilling for more dirty fossil fuels that will add to climate&nbsp;change, the government should be backing renewable power and energy efficiency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BGS has already found large reserves of shale gas in the north and has now completed a months-long survey of the extent of it in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous similar reports in the US have had to be revised considerably after further exploration and analysis. Previous estimates of recoverable oil in the Monterey shale reserves in California of about 15.4bn barrels, for example, have turned out to be overstated. A revised estimate from the US Energy Information Administration cut the figure by 96% to 600m barrels of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside the report, the Department of Energy and Climate&nbsp;Change will announce a new payment of about [#xfffd]20,000 for each lateral well at fracking sites. The average site will have 10 wells, each with four lateral wells, making the average total [#xfffd]800,000. The payments are on top of the existing compensation system, under which communities are to be given a lump sum of [#xfffd]100,000 when a test well is fracked, plus 1% of revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron, who is due to announce the new compensation package, has insisted fracking will be &quot;good for our country&quot; and has blamed a lack of understanding of the process for some of the opposition. Ministers claim the process could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs. Environmental activists are bitterly opposed to the technique, which they say can cause small earthquakes and pollute water supplies. They also argue that it is wrong to exploit new fossil fuel reserves when scientists say that existing conventional reserves are more than can be burned without risking dangerous climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is also preparing to introduce changes to the trespass laws that would make it easier to begin fracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said fracking would not bring down energy bills as the gas or oil exploited would be sold on European markets and not used in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told BBC2's Newsnight: &quot;Even the boss of [the fracking firm] Cuadrilla has said fracking in Britain would not reduce energy prices. [The economist] Lord Stern has called it baseless economics and that's because here in the UK if we frack in the UK we don't actually use that gas or oil in the UK. It gets sold on European markets at the going price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's very different from the States where because it's a much bigger country and they are less locked into those bigger world markets they use their own gas and oil as they frack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the experts, even the people who are in the forefront of the fracking ideology are saying actually that it's not going to lead to lower prices, so if you want lower prices you need to go down the renewable route.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Crippling fossil fuel dependency, climate volatility, rocketing debt levels are propelling protests, radicalising the state</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military coups in Thailand are nothing new. But the latest seizure of power by army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha underscores the risks to democracy when governments consistently fail to deal adequately with the complex convergence of systemic crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Chan-ocha has said he is merely seeking to &quot;restore order&quot; in reaction to escalating protests that have seen the deaths of 28 and injury of 700, informed observers point out that the declaration of martial law appears to have been calculated to benefit the coup instigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, the opportunity to impose authoritarian rule has emerged in the context of escalating political instability. But few recognise that the driving force of this instability is not simply 'political infighting', but the inexorable intersection of global trends that affect us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, a prescient editorial in Thailand's English language daily, The Nation, noted that global economic growth was indelibly tied to the abundant availability of cheap oil. Pointing out the links between domestic oil scarcity in countries like Egypt beset with surging social upheaval, the editorial diagnosed the problem as follows:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recent sharp rise in food prices has triggered riots in Egypt and other less-developed countries. Higher energy prices have also added on to the inflationary pressure. The poor are the most vulnerable sector to fluctuations in food and energy prices. Governments thus have to come up with subsidy measures for food and energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this imply for Thailand? The editorial continued:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Thai inflation rate is very sensitive to higher oil prices, which will drive up local transport and production costs. As a heavy importer of energy, the rising oil price could derail the Thai economy and drain our reserves if we're not careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Thailand is a net energy importer. As Southeast Asia's second-largest consumer of energy, with total domestic consumption at 108.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE), the slow demise of cheap energy sources exacerbated by rising demand from India and China has posed a growing challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thailand's Ministry of Energy has not been entirely asleep at the wheel. In 2003, a government report acknowledged that the country's &quot;high dependency on imported energy will make Thailand at risk of energy supply disruption and volatility of energy prices, apart from a substantial foreign currency loss for the imports of energy.&quot; The report urged the government to embark on a strategy to diversify energy supply sources and ramp up domestic renewable energy investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the pace of transition has been too slow, with &quot;little change to the status quo&quot; - and so far the poor, especially rural farmers who have played an increasing role in recent protests, have been most affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to call a spade a spade: Thailand's deteriorating economy is driven significantly by its fossil fuel dependence. In 2013, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that Thailand's economy was especially vulnerable to external shocks, disruptions to its energy supplies and oil price escalation. High international oil prices would push up the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's happening now. Thailand's Ministry of Commerce stated that the CPI had risen by 2.11% in March due to &quot;increases in food and energy prices&quot; rising further to 2.45% in April. The prices underpinning inflation in particular affected &quot;rice, pork, cooking gas and vegetable oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the future. The IEA also projected that Thai energy consumption in Thailand will rise by 75% over the next two decades, corresponding to a dramatic increase in its oil import bill, which could climb to $70bn - three times the current level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also to blame for current inflation are &quot;higher electricity rates and a weaker baht&quot;, along with &quot;droughts in some areas&quot; that could result in &quot;shortages of agricultural products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erratic climate impacts on Thailand are already playing havoc with the economy. Between 1981 and 2007, annual mean temperature in Thailand rose by 1C. Over the last 50 years, the frequency and levels of precipitation have decreased, even while scientists expect that this will accompany an increase in intensity of extreme weather, storm surges and floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is undermining Thailand's position as one of the world's largest rice exporters. Over 40% of Thai citizens depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Widespread floods in October 2010 affecting almost three million people led to a loss in rice production of about 0.7 million tonnes. Droughts in the same years sunk water levels to 15% of their total capacity, also debilitating rice production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devastation caused by flooding in 2011 led to a halt in planned government expenditures, slashing domestic consumption which accounts for about half of economic output. The flooding also destroyed 14% of rice paddies. This increased economic pressure on government to remunerate affected farmers and back an unsustainable 'rice mortgage scheme' guaranteeing higher-than-market prices to export rice. The result of that, coupled with competition with other major rice exporters, has been a decline in rice exports and a drop in government revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rice programme has benefited mostly rich farmers while miring the government in increasing debt, impoverished farmers excluded from the dividends have increasingly seen little choice but to take to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with these burgeoning economic challenges, struggling farmers, as well as low wage workers, have also ended up mired in debt. Since the 2008 financial crisis, there has been an explosion of private borrowing, such that Thailand's ratio of household debt to GDP has increased from 55 per cent to 80 per cent since 2009. As rampant debt, fuelled by rising living costs (underpinned in turn by energy inflation), has stoked political grievances and economic uncertainty, unemployment is pitched to rise to 600,000 - the highest in a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent research has shown that high-debt countries suffer from lower economic growth. In particular large levels of household debt drag growth down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such accelerating debt is widening Thai inequality. The top 10 per cent of landowners in Thailand own 61 per cent of total title land. The income share of the most affluent 20% of the population is about 54% compared to only 5% among the poorest 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 2006 coup, economic gains made by the previous Thaksin administration's rejection of failed IMF reforms have been reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top this off with the interlinked challenges of Thailand's domestic energy scarcity and intensifying climate woes, and we have all the makings of a perfect storm of systemic crises. Any government operating within the framework of conventional 'neoliberal austerity' wisdom - let alone one beleaguered with corruption - would have difficulties managing this scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating within the conventional framework which sees each problem as separate, and reacts belatedly to political disturbances on the shallow surface of current affairs, we can't see the forest for the trees. Thailand's crisis is about more than internal corruption, political repression and economic mismanagement - though all three of course feature in large degree. This is about the unravelling of a global paradigm of fossil fuel dependency and endless growth for its own sake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thailand's latest authoritarian turn is a warning to us all. Until we are ready to work together to address the structural and systemic context of such interconnected crises, we risk rendering the reactionary resort to state-militarisation an inevitable 'final solution' to keep the lid on a new age of unrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us simply don't see ourselves in the melting ice, and the hockey-stick graphs - what can framing offer us?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change is a scientific fact, and increasingly a lived human experience. But it is not yet what sociologists call &quot;a social fact&quot;. It's not an integral part of the way we shape our social practices, nor a significant enough cultural norm to act as a constraint on our behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signifiers of climate&nbsp;change are part of the problem; we are supposed to see ourselves in the melting ice, the plaintive polar bears and the hockey-stick graphs, but most of us simply don't. There has been a fundamental failure in the way in which the idea of climate&nbsp;change has been communicated, based on a misunderstanding both of human nature and the systemic nature of the challenge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What climate&nbsp;change means - and by extension how we should collectively mobilise a meaningful response to it - remains stubbornly stuck, like a broken record, on a problematic vision of The Science translating into a comically generic injunction for Action, with most of the difficult ethical, cultural, political and economic questions left implicit, for policymakers to work out, as if they were equipped for such a task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As argued in a recent Royal Society of Arts (RSA) report a major cause and consequence of this inertia is that even those who broadly accept the facts of climate&nbsp;change struggle to see themselves either as part of the problem or the solution. No wonder then that our societal response has been lacking precisely those personal qualities - passion, honesty, tenacity, and vision - that the issue demands of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Framing&quot; is rapidly becoming a buzzword in debates about climate&nbsp;change, and will not by itself keep fossil fuels in the ground. But we do need a way of thinking and speaking that captures the fact that climate&nbsp;change is not merely one of many environmental problems, but a completely unique collective action problem, and one that is implicated in every aspect of our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As previously argued by Jonathan Rowson we need a framing that is complex enough to highlight the competing commitments (eg to energy security, fuel prices, and economic growth) that militate against many forms of action, but also one that's simple enough to be a shared reference point. A systematic unpacking of the relationship between these Seven Dimensions of climate&nbsp;change: science, technology, law, economy, democracy, culture, behaviour, is our attempt to satisfy both these constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major new collaboration by the RSA and the Climate Outreach &amp; Information Network (COIN), funded by the Climate&nbsp;Change Collaboration, will catalyse a series of conversations about how we might use this framing to help develop, in effect, a social identity for climate&nbsp;change. The aim is to begin weaving a network of representatives from across these diverse backgrounds and convene a series of seven public events at the RSA exploring the interaction between them, leading to a final report in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't capture the full range of potential interactions in this post, but here are a few pointers on what might we expect from such discussions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every dimension has a strong claim to fundamentality - and they are all right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much of our legitimate fear stems from the models, measurements, probabilities and predictions of climate science as our most objective reference point and shared touchstone. But so much of our hope rests in the applied sciences of technology to, for instance, make renewable energy at scale feasible, affordable and swift. Even the most hardened techno-optimist will recognise that we also need law, to give us regulations without which we can't get national and international incentives for technological development or constraints on fossil fuel production at sufficient scale and speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are limits to such constraints though, because the consumption-based growth imperative that shapes the global economy is not going anywhere fast, and there is no long term solution that doesn't factor in a new economic vision. There is little hope of that kind of transformative change happening unless we can mobilise and channel civic and political will in ways that allow us to take sound collective decisions, which means democracy has to deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where will such will and conviction come from if not from media, social media, art, music; the ideas, ideals and visions of culture? And who is going to really 'act' to make all this happen if not people in all these dimensions of their own lives, through changes in their behaviour?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Framing helps broker 'technical solutions' and 'adaptive challenges'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essential but neglected discussions between these two distinct families of approaches can be tackled through framing. By capturing the need both for technical solutions relating to levers that can be pulled within our current system or paradigm (science, technology, law) and adaptive challenges (behaviour, culture, democracy) relating to personal, political and social progress that could potentially yield a more fundamental transformation. Changes in the economy typically feature both technical solutions (eg carbon taxes) and adaptive challenges (eg shorter working weeks) and might be seen as a bridge between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every dimension needs something from the others</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Framing has a holographic quality, in that if you look through a particular lens you begin to see the other dimensions there too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Shell's recent statement (technology) that their business model (economy) relying on fossil fuel extraction remains safe from &quot;the carbon bubble&quot;; a scenario in which current balance sheet assets lose their massive value and become &quot;stranded&quot; as governments respond to explanations and predictions on devastating climatic changes (science) by legislating (law) against the extraction of fossil fuels due to political pressure (democracy). Shell justified themselves on the basis that energy demand is going to keep rising (behaviour) and implicitly on fossil fuels not becoming stigmatised due to the growth of divestment strategies (culture).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewed in this way, investors with an interest in renewable energy technologies would be well advised to get talking to very different kinds of &quot;tribe&quot;, including student divestment movements, and this is just one of many examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something in the seven dimensions for anyone to get their teeth into - this is a way of beginning to think about climate&nbsp;change that invites widespread debate and contestation, not the uniform agreement of a niche minority, which keeps us exactly where we are.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Russia and China Finally Complete 30-Year Gas Deal'' (front page, May 22): The Cold War of the 1940s and '50s set off an arms race. The United States' new cold war against Russia has set off a natural gas race. That Russia is turning to China as a major natural gas customer is hardly surprising, but it is dismaying given the extent of climate change across the planet, which is sure to worsen if fossil fuel use continues at its current levels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ''A Bridge to Nowhere,'' the latest study by Robert W. Howarth of Cornell University, whose 2011 report discussed the significance of methane emissions and the climate-change potential of high volume hydraulic fracturing, both natural gas and shale gas are more powerful global warmers than any other fossil fuel because of the methane emitted in their production and transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All major countries should be uniting to drive for renewable energies. Future generations will pay a terrible price for today's heedless, tragic race to extract the planet's last fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry's over-inflated reserve estimates are unravelling, and with it the 'American dream' of oil independence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish a new estimate of US shale deposits set to deal a death-blow to industry hype about a new golden era of US energy independence by fracking unconventional oil and gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EIA officials told the Los Angeles Times that previous estimates of recoverable oil in the Monterey shale reserves in California of about 15.4 billion barrels were vastly overstated. The revised estimate, they said, will slash this amount by 96% to a puny 600 million barrels of oil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Monterey formation, previously believed to contain more than double the amount of oil estimated at the Bakken shale, and five times larger than the Eagle Ford shale, both in Texas, was slated to add up to 2.8 million jobs by 2020 and boost government tax revenues by $24.6 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry lobbyists have for long highlighted the Monterey shale reserves as the big game-changer for US oil and gas production. Nick Grealy, who runs the consultancy No Hot Air which is funded by &quot;gas and associated companies&quot;, and includes the UK's most high-profile shale gas fracker Cuadrilla among its clients, predicted last year that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... the star of the North American show is barely on most people's radar screens. California shale will... reinvigorate the Golden State's economy over the next two to three years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sort of hype triggered &quot;a speculation boom among oil companies&quot; according to the LA Times. The EIA's original survey for the US Department of Energy published in 2011 had been contracted out to Intek Inc. That report found that the Monterey shale constituted &quot;64 percent of the total shale oil resources&quot; in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EIA's revised estimate was based partly on analysis of actual output from wells where new fracking techniques had been applied. According to EIA petroleum analyst John Staub:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the information we've been able to gather, we've not seen evidence that oil extraction in this area is very productive using techniques like fracking... Our oil production estimates combined with a dearth of knowledge about geological differences among the oil fields led to erroneous predictions and estimates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Intek Inc study for the EIA had relied largely on oil industry claims, rather than proper data. Hitesh Mohan, who authored the Intek study for the EIA, reportedly conceded that &quot;his figures were derived from technical reports and presentations from oil companies, including Occidental Petroleum, which owns the lion's share of oil leases in the Monterey Shale, at 1.6 million acres.&quot; Mohan had even lifted his original estimate for the EIA to 17 billion barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoscientist David Hughes, who worked for the Geological Survey of Canada for 32 years, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oil had always been a statistical fantasy. Left out of all the hoopla was the fact that the EIA's estimate was little more than a back-of-the-envelope calculation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Post Carbon Institute (PCI) published Hughes' study, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Drilling California: A Reality Check on the Monterey Shale</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which conducted an empirical analysis of oil production data using a widely used industry database also relied on by the EIA. The report concluded that the original EIA estimate was &quot;highly overstated,&quot; and unlikely to lead to a &quot;statewide economic boom.... California should consider its economic and energy future in the absence of an oil production boom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Institute, Tod Brilliant, told me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the incredible difference between initial projections of 15 billion barrels and revisions to 600 million, does this not call into account all such global projections for tight oil?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I'd reported earlier in June last year, a wider PCI study by Hughes had come to similar conclusions about bullish estimates of US shale oil and gas potential, concluding that &quot;light tight oil production in the USA will peak between 2015 and 2017, followed by a steep decline&quot;, while shale gas production would likely peak next year. In that post, I'd pointed out previous well-documented, and alarmingly common, cases of industry over-estimates of reserve sizes which later had been questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts like Jeremy Leggett have said, citing exaggerated oil industry estimates, that if reserve and production reality are indeed significantly lower than industry forecasts, we could be at risk of an oil shock as early as within the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest revelations follow a spate of bad news for industry reassurances about the fracking boom. New research published this month has found that measured methane leaks from fracking operations were three times larger than forecasted. The US Environment Protection Agency therefore &quot;significantly underestimates&quot; methane emissions from fracking, by as much as a 100 to a 1,000 times according to a new Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study published in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press also reported, citing a Government Accountability Office investigation, that the US Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management had failed to adequately inspect thousands of oil and gas wells that are potentially high risk for water and environmental damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the mounting evidence that the shale gas boom is heading for a bust, both economically and environmentally, both governments and industry are together pouring their eggs into a rather flimsy basket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a secret trade memo obtained by the Huffington Post, the Obama administration and the European Union are pushing ahead with efforts to &quot;expand US fracking, offshore oil drilling and natural gas exploration&quot;, as well as exports to the EU, under the prospective Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist from California, wants to blast the issue of climate&nbsp;change to the front lines of American politics. His ''super PAC,'' NextGen Climate, will spend about $100 million this year to influence several Senate and governor's races in which climate&nbsp;change could play a major role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the goal, Mr. Steyer's strategists say, is to pave the way for climate&nbsp;change to become a major issue in the next presidential campaign, by elevating it in the minds of voters in states that will play crucial roles in nominating and electing the next president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer's organization will pour money into media campaigns to influence Senate races in Iowa, New Hampshire, Colorado and Michigan, and governors' races in Pennsylvania, Florida and Maine. They will back candidates who openly embrace climate&nbsp;change policies in an effort to help them defeat those who question or deny the established science of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer hopes those tactics will create a political landscape in which candidates fear that they will be politically punished for questioning that science. To coordinate the effort, Mr. Steyer has hired Chris Lehane, a veteran Democratic strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want 2014 to be a pivot year for climate -- the year we can demonstrate that you can use climate&nbsp;change as a wedge issue to win in political races,'' Mr. Lehane said Wednesday at a briefing with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lehane declined to name an exact figure, but he said that Mr. Steyer had already pledged to spend $50 million of his own fortune on the effort, while NextGen Climate has committed to raising $50 million more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's strategy expands on successful efforts by Mr. Steyer to elevate climate&nbsp;change issues in three 2013 races. He and NextGen spent over $11 million to influence the Virginia governor's race, with the intent of defeating Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a Republican who questions the science of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry McAuliffe, the winning Democratic candidate, was not known as a major champion of climate policy, but he campaigned against Mr. Cuccinelli as out-of-touch and a turnoff for potential businesses seeking to invest in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The race in 2013 in Virginia was a beta test for 2014,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''It provided us the political paradigm to model our other races off of.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate policies have traditionally been a tough campaign issue for candidates. A mounting stack of scientific evidence has concluded that human activities -- particularly burning coal and oil for electricity and transportation -- are trapping heat in the atmosphere and leading to dangerous food and water shortages, increasing droughts and deluges, and potentially devastating sea-level rises. But Many American voters remain unconvinced that the science is real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2010, Republican campaigns have attacked Democrats who support climate policies to cut carbon pollution as backing a ''war on coal'' and ''job-killing regulations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kind of language is likely to escalate after June 2, when President Obama is expected to announce a climate&nbsp;change regulation intended to slash pollution from coal-fired power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles and David Koch, billionaire industrialist brothers, have put millions of dollars into advocacy groups and super PACs like Americans for Prosperity, which have campaigned aggressively against lawmakers who support climate&nbsp;change policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The left knows that the global warming agenda is a loser for them with the American people,'' Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview. Mr. Phillips said that none of the four most vulnerable Democratic senators -- Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas -- had embraced climate&nbsp;change policy. All four support construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which Mr. Steyer opposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Senators up for re-election have their sneakers on and are running from this,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''They know the issue doesn't matter with most Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one expert said Mr. Steyer's tactic may work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Independent voters, with regard to the issue of climate&nbsp;change, track much more closely with Democrats than Republicans,'' said Edward Maibach, the director of the Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Communication at George Mason University. ''Painting candidates as climate deniers stands a good chance of working in districts where the vote turns on independents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steyer's group hopes to be helped by the National Climate Assessment, a new scientific report that details the ways climate&nbsp;change is already causing economic harm across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Senate race in Michigan, Mr. Steyer's group will back Representative Gary Peters, a Democrat who says he will make a point of highlighting how climate&nbsp;change is lowering water levels and leading to environmental problems in the Great Lakes, while also threatening Michigan's agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's important to frame the issue in terms of potential threats to our state,'' Mr. Peters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, NextGen will spend to defeat Gov. Rick Scott, who has openly questioned the science of climate&nbsp;change. Charlie Crist, a Democratic challenger and former Republican, has cited skepticism of climate&nbsp;change as one of the reasons he left the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida voters will play a crucial role in the 2016 election. The state is home to two possible Republican presidential contenders -- Senator Marco Rubio, who has questioned the science of climate&nbsp;change, and former Gov. Jeb Bush, who has evaded specific questions on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iowa, NextGen will back Representative Bruce Braley, a Democratic candidate for the Senate who voted for a House climate&nbsp;change bill in 2009. The group will attack Mr. Braley's potential Republican opponents, State Senator Joni Earnst or Mark Jacobs, a former electric energy company executive, by criticizing claims they have made questioning climate science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Maine's three-way governor's race, Mr. Steyer's group hopes to unseat the Republican incumbent, Paul R. LePage, who has said that climate&nbsp;change could bring economic opportunity to his state, as melting ice in the Northeast Passage opened up shipping routes, and warmer winters could attract tourists to Maine year-round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, the group will back Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat who has vocally supported climate and clean energy policies, against Representative Cory Gardner, who has questioned the science of climate&nbsp;change. In the Pennsylvania governor's race, NextGen will back Tom Wolf, a Democrat, against the Republican incumbent, Tom Corbett, who in an interview this month called the science of climate&nbsp;change ''a subject of debate.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: The Abbott government's first budget was the least popular and most extreme in forty years, and was handed down during an almost unprecedented May heatwave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By most accounts, the first budget of the Abbott government was the least popular and most extreme in forty years, and was handed down during an almost unprecedented May heatwave of ten consecutive days above 20 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pantomime of the federal budget took place in Australia last Tuesday, auspiciously on the 13th of May. As a piece of political theatre, the budget is generally viewed as one of the most important set pieces&nbsp;of the year&nbsp;by political and media elites. The accepted wisdom is that the budget is an opportunity for the government to set the agenda for the remainder of the year. If this is true, then the Abbott government has sent a strong message that its agenda is resolutely regressive for&nbsp;almost every policy area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the climate and environment front, it is genuinely difficult to narrow down the most extreme elements of this deeply and widely disliked budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, the fact is that this is a deeply unpopular budget, and it has been presented to the Australian people by a government that is neither liked nor trusted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get an idea of just how unpopular this budget is, you could look at opinion polls, such as the recent Newspoll which shows only 5 percent of respondents saying they would be better off. Snap protests against the budget were also held, events which were well covered by The Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or you could watch this video of&nbsp;what happened when people on the street get told about the &quot;best budget ever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the scale of the betrayal in this budget is breathtaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to social policy attacks against Australia's most vulnerable people, including $80 billion in cuts to health and education, and the regressive proposal to introduce a $7 fee to see a doctor, the budget destroys the Abbott government's final claims to take climate&nbsp;change seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are scores of programs and policies that have been trashed by Tony Abbott and his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A particularly egregious&nbsp;cut is the abolition of ARENA, the renewable energy agency. This action is a loud declaration that the Abbott government is addicted to carbon-intensive energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tied to &nbsp;this, although not a budget initiative, is the review of the previously bi-partisan Renewable Energy Target, with climate denier Dick Warburton appointed as review head. Before the election, there were clear statements made that an Abbott government would continue to support the renewable energy target. Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said before the election that the Coalition &quot;does&nbsp;agree on the renewable energy target&quot; and &quot;support the&nbsp;RET, the 20 per cent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cut to ARENA and the review of Australia's renewable energy target is a breathtaking assault on the $18 billion renewable energy sector, and introduces substantial elements of sovereign risk for companies and people considering investing in this area in Australia. Before last year's election, the Coalition repeatedly promised to keep ARENA. In opposition, the Coalition supported ARENA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clean Energy Council has also expressed major concerns, a rare event for a body that has to keep governments on side. In a statement, the CEC deputy CEO said: &quot;A global race for renewable energy is on, and the removal of ARENA will see potential Australian and international investors now look to countries with much stronger support for renewable energy innovation, meaning we may well miss out on billions of dollars of investment and highly-skilled jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The Coalition had previously promised to remove funding for the Clean&nbsp;Energy Finance Corporation, an ideologically motivated decision based on Abbott's view that it was &quot;socialism masquerading as environmentalism&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other renewable and clean energy programs have also been scrapped, such as the One Million Solar Roofs program, research into carbon capture and storage technology, the Clean Technology Program, the Cleaner Fuels grant scheme, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a real risk that the result of the RET review will see the end of the renewable energy target, once a bi-partisan policy. Removing or reducing the renewable energy target, currently 20 percent by 2020, would effectively lock Australia to a carbon-intensive, fossil fuel addicted future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change remains a serious and present threat to Australia's society and economy. Major global economic forces are moving to clean energy and low carbon technologies. China for example is planning to triple its solar capacity by 2017, and other major economies including US states and nations in the EU are heading in that direction also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do nothing about climate&nbsp;change, as the Australian government now appears committed to, is immoral and amounts to abandoning both current and future generations. Australia's social compact has been built around the government ensuring safety, prosperity and freedom; the cuts to Australia's social safety-net (in the form of $80 billion in cuts to health and education) is doubly cruel when you consider that it is the most vulnerable who are impacted by the effects of global warming. Climate&nbsp;change is a direct threat to Australia's future prosperity and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trashing&nbsp;of Australia's renewable energy sector removes the last pretense that this government would take climate&nbsp;change seriously. No one who accepts the dangers of global warming would destroy their nation's renewable energy capacity, or the fossil fuel industry's incentives to develop carbon capture technology. (The bitter pill is that the Abbott government plans to keep billions of dollars worth of corporate fossil fuel subsidies with the diesel rebate, while increasing the &nbsp;excise for individual motorists.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many other instances in the budget -&nbsp;too many to name&nbsp;- that should leave the Australian public, and the global community, under no doubt that the government is run by climate deniers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear&nbsp;now that the carbon price introduced by the former Labor government must be ferociously defended, and the government's discredited &quot;direct action&quot; policy opposed. As an economic reform, the combination of the trading scheme and a steadily reducing cap on emissions is essential to both reduce Australia's carbon emissions, and to ensure Australia remains a constructive player in global efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen how the new Senate, where coal magnate Clive Palmer holds the balance of power, will act, but it is clear that both Labor and the Greens will block the repeal of the carbon price under the current senate.&nbsp;To its credit, Labor has remained firm in its support for&nbsp;an emissions trading scheme with a cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia sweltered through one of the hottest summers on record, and the winter of 2014 is preparing to match or break heat records. For people who do take global warming seriously, efforts to halt the Australian government's reckless agenda now rests on the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;unseasonably hot May demonstrates yet again the pressing moral urgency of climate action;&nbsp;the assault on the renewable energy sector is yet another symptom of the moral failures of Abbott's government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Looks Like Rain Again. And Again.'' (By Degrees, May 13): Most articles on global warming fail to mention the direct relationship between livestock and climate change. Animal agriculture causes more global warming than all forms of transportation combined. Yet most people, including climate scientists, continue to eat meat, dairy and eggs. What is the point of knowledge if it does not lead to personal change?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El Ni&ntilde;o is coming. Above-average sea surface temperatures have developed off the west coast of South America and seem poised to grow into a full-fledged El Ni&ntilde;o event, in which unusually warm water temperatures spread across the equatorial East Pacific. Models indicate a 75 percent chance of El Ni&ntilde;o this fall, which could bring devastating droughts to Australia or heavy rains to the southern United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over climate&nbsp;change, however, brings additional significance to this round of El Ni&ntilde;o, which will probably increase global temperatures, perhaps to the highest levels ever. It could even inaugurate a new era of more rapid warming, offering vindication to maligned climate models and re-energizing climate activists who have struggled to break through in a polarized political environment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a decade, climate scientists have battled a public-relations challenge: Even though atmospheric temperatures are higher than at any time in the past 4,000 years, surface temperature increases seem to have slowed down since 1998. The planet has gotten warmer over the last decade, but climate&nbsp;change skeptics have used this so-called hiatus or pause in warming to take aim at the accuracy of the climate models, which appeared to predict more significant warming than has so far happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most climate scientists argue that the climate models never predicted steady, uninterrupted warming. Annual global temperatures always rise and fall on either side of the longer-term average, in much the same way that the stocks rise and fall from day to day, even during a strong market. They believe, based on computer simulations of hiatus periods and measurements from new floating sensors, they can account for the ''missing'' heat, much of which they believe is deep in the ocean, more than 700 meters below the water's surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the hiatus helped climate-change skeptics earn mainstream adherents last year, as global temperatures hung perilously close to falling beneath even the lowest model projections. ''Apocalypse perhaps a little later,'' as The Economist put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some evidence that the number of Americans who don't believe in global warming has increased by about 7 percentage points since the pause or hiatus began to gain mainstream news media attention, according to polling data provided by Edward Maibach, the director of the Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Communication at George Mason University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year's El Ni&ntilde;o might represent a turning point. The oscillation between El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a, El Ni&ntilde;o's cold-water cousin, is part of the reason for slower atmospheric warming. Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific rise during El Ni&ntilde;o and ultimately heat up the atmosphere in what Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, calls a ''mini'' global warming event. The reverse happens during La Ni&ntilde;a.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shifts between El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a offer an elegant explanation for at least some or perhaps most of the slowdown in atmospheric warming. The hiatus is said to have begun in 1998, just after the historic El Ni&ntilde;o of 1997 and early 1998. La Ni&ntilde;a has often prevailed since then, cooling the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of El Ni&ntilde;o is likely to increase global temperatures. Mr. Trenberth believes it is ''reasonable'' to expect that 2015 will be the warmest year on record if this fall's El Ni&ntilde;o event is strong and long enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could make a difference in the battle for public opinion. One-third of Americans don't trust climate scientists, according to Jon Krosnick of Stanford University, and they make their decisions about climate&nbsp;change ''based on very recent trends in warming.'' Belief in warming jumps when global temperatures hit record highs; it drops in cooler years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As El Ni&ntilde;o returns heat from the oceans to the atmosphere, the ensuing spike in global surface temperatures could earn considerable news media attention, especially if record-setting global temperatures coincide with the extreme weather events typically brought by El Ni&ntilde;o.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But El Ni&ntilde;o has the potential to do more than offer a one-time jolt to climate activists. It could unleash a new wave of warming that could shape the debate for a decade, or longer. In this chain of events, a strong El Ni&ntilde;o causes a shift in a longer cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which favors more frequent and intense El Ni&ntilde;os during its ''warm'' or ''positive'' phase. The oscillation has been ''negative'' or ''cool'' since the historic El Ni&ntilde;o of 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate scientists don't fully understand the exact mechanics of this phenomenon. ''But the suspicion is certainly that it is related to El Ni&ntilde;no events,'' Mr. Trenberth said. ''The switch to the current negative phase was probably triggered by the 97-98 El Ni&ntilde;o.'' The question is whether this fall's El Ni&ntilde;o ''might kick the P.D.O. into a positive phase.'' If it does, a result would be faster warming, at least doubling the rate of surface temperature increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sustained period of faster warming won't convert skeptics into climate&nbsp;change activists. But the accompanying wave of headlines might energize climate&nbsp;change activists and refocus attention on climate&nbsp;change heading into the 2016 presidential election. Those headlines could include landslides in Southern California, or widespread floods across the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing could provide an uncomfortable backdrop for Republican presidential hopefuls who are skeptical of climate&nbsp;change, like Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who recently said he did not believe human activity was causing climate&nbsp;change. Democrats, eager to cast Republicans as anti-science or to appeal to voters in the endangered coastal city of Miami, might be likelier to re-emphasize climate&nbsp;change if polls show an increase in the public's belief in global warming, which Mr. Krosnick anticipates will happen if global temperatures rise to record levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Mr. Krosnick doubts whether higher temperatures would compel more ambitious measures to curb carbon emissions. ''It won't vastly increase pressure on the government to do something.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist, thinks recurring catastrophic events will be necessary to soften the G.O.P.'s position on climate&nbsp;change. Without Republican support, it will be hard for Congress to pass climate legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- Portraying California as the front line of climate&nbsp;change, Gov. Jerry Brown said Monday that the effects of man-made global warming were devastating the state, drawing a direct link between climate&nbsp;change and both the record-setting drought that has left the state parched and the early-season wildfires that broke out across California last week. He declared that people must find a way ''to live with nature, not collide with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that California was at the ''epicenter'' of the impact of climate&nbsp;change, Mr. Brown said that states and nations in general were ''not on a sustainable path'' when it came to global warming and the harsh weather patterns and other problems it brings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have to adapt because the climate is changing,'' Mr. Brown said in a speech to scientists gathered in Sacramento for a conference on the drought's impact on state agriculture. ''Now there's no doubt that the evidence has been strong for quite a while, and it is getting even stronger.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has made battling climate&nbsp;change one of the centerpieces of his tenure, traveling as far as China to marshal support for efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He has pressed for continued enforcement of the state's cap-and-trade program -- which places limits on emissions from major polluters -- despite some critics' calls to scale back amid the weak economy. And he has repeatedly criticized Congress for not doing enough to take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown is at the forefront of governors across the country who are grappling with ways to deal with climate&nbsp;change through legislation and infrastructure changes, rather than waiting for coordinated efforts from the federal government. Governors from states including Maryland, New York and Washington are pushing for ways to combat what they say are dangerous threats to their state's economic and environmental future, citing worries of rising sea levels, drought and snowmelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight states so far have passed legislation calling for the reduction of carbon emissions in the coming decades, though none with plans as ambitious as California's. Nine Northeastern states along with California have adopted cap-and-trade policies for the largest greenhouse-gas-emitting industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington signed an executive order to create a cap-and-trade program similar to California's and updating the state's emission limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is not a hypothetical thing for governors on the West Coast -- this is fire alarms and floods,'' Mr. Inslee said Monday in a telephone interview. ''It's not a next-century issue. This is a next half-hour issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some East Coast leaders have also sounded alarms: In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has praised proposals to improve state utilities to reduce emissions and has begun to issue warnings to investors in the state that climate&nbsp;change poses a long-term risk to the state's finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gathering support from other state and national leaders for stricter environmental regulations has been a cornerstone of Mr. Brown's efforts. This summer, he plans to travel to Mexico as part of a trade mission and plans to press leaders there to sign a pledge to reduce greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California officials are also preparing what many predict will be the worst wildfire season in the state's history. The state plans to spend roughly $242 million on the wildfires this year, but Mr. Brown has warned that it might not be enough in coming years. And the record-level drought this year is expected to cost California's agricultural industry $1.7 billion and cause about 14,500 workers to lose their jobs, according to a forecast released by the University of California, Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to start ''aligning our economy and our way of life in California with the demands of nature as we now understand them scientifically,'' as Mr. Brown put it, he intends by 2025 to have about 1.5 million electric cars on California's roads -- a fraction of the state's 32 million vehicles, but a big step nonetheless. The goal will require cooperation from other states to encourage the purchase of such vehicles. In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Brown said that drivers in the state traveled about 332.3 billion miles last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown added that the state was only ''1 percent'' of the problem globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have to get other states and other nations on a similar path forward,'' he said, ''and that is enormously difficult because it requires different political jurisdiction, different political values, to unite around this one challenge of making a sustainable future.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Sitting in the headquarters of the Wyoming Liberty Group, Susan Gore, founder of the conservative think tank, said new national science standards for schools were a form of ''coercion,'' adding, ''I don't think government should have anything to do with education.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Gore, a daughter of the founder of the company that makes Gore-Tex waterproof fabric, was speaking here weeks after the Republican-controlled Legislature made Wyoming, where coal and oil are king, the first state to reject the standards, which include lessons on human impact on global warming. The pushback came despite a unanimous vote by a group of Wyoming science educators urging acceptance. Wyoming was the first state to say no, but likely not the last. A House committee in Oklahoma last week voted to reject the standards, also in part because of concerns about how climate&nbsp;change would be taught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid a growing cascade of studies documenting melting ice caps and rising temperatures, schools are increasingly teaching students about climate&nbsp;change and the new guidelines, known as the Next Generation Science Standards, have been adopted so far by 11 states and the District of Columbia. They assert that human activity has affected the climate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many here and elsewhere consider that liberal dogma rather than scientific consensus and want their children to hear it as theory rather than fact. What is more, some Wyoming lawmakers say, such teaching is a threat to the state's economic engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standards ''handle global warming as settled science,'' State Representative Matt Teeters, a Republican from Lingle, told The Casper Star-Tribune. ''There's all kind of social implications involved in that, that I don't think would be good for Wyoming.'' Although oil companies like Exxon and Chevron have publicly supported the Next Generation standards, Mr. Teeters told The Star-Tribune that such teaching could wreck the economy of Wyoming, the country's largest energy exporter. Mr. Teeters, who declined requests to elaborate, was joined in his objections by Ron Micheli, chairman of the State Board of Education, who called the standards ''very prejudiced, in my opinion, against fossil fuel development.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy over climate science -- and the question of whether other states will reject the standards -- is in many ways a replay of fights over the teaching of evolution. Opponents say parents and local educators should determine what is taught to children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We question this whole idea of standards reform and the whole idea of nationalized standards,'' said Amy Edmonds, policy analyst at the Wyoming Liberty Group. ''We believe at the heart that it continues to take away parental choice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new standards were developed by 26 state governments and several groups of scientists and teachers. They provide signposts for what students should learn in each grade between kindergarten and high school graduation, but leave decisions about textbooks and how to teach the curriculum to individual districts, schools and educators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wyoming, after 18 months of study and comparison with standards from other states, a committee of science educators unanimously recommended last fall that the State Board of Education adopt the guidelines. In March, at the tail end of the state's legislative session, lawmakers passed a footnote to the biennial budget, prohibiting any public spending to implement the new standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last month, the State Board of Education ordered the committee of science educators to come up with a new set of standards. Mr. Micheli, the chairman and a cattle rancher from Fort Bridger, said he was concerned about any teaching on climate&nbsp;change that did not consider ''the cost-benefit analysis in terms of the expenditure of the effort to bring under control global warming.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other states, the debate is also intense. Last fall, the Legislature in Kentucky voted to reject the new science guidelines but Gov. Steven L. Beshear overruled the Legislature and put the standards in place with an executive order. In South Carolina, state-specific guidelines with watered-down references to climate&nbsp;change and evolution are still awaiting approval by the State Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Wyoming and elsewhere, criticism of the Next Generation standards is also being fueled by a spreading backlash against national academic standards in general. Across the country, opponents on the right and left have attacked the Common Core, a separately developed set of standards for what elementary, middle and high school students should know and be able to do in reading and math, and that have been adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an election for governor this year, opposing the standards is ''becoming a political litmus test,'' said Richard Barrans, a science education professor at the University of Wyoming who served on the state's standards review committee. ''Are you enough of an independent, antigovernment person?'' He added that the role of humans in climate&nbsp;change is only a small part of the science standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even educators who identify themselves as conservative said they saw no problem with the standards. Walter Hushbeck, a high school science teacher in Cheyenne who served on the standards review committee, said that critics of the standards were ''bullies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Gov. Matt Mead has made clear that he is skeptical of national science standards for Wyoming. Cindy Hill, the state's superintendent of education, who is running against Mr. Mead in the August Republican primary with Tea Party support, declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the standards are incensed by what has happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Political realities should not wag the dog of science,'' said Marguerite Herman, a lobbyist for the American League of Women Voters in Wyoming and a member of Wyoming for Science Education, a group of parents and educators. ''We acknowledge and appreciate the revenue that has been raised and that runs this state from oil and gas extraction and from the coal mining, and it is a fact that our schools are well funded because of it. Nevertheless, it doesn't change a scientific fact.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Wyoming school districts have already adopted the Next Generation standards on their own. In Goshen County, the heart of cattle and sugar beet country, for example, science teachers have been developing curriculum around the standards for the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Spears, science facilitator for the school district, said he liked the guidelines because they promoted scientific inquiry and allowed flexibility at the local level. ''We're not trying to be controversial about it,'' Mr. Spears said. ''The majority of us will present evidence. That's what the scientific method is all about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent morning at Southeast Elementary School in Yoder, a speck on the map about 75 miles north of Cheyenne, Mr. Spears, wearing his signature tie-dye lab coat, used an electrostatic generator to make a student's hair stand on end and showed how a bicycle pump could make a puddle of water and some smoke bloom into an instant cloud inside a five-gallon glass jug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many jobs in the state dependent on science and technology, Mr. Spears said, it was important that Wyoming students got the best science curriculum. ''Do you want our kids, or do you want other people to come and take those jobs?'' he asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Van Housen had a question. What he wanted to know from the 30 or so other Nebraska farmers and ranchers gathered in February at the York Community Center was this: What do you do with 10,000 dead cows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the number of cattle Van Housen figured could be at risk if the Obama administration permitted the proposed 1,700-mile XL leg of the Keystone pipeline to cut across their state. Bulldozers would dig a trench not far from Van Housen's feedlot, completing the final phase of the Keystone project and streamlining the current flow of oil from the bitumen mines of Northern Alberta toward refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. If the pipe were to leak, Van Housen said, his cattle could die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Can we put [those cows] on trucks and send them to Canada?'' suggested Max Nelson, a stooped retired rancher who raised his hand every 10 minutes to pose other hypothetical disasters: a spill polluting the water supply of West Omaha, say, or compromising the hydroelectric dams on the Platte River.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trans&shy;Canada, the $48 billion Canadian company that owns the Keystone, has repeatedly said the XL will be ''the safest pipeline ever built on U.S. soil,'' a technological marvel with automatic shut-off valves and satellite monitoring. The exact composition of what will flow through the pipeline is not publicly available, but it will include bitumen -- a thick, semisolid petroleum product -- blended with natural gas that has been pressurized to become a liquid. If the line is approved, it could carry 830,000 barrels a day of this ''diluted bitumen'' across Nebraska, over 275 miles and through 515 private properties. No one knows exactly what a leak would do, but evidence from past malfunctions suggests catastrophe. In 2010, a spill from Enbridge's Line 6B dropped 840,000 gallons of bitumen to the bottom of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. Four years and more than a billion dollars later, the cleanup continues. Last spring, Exxon's Pegasus line burst near a residential area of Mayflower, Ark., spreading 210,000 gallons of bitumen through neighborhood streets, causing evacuations and leaving residents complaining of respiratory problems, nausea and headaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the farmers in the York Community Center was a petite, progressive organizer with close-cropped hair named Jane Kleeb (pronounced Klehb). She was the reason they were there. The fight over the Keystone XL has largely been portrayed as one about climate change, in which environmental groups like the National Wildlife Federation and 350.org are pitted against the fossil-fuel industry. But what has kept the pipeline out of the ground so far, more than anything, has been Kleeb's ability to convince mostly&shy; conservative farmers and ranchers that they are the ones being asked to bear all the risk of Canada's energy expansion. If something goes wrong, she says, they're the ones who are going to suffer. Kleeb didn't need to persuade all of the people in the room to be angry -- many of the state's landowners are plenty wary of what they see as the pipeline's risks -- but she has organized them to take on Trans&shy;Canada and more or less their state's entire political power structure. Days earlier, thanks to her efforts, a state district court had thrown the construction into limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleeb's route to rural activism was not a predictable one. Born Jane Fleming, she was raised in a Catholic family in exurban South Florida, where her mother was a staunch Republican and the head of Broward County Right to Life. Her early childhood was spent going to candlelight vigils and making signs for anti-abortion&shy; rallies, and the absolutist approach to activism that she learned as a girl filled a deep need as she became an adolescent. She struggled with anorexia throughout her teens, she said, and community service was one of the few things that gave her life a sense of meaning. ''There were times when service literally kept me alive,'' she told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, her involvement with community-aid groups pulled her out of the Republican Party. In 2004, at 30, she pitched to the Young Democrats of America a proposal to organize young voters using grass-roots techniques. ''Our belief was that one punk kid talking to another punk kid would be more likely to believe a message than if some preppy kid came to their door,'' she said. The Young Democrats hired her as its executive director, and in 2005, as she was preparing for its quarterly meeting in Phoenix, a contact asked if a Democratic House candidate from Nebraska could address the group. ''I said: 'Nebraska? No way,' '' she recalled. '' 'I'm not helping some Republican fake liberal who just wants to use the youth vote to get out of the primaries.' '' Then she saw a picture of Scott Kleeb, and her resistance immediately softened. ''I was like: 'Approved. Definitely. Whatever it takes to get him here.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Kleeb spoke at the gathering, and over the course of the campaign season, the two kept running into each other at Democratic fund-raisers around the country. Scott began calling her to ask for campaign advice, and she traveled to Nebraska to help organize his operation. He lost in the general election, but he came closer than any Democrat in over 30 years to winning in one of the most conservative districts in the country. The day after his defeat, Scott invited her to spend Thanksgiving on his family's ranch. Four months later they married, and Jane, who'd never had any real contact with rural America, moved to Nebraska. She fell in love with the people and their homesteader-like sense of collective responsibility. ''It didn't matter if it was 2 a.m. and driving snow,'' she said, ''if your neighbor called to say they had a cow out or a fence down, you went to help.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Barack Obama's election in 2008, Kleeb campaigned throughout the state to win Senator Ben Nelson's vote for Obamacare. In the time she spent rallying Nebraska voters to pressure him, Kleeb realized that residents were much more receptive to nonconservative messages than anyone expected. In March 2010, she started the progressive group Bold Nebraska with a grant from a prominent Omaha Democrat. The organization's mission was to change Nebraska's political landscape by organizing power blocs along various progressive issues -- as long as they weren't abortion rights. ''No one was talking about all the other issues facing our state,'' Kleeb said. ''Just: 'Are you pro-life or pro-choice?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That May, a friend of Kleeb's at the National Wildlife Federation told her about a State Department hearing on the Keystone XL in York County, in the southeastern part of the state. Trans&shy;Canada's proposed line would cross the route of the huge annual migration of sandhill cranes, and federation organizers were concerned about how a spill would affect the birds. They hoped Kleeb might attend the meeting with them and join forces in opposing the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleeb wanted to steer clear of the issue. Bold Nebraska had yet to find its feet, and she was looking for a cause to unite progressives with Nebraska's growing independent population. Environmental campaigns had never resonated with her, and despite farmers' appreciation for their land, she knew that conservatives in Nebraska were not sympathetic to what they saw as a lefty cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You think environmentalist, you think hippie kid on the street who doesn't shower,'' Kleeb said. ''I felt like there was no emotional connection in the fights they were waging.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her friend pushed her, though -- hadn't her husband's ancestors homesteaded on the edge of the Sandhills? -- and in the end, Kleeb showed up at the York Community Center to find the room packed with farmers who opposed the pipeline. One by one, they took the stand to describe how they had been bullied by Trans&shy;Canada's land agents and to talk about their concerns for their land and, especially, their water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pipeline's route would pass through the Sandhills in north-central Nebraska and over the Ogallala Aquifer, the lifeblood of Great Plains agriculture. In much of the region, the water table is at or near the surface. At the time of the meeting, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster was still underway, devastating fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and leaving Nebraska farmers worried about a spill in their own backyards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleeb stood in the back, stunned. She had never thought of the potential for a large-scale environmental disaster in the middle of Nebraska. All of the press material she'd been given, all of the briefings from environmental groups -- none of it had left much of an impression. But these people did. ''All I could think about in that room was how they reminded me of Scott's family, the folks I fell in love with,'' she said. ''Farmers and ranchers don't think politically. I felt like I had to help.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleeb had spent the last 15 years looking for dramatic, visual stories to advance political agendas, working on the principle that the best way to convert people was to show them others who were affected by an issue. Here was one of the best stories she'd ever seen: Conservative American farmers rise up to protect their land. She could use the image of the family farm to reframe the way Nebraskans thought about environmentalism. It wasn't going to be Save the Sandhill Cranes. It was going to be Save the Neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unrest Kleeb witnessed in York was present all along the pipeline's proposed route, from Montana to the Texas coast. By the early 2000s, projections were being made that the bitumen boom in the Alberta oil sands region would outstrip the capacity of the existing infrastructure. Trans&shy;Canada's Keystone project was one of several pipelines designed to move bitumen and heavy crude south as efficiently as possible. Starting in 2008, land agents working with the company spread out along the route to begin acquiring easements. They sat at kitchen tables and told landowners how the line would wean the country off dependence on foreign oil, how it would bring jobs to Americans and money to the landowners. But the terms they offered seemed one-sided: Trans&shy;Canada would hold the easements for as long as the pipeline was in place, and the company reserved the right to abandon the pipe in the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Texas, some landowners sued the company in state court, arguing that the project misused eminent-domain laws. One landowner in East Texas, David Daniel, built a network of treehouses along his 20 acres, and environ&shy;mental&shy; activists from the group Tar Sands Blockade camped in them, slowing the pipeline's progress. (Daniel backed down when the company's lawyers threatened to sue him.) But it was only in Nebraska that the unrest coalesced into a cohesive, powerful movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pipelines carrying oil, unlike those for natural gas, are mostly regulated by the states. In all but Colorado, pipelines generally get the right of eminent domain -- but most states can restrict that right, determining whether pipelines are in the public interest and what routes they can take. In 13 states, including Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma (and, until recently, Nebraska), there is no such approval process. If a company wants the land but the owner doesn't want to make a deal, it can deposit its estimated fair value with a court and start building. If a landowner wants to challenge the company, he has to square off in court against a multibillion-dollar corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stoody, a spokesman with the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, told me that pipeline companies needed strong eminent-domain laws so they could build vital infrastructure and ''prevent a single person from stopping a project that will benefit the greater public good.'' This leaves landowners with no bargaining power when the companies come calling for their land. ''Pipeline companies hold all the cards,'' says Jeremy Hopkins, a Virginia attorney who has represented hundreds of landowners in eminent-domain cases. ''The company decides where they're going to put the pipeline, the rights they're going to take. No ordinary buyer has that kind of power.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever its legal rights, Trans&shy;Canada badly misread popular sentiment in Nebraska. The state is Republican but deeply independent; it was the home of William Jennings Bryan and the late-1800s populist movement. Rather than rallying behind the idea of American independence from Middle Eastern oil, Nebraskans saw a foreign company coming into their state and asserting rights to land that had been in their families for generations. ''The attitude when doing business here is, Treat me fairly, tell me the truth, I'll work with you,'' said David Domina, an Omaha lawyer who represents hundreds of farmers and ranchers in negotiations with Trans&shy;Canada. Nebraska's public utilities would take years to plan a new telephone or power project, and they would work hard to convince farmers that a project was in the public interest. But Trans&shy;Canada came in with ''corporate weaponry blazing,'' Domina said. He claimed that agents lied to his clients about whether their neighbors had signed easement agreements and about how little money they would get if they didn't. Trans&shy;Canada, through a spokesman, Shawn Howard, denied those accusations. The company stressed that it does not provide information to one landowner about another's private property and pointed out that all registered easements are publicly available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the agents contacted Randy Thompson about his family's land in Merrick County, Thompson was confused at first, and then angry. ''They came out here with this great sense of entitlement,'' Thompson told me, ''and we were just supposed to get out of the road. They said all the neighbors had signed, and if we were smart, we'd sign now -- or we'd get a lot less money. These guys just treat you like bugs they can squash.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson wrote to Gov. Dave Heineman asking if Trans&shy;Canada had eminent-domain authority, and he remembers being mailed a pamphlet about the pipeline in response. Thompson's lawyer told him that there was probably nothing he could do. ''I wasn't going to let them roll over my parents like that,'' Thompson said. Late in 2010, he read that Kleeb was organizing resistance to the pipeline. A lifelong Republican who had never done anything more political than vote, Thompson began attending Bold Nebraska meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I walked into Kleeb's house in Hastings in February, she was dressed in sweatpants and sitting in her paper-strewn office. She was in the middle of a fund-raising call with progressive donors, including the California billionaire Tom Steyer, who were interested in rural organizing and fighting climate change. But Kleeb was careful not to use the word ''environment'' or mention climate change, preferring to talk ''about the land'' and the rich foreigners putting the country's water at risk. ''Donors crave a much more authentic voice,'' she explained. ''We have a connection to rural communities that many other progressive groups just don't have.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the four years since that first meeting in York, Kleeb has logged thousands of miles traveling up and down the pipeline route, from Texas to Alberta, building relationships with ranchers and activists. But her main goal was always organizing Nebraskans, building relationships throughout the state's small towns with groups like the Nebraska Farmers Union and then learning about local leaders through them. She targeted those leaders directly, trying to persuade them to invite people to her meetings. The farther north she pushed into the Sandhills, the bigger the meetings got. After her presentations, she watched to see whom residents crowded around and focused her future efforts on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There were all these old people sitting in the back with their arms crossed, testing me,'' she said of the meetings in the Sandhills. ''It was like they wanted to make sure I was going to stick around.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Kleeb's tenets of organizing is that if you want to reach a specific group of people, you have to use someone from that group to help you make your case. ''One thing the climate organizations don't get is that the scientific numbers don't move people,'' she said. ''People here care about their neighbors. So we were looking for a face.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleeb met Thompson at a meeting in the Sandhills in 2010. She learned that he came from a long line of farmers and had worked as a cattle auctioneer. Over the next few months they became ''fast friends,'' Thompson said. He often stood silently by her like a bodyguard at meetings that grew contentious. He knew people in the area and was at ease talking publicly. (During an appearance on ''The Ed Show'' on MSNBC this year, in reference to Trans&shy;Canada's claims about the pipeline's safety, he asked dryly, ''What was the safest ship that was ever built?'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the 2011 state legislative session, Kleeb and her growing group of supporters tried to get the state to establish some process to regulate oil pipelines, but even progressive Democrats, Kleeb told me, were resistant. They argued that Nebraska needed the jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Bold Nebraska's campaign got a smattering of national attention, media coverage of the Keystone XL was primarily concerned with the doings of the large environmentalist organizations -- what Kleeb calls ''Big Green.'' Few people outside the movement realized that Nebraska had become ground zero for the fight to stop the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the legislative session ended without any regulations being passed, Kleeb approached Thompson and said she needed a face for this campaign. ''I told him that if he agreed to help, there would be negative stories and backlash.'' Thompson was willing, and Bold Nebraska soon started the ''Stand With Randy'' campaign, putting his face on T-shirts, yard signs and a website. ''There's one question we are asking every Nebraskan, including all of our elected officials, this summer,'' the home page read. ''Do you stand with Randy or do you stand with Trans&shy;Canada?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The culmination of the effort came at a Nebraska Cornhuskers football game in Lincoln that September, when a Trans&shy;Canada ad titled ''Husker Pipeline'' ran on the stadium's giant HuskerVision screen. The stadium erupted in spontaneous booing, delighting Kleeb, who later asked people to go to State Department hearings in Cornhusker red. The next week, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln announced that it was cutting sponsorship ties with the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the leaders of the larger climate-change movement, the group's work in Nebraska has turned the tide against the Keystone XL. Bill McKibben, one of the intellectual leaders of the movement, told me that the Cornhusker uprising was one of the first moments he thought they could actually win the larger pipeline fight. ''There's no question that that moment happened because of the work Jane was doing,'' he said. Kenny Bruno, who has coordinated many of the groups involved in the movement, went even further. ''Without Jane and a few other people, without their organizing and education on the route, that pipeline would have been built already.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fall of 2011, Bold Nebraska held a pumpkin-carving party; hundreds of supporters surrounded the Governor's Mansion with jack-o'-lanterns that spelled out ''91 leaks and 0 regulations is scary,'' a reference to one prediction about the number of times the Keystone could spill over its lifetime. On Nov. 10, the State Department, which would have to approve a permit for the pipeline because it crossed international borders, announced that it would conduct an ''in-depth assessment'' of alternative routes because of concerns about the Sandhills. Four days after that, Trans&shy;Canada presented a new route for the XL leg that would bypass the region. The Nebraska Legislature passed the Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act a week later, establishing for the first time in the state's history pipeline siting and regulatory requirements. Now companies could not use eminent domain to take land for a pipeline wider than six inches without first having its route approved by the state's Public Service Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By then, the Keystone XL was a national issue: Republicans and Democrats in Congress spent the later part of 2011 pushing Obama to make a decision on whether to approve a permit. But the State Department was required to do an environmental-impact study of the new route, and Trans&shy;Canada would have to acquire new easements. With the status of the Keystone XL stretching off into the indeterminate future, the State Department denied the permit. The entire northern part of the line -- from Nebraska to the border -- was now blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the fight in Nebraska, Trans&shy;Canada showed a baffling inability to learn from its public-relations mistakes. After being defeated by a campaign focused on disrespect for the Nebraskans, the company did an end run around the regulatory system the Legislature had set up only months before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2012, State Senator Jim Smith, a Trans&shy;Canada ally, sponsored a bill that let oil-pipeline companies apply directly to the governor, bypassing the new process overseen by the Public Service Commission. (After Trans&shy;Canada's planned reroute, Governor Heineman declared himself a supporter of the pipeline.) The bill passed; that May, TransCanada reapplied to the State Department for a permit. In January 2013, despite fervent lobbying from Bold Nebraska, Heineman approved the redirected pipeline. It was a step closer to State Department approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pipeline's new path, however, presented a chance for Bold Nebraska and others to stymie the company by organizing landowners before they could sign easement agreements, something the group had been too late to do with many of the owners on the first route. Throughout 2012 and 2013, Kleeb and Domina, the Omaha attorney, rallied about a quarter of the people on the new route into a power bloc to resist the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By getting Heineman to approve the Keystone XL, Trans&shy;Canada had also left itself legally vulnerable: If the courts ruled that the governor didn't have such authority, the company had no real leverage to push the pipeline forward. So Kleeb and Domina picked three landowners to sue the office of the governor, arguing that the law giving him the power to permit pipelines was unconstitutional. In February, the state district court ruled that it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the company could once again apply through the Public Service Commission for permission to go forward, it is instead waiting while Heineman's attorney general appeals to the State Supreme Court; a ruling is unlikely before late this year. On April 18, the State Department announced that it wouldn't decide on Trans&shy;Canada's permit application until the Nebraska court ruled. As of today, Nebraska is the crucial piece in determining the fate of the line: Until the State Supreme Court rules, there can't be a final route, and until there's a final route, the State Department won't decide on the permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's public-relations team has responded by arguing that Kleeb fomented the farmers' uprising on behalf of East Coast environmentalists who hate fossil fuels. ''Jane is a very effective misinformer,'' Barry Rubin, a former head of the Nebraska Democratic Party and now a consultant for Trans&shy;Canada, told me. ''She uses hyperbole and fear to make reasonable people think that something awful is about to happen. She's embellishing to susceptible people.'' We were sitting in Rubin's office, drinking Blanton's bourbon. He said that he was concerned about the environment -- he had voted for Obama twice -- but that ''there's the delusion that if the pipeline isn't permitted, it will slow development of the oil sands. It won't. The oil will get used.'' If not in a pipeline, he added, it would come out in trains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked Howard, Trans&shy;Canada's spokesman, about accusations that the company threatened landowners, he responded, ''Saying, 'Here's an offer for compensation, here's a process we're required to follow,' I'm not sure how that's a threat.'' He said the company had never claimed eminent domain in Nebraska. Rubin and Howard genuinely seemed not to understand why the farmers were upset -- they believed that the problem was Jane Kleeb. ''It's just Chicago-style politics,'' Rubin told me. ''Jane takes the Randy Thompsons of the world, winds them up and lets them go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long after that conversation, I asked Thompson if he thought there might be any truth to the suggestion that Kleeb ''wound him up.'' ''Like we're not smart enough to figure out they're screwing us?'' he said. ''I had my eyes closed for a long time,'' he went on. ''But they're open now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson's family land was spared when Trans&shy;Canada rerouted the line, but he has stayed involved with the movement. ''All these people helped me,'' he said of the other activists. ''If it weren't for them, we'd still be on the line. So I'm going to do whatever I can. It's not good for our country&shy;. I feel very strongly about that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's going to be critical for us in the states to keep pressure on Trans&shy;Canada and keep the coalition together,'' Kleeb recently told me. Victory, she said, could be as debilitating to a movement as a defeat, sapping it of urgency. Bold Nebraska&shy; needed to shift now, she said. Last year, Kleeb raised over $65,000, most of it in small donations, to build a barn covered in solar panels on a local family's farm. The barn was partly an exercise in political theater: If Trans&shy;Canada wanted to build a pipeline, Kleeb said repeatedly, it would have to destroy locally produced clean energy to do it. But the barn is also part of a larger strategy to use the success of the pipeline fight to talk about clean energy. Polls show that a majority of Nebraskans are in favor of more renewables, and Kleeb's next step is to build a coalition around that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also wants to expand Bold Nebraska's network beyond the state. Her next focus is South Dakota, where Trans&shy;Canada's four-year construction permit will need to be recertified in June. The company will face an environment far more hostile than the one it encountered when the project was first proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, Kleeb held rallies on the National Mall with a group referred to as the ''new C.I.A.'' -- the Cowboy and Indian Alliance -- made up of ranchers from along the pipeline's route and Sioux from South Dakota tribes. Kleeb stood onstage, flanked by Sioux elders waving tribal flags. She urged people to write to Obama to tell him to deny the pipeline for good. ''We can't beat Trans&shy;Canada with money,'' she said. ''We don't have millions to spend. But we have you.'' Standing in the audience, I was struck by how insular the group seemed, hardened by a shared struggle. They talked with great feeling about what the fight against Trans&shy;Canada had given them: a new community, new friends, a new purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was in Nebraska, I asked Kleeb what the point was of actions like the jack-o'-lantern carvings and the barn raising. She laughed. Part of it was for the cameras, she said, but it went deeper. ''You're asking people to be involved. They love that -- it's part of our human nature. People want to be asked to do something bigger than themselves.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists will embark on an excavation of one of Britain's most important shipwrecks tomorrow after discovering it is deteriorating at speed because of the warmer waters caused by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-mighty 17th-century vessel, named the London, has lain in the muddy silt of the Thames estuary off the Essex coast near Southend-on-Sea for 350 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Built in 1656, she was in a convoy that transported Charles II from the Netherlands to restore him to his throne after Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English Heritage, the government advisory body, has commissioned Cotswold Archaeology to carry out the excavation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Dunkley, a marine archaeologist at English Heritage, told the Guardian: &quot;It's rare for wooden shipwrecks of this age and older to survive to this extent.&quot; The hundreds of surviving wrecks are mostly iron and steel ships, built later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the wreck was deteriorating now after 350 years, he said: &quot;Through climate&nbsp;change, warmer water is moving northwards. That's allowing the migration of warm-water invasive species.&quot; He spoke of the need for action to stop warm-water ship-boring organisms eating away at timber and organic artefacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London met her end in 1665 when she suffered a mysterious gunpowder explosion. More than 300 lives were lost in a tragedy recorded by Samuel Pepys, the diarist and secretary to the Navy Board: &quot;A little a' this side the buoy of the Nower (Nore), she suddenly blew up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archaeologists are collaborating with Steven Ellis, a diver, who has been granted the government licence. He too spoke of the need for action. During initial test dives, he spotted &quot;loads of shoe soles&quot;. When he returned, they had been washed away, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellis did, find a complete shoe that looked astonishingly modern, in superb condition considering its age. He said: &quot;The Thames has got so much silt. That's why everything is in such good nick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parametric sonar data suggest buried deposits beyond the visible remains. The excavation will be complex. Though the wreck is only up to 18 metres deep, visibility is poor. There are also strong currents and the site is at the edge of a shipping lane. &quot;It makes it a little more hairy than most dives,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London's final resting place was only confirmed in 2005. She is one of only 49 ships included under the Protection of Wrecks Act in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunkley said: &quot;Part of the excitement for us, as archaeologists, is to share with those people that can't access the London with a scuba tank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wreck offers insights into the navy when England was emerging as a global power, he added. &quot;It allows us to share our understanding of how people lived, fought and died on this class of ship. The London fills a gap in our understanding of ship technology and ship construction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finds recovered from the site will be curated, published and displayed by Southend museums service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many US companies report they're already seeing significant climate-change impacts to their business operations, according to a new report by sustainability non-profit CDP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone who maintains that climate&nbsp;change is not going to affect our lives, it may be worth listening to the concerns of America's publicly traded corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These companies, which tend to be of a more conservative persuasion and not given to hyperbole, are increasingly concerned about how climate&nbsp;change is likely to damage their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study into disclosures by S&amp;P 500 companies - released today by sustainable-economy non-profit CDP - shows not only that the physical risks from climate&nbsp;change are increasing in urgency, in their assessment, but also that the impacts are already hitting the bottom line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are quickly recognising how their business models are likely to be affected by climate challenges ranging from extreme weather events to a shortage of key resources, the study finds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2011, a quarter of S&amp;P 500 companies were worried that climate risks were either already upon them or were expected to hit within the next one to five years. Just two years later, the figure has jumped to just under half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar pattern has emerged when it comes to the companies' estimate of the likelihood of these risks becoming reality. In 2013, half the companies characterized their perception as ranging from &quot;more likely than not&quot; to &quot;virtually certain&quot;, up from just over a third of respondents in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research, based on an annual survey of 767 institutional investors with $92tn in assets, comes after Walmart's UK supermarket chain Asda told Guardian Sustainable Business that 95% of its global fresh produce range is already at risk from global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many US companies say they are already seeing significant impacts to their business operations, ranging from damage to facilities, reduced product demand, lost productivity and write-offs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dealing with climate&nbsp;change is now a cost of doing business&quot; says Tom Carnac, president of CDP in North America. &quot;Making investments in climate-change-related resilience planning both in their own operations and in the supply chain has become crucial for all corporations to manage this increasing risk&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate cost of extreme weather</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many examples within the CDP report of how extreme weather has already disrupted businesses over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A drought in China means clothing giant Gap faces a spike in cotton prices, while closer to home, Union Pacific was hit with an 11% decline in freight revenue from corn shipments as a result of a lack of rainfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildfires in San Diego cost Sempra Energy more than the $1.1bn it held in liability insurance coverage, and HP saw revenues fall 7% following the 2011 floods in Thailand. Meanwhile, Superstorm Sandy cost Consolidated Edison $431m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other recent studies have also noted growing climate&nbsp;change risks. Research released earlier this year from Schneider Electric - which concludes that climate&nbsp;change is directly related to an increase in extreme weather events - projects it will raise business risks such as higher food and commodities costs, increased financial risks, supply chain disruptions, potential transportation disruptions and new threats to crops from new insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a 2013 article in the Journal of Flood Risk Management estimated that flooding - which costs the US more than $7bn in damages annually, according to the US Geological Survey - estimated those damages would grow approximately 30% by the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually every part of the business is at risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the CDP report, drinks giant Dr Pepper Snapple Group highlights how unusual weather or long-term climate&nbsp;changes may affect virtually every part of its business, ranging from higher prices and a lack of availability affecting its raw materials, energy and fuel, to lower demand for its products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its concerns particularly focus on water, which is the main ingredient in virtually all its products. &quot;Climate&nbsp;change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. A portion of our cost of sales, or $2.5bn, could be at risk through increased costs to our supply chain as a result of these risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While US companies talk of dangers ahead, what is worrying is how few of them are taking significant action to reduce their emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A business 'imperative'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was highlighted recently by a report from Ceres, a non-profit focused on sustainable business, based on an analysis of 613 publicly listed US companies representing three-quarters of the country's total stock-market capitalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It showed that two-thirds of the companies have failed to establish time-bound reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and 94% have not set quantitative targets to increase renewable energy sourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US companies are simply not taking the comprehensive actions necessary - through energy efficiency, renewable energy procurement and other steps - to tackle climate&nbsp;change,&quot; according to the Ceres report. &quot;It is imperative that many more companies shift from being reactive to proactive in embracing the sustainability challenges that lie ahead. The need for investors, businesses, NGOs and other stakeholders to fully engage in the essential work of creating a sustainable economy has never been more urgent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists fear climate change could destroy preserved remains of the London, which blew up off Essex coast in 1665</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists will embark on an emergency excavation of one of Britain's most important shipwrecks on Sunday after discovering it is deteriorating at alarming speed because of the warmer waters caused by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-mighty 17th-century vessel, named the London, has lain in the muddy silt of the Thames estuary off the Essex coast near Southend-on-Sea for 350 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Built in 1656, she was in a convoy that transported Charles II from the Netherlands to restore him to his throne after Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658. One of the most illustrious ships of her day, her remains are now a time capsule of the 17th century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English Heritage, the government advisory body, has commissioned Cotswold Archaeology to carry out a major excavation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Dunkley, a marine archaeologist at English Heritage, told the Guardian: &quot;It's rare for wooden shipwrecks of this age and older to survive to this extent.&quot; The hundreds of surviving wrecks are mostly later iron and steel ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the wreck is deteriorating now after 350 years, he said: &quot;Through human-induced climate&nbsp;change, warmer water is moving northwards. That's allowing the migration of warm-water invasive species.&quot; He spoke of the need for action to stop warm-water ship-boring organisms eating away at timber and organic artefacts and prevent loose objects being dispersed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London met her end in 1665 when she suffered a mysterious gunpowder explosion. More than 300 lives were lost in a tragedy recorded by Samuel Pepys, the diarist and secretary to the Navy Board: &quot;A little a' this side the buoy of the Nower [Nore], she suddenly blew up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 24 [men] and a woman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diarist John Evelyn also lamented &quot;the poor orphans and widows&quot; left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archaeologists are collaborating with Steven Ellis, a Thames estuary diver, who has been granted the government licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He too spoke of the need for action. During initial test dives, he spotted &quot;loads of shoe soles&quot;. When he returned, they had been washed away, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellis did, however, find a complete shoe that looked astonishingly modern, in superb condition considering its age. He said: &quot;The Thames has got so much silt. That's why everything is in such good nick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His other initial finds included personal items such as a bronze signet ring and clay pipes, as well as navigational dividers, buckets, pots and cooking utensils. He retrieved ship's fixtures and fittings such as door latches, an anchor cable and cannonballs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parametric sonar data suggest buried deposits beyond the visible remains. Other tests have uncovered extremely unusual female human remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excavation will be complex. Though the wreck is only up to 18 metres deep, visibility is poor. Ellis said: &quot;On a good day, you've got perhaps half a metre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also strong currents and the site is at the edge of a shipping lane. &quot;It makes it a little more hairy than most dives,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London's final resting place was only confirmed in 2005. She is one of only 49 ships protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act in England, an indication of her importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunkley said: &quot;Part of the excitement for us, as archaeologists, is to share with those people that can't access the London with a scuba tank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wreck offers insights into the navy when England was emerging as a global power, he added. &quot;It allows us to share our understanding of how people lived, fought and died on this class of ship. The London fills a gap in our understanding of ship technology and ship construction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vessel was fitted for war when she blew up. The women on board were possibly officers' relatives. Perhaps they would have disembarked as the ship would have been fully prepared for war, Dunkley suggests. &quot;Pepys talks of ladies being on board. We don't know whether they were guests masquerading as crew members, which happened in Admiral Nelson's time. Or whether they were guests of the lower decks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she blew up, the ship seems to be pretty complete, lying in two sections. She was once 37 metres long by 12 metres wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divers will excavate the bow, the hold, the main gun deck and the carpenter's and boatswain's storerooms. Finds recovered from the site will be curated, published and displayed by Southend Museums Service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decision not to publish paper in Environmental Research Letters had nothing to do with 'activism' of peer reviewers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change scientists have reacted angrily to charges that an academic paper was rejected by a peer-reviewed journal because of intolerance of dissenting views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A paper by a group of researchers headed by Lennart Bengtsson, a University of Reading research fellow, was turned down for publication by Environmental Research Letters. Bengtsson was briefly a board member of the climate sceptic organisation the Global Warming Policy Foundation, founded by former UK chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, but he resigned last week citing pressure from other academics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He turned to the Times newspaper to complain that the journal's rejection of his paper was on &quot;activist&quot; grounds. But the publishers of the journal, the Institute of Physics, said on Friday that the paper was rejected because it contained scientific flaws, and not for any political reasons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large number of the scientific papers submitted to peer-reviewed journals are rejected, usually because of criticisms of the scientific methods used or because the research does not represent a major new advance in thinking. Environmental Research Letters told the Guardian that it rejects about 65-70% of the papers submitted to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper in question dealt with the sensitivity of the climate to rises in greenhouse gases, claiming to have found inconsistencies in recent analyses of how much temperature is likely to rise if concentrations in the atmosphere should increase. But the reviewers found that the claim of inconsistencies was invalid, particularly as a variety of results are likely to be found by any such analysis, because all climate science deals in a range of possible future outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Gulley, editorial director at IOP Publishing, said: &quot;The draft journal paper by Lennart Bengtsson that Environmental Research Letters declined to publish, which was the subject of this morning's front page story of The Times, contained errors, in our view did not provide a significant advancement in the field, and therefore could not be published in the journal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;The decision not to publish had absolutely nothing to do with any 'activism' on the part of the reviewers or the journal, as suggested in The Times' article; the rejection was solely based on the content of the paper not meeting the journal's high editorial standards. The referees selected to review this paper were of the highest calibre and are respected members of the international science community. The comments taken from the referee reports were taken out of context and therefore, in the interests of transparency, we have worked with the reviewers to make the full reports available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their reports, the reviewers stated that &quot;the overall innovation of the manuscript is very low&quot;, and this meant it did not meet requirements for the papers in the journal to &quot;significantly advance knowledge in the field&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They wrote: &quot;The comparison between observation based estimates of [warming] ... and model-based estimates is comparing apples and pears, as the models are calculating true global means, whereas the observations have limited coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other academics defended the peer-review process. Simon Lewis, reader in global change science at University College London, said: &quot;What counts are the reasons the editor gave for rejection. They were because the paper contained important errors and didn't add enough that was new to warrant publication. Looking at all the comments by the reviewer they suggested how the paper might be rewritten in the future to make it a solid contribution to science. That's not suppressing a dissenting view, it's what scientists call peer review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute on climate&nbsp;change, said: &quot;This episode should not distract us from the fact that we are performing a very dangerous experiment with the Earth's climate. Even by the end of this century, on current trends we risk changes of a magnitude that are unprecedented in the last 10,000 years. How we respond to that is a matter of public policy, but scientists clearly play a key role in providing policymakers with the evidence they require.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper by Bengtsson and others was submitted to Environmental Research Letters in mid-February and rejected in early March after reports by two international referees found &quot;significant scientific errors&quot;. Following that, the authors asked for the paper to be considered as an opinion piece rather than a research paper. The journal rejected this suggestion after a further review by two other experts in the field. The final decision was made in early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengtsson was appointed to the Global Warming Policy Foundation academic advisory council on 30 April this year, and resigned barely two weeks later on 14 May. His resignation was covered by the Times the next day, with Bengtsson claiming to have been subjected to &quot;McCarthy&quot;-like persecution by his academic peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No specific examples of the persecution that took place during those two weeks were cited, and when contacted by the Guardian Bengtsson did not provide any such examples. The foundation did not respond when asked whether it had initiated the contact with the Times, or whether the newspaper's reporter had contacted it first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times story on Thursday, though it received relatively little prominence in the newspaper, was the most-read article on its website on that day. On Friday, the Times followed up with a front-page story on how Bengtsson's February article had been rejected by Environmental Research Letters about a month previously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Absurd anti-science faux journalism flares up again - as usual, it's Big Oil that's set to benefit, not the public</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning I, like any of you, was disappointed to see that the frontpage of The Times carried a story by the paper's environment editor, Ben Wester, which read, 'Scientists in cover-up of &quot;damaging&quot; climate view.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Variations of the story had been plastered everywhere, spearheaded by Murdoch-owned outlets, repeated uncritically by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Mail, much loved for its objective reporting on climate&nbsp;change (and other stuff), declared: 'Climate&nbsp;change scientist claims he has been forced from new job in &quot;McCarthy&quot;-style witch-hunt by academics across the world.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These stories were quoted approvingly by the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto as &quot;the latest reason to distrust the authority of 'consensus' climate scientists.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even a cursory glance reveals how thin these stories are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest climate denialist outburst hinges on one man - Prof Lennart Bengtsson of the University of Reading. According to the Mail and The Times, a paper submitted by Bengtsson to Environmental Research Letters, was rejected by the journal not because it was bad science, but because of political &quot;intolerance of dissenting views on climate science&quot; among climate scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper purported to challenge the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change's (IPCC) projections that global average temperatures could rise by more than 4 degrees Celsius by end of century, claiming that the climate was much less sensitive to carbon dioxide emissions than widely understood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengtsson also complained that he had been bullied by climate scientists &quot;all over the world&quot; after he joined the notorious 'sceptic' think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), causing him to resign. The letter was published two days ago on the GWPF website as a press release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been put under such an enormous group pressure in recent days from all over the world that has become virtually unbearable to me. If this is going to continue I will be unable to conduct my normal work and will even start to worry about my health and safety. I see therefore no other way out therefore than resigning from GWPF. I had not expecting such an enormous world-wide pressure put at me from a community that I have been close to all my active life. Colleagues are withdrawing their support, other colleagues are withdrawing from joint authorship etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see no limit and end to what will happen. It is a situation that reminds me about the time of McCarthy. I would never have expecting anything similar in such an original peaceful community as meteorology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contradicting this, however, in an apparent effort to pretend that the scientific community actually agrees with Bengtsson's claims about climate&nbsp;change, The Times story also reports: &quot;Scientists from around the world sent messages of support to Professor Bengtsson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So which is it? Did scientists worldwide support him or bully him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, there there seems little actual evidence for non-scientific motivations behind the rejection of Bengtsson's work. The Mail and Times, for instance, spin the quote of an unnamed scientist who had been asked to peer-review his paper submitted to Environmental Research Letters, saying the study's publication would be &quot;harmful&quot; to the climate science orthodoxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both newspapers report this incredulously. How dare climate scientists worry about climate deniers exploiting junk science?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the journal's publisher, IOP Publishing, told the Mail that Bengtsson's submission:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... was peer-reviewed by two independent reviewers, who reported that the paper contained errors and did not provide a significant advancement in the field, and therefore failed to meet the journal's required acceptance criteria. As a consequence, the independent reviewers recommended that the paper should not be published in the journal which led to the final editorial decision to reject the paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, that didn't stop these newspapers from suggesting that the decision was motivated by concerns other than advancing and protecting science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Prof Bengtsson to substantiate his allegations by clarifying the number of scientists who had allegedly been pressurising him to the point that he feared for his safety. I also requested to see the full text of the reports of the scientists who had peer-reviewed his rejected study due its scientific &quot;errors.&quot; He did not respond to my request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, IOP Publishing has decided to make the full reviewer reports publicly available so that we can all see why Bengtsson's paper was really rejected:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The overall innovation of the manuscript is very low, as the calculations made to compare the three studies are already available within each of the sources, most directly in Otto et al...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarising, the simplistic comparison of ranges from AR4, AR5, and Otto et al, combined with the statement they are inconsistent is less then helpful, actually it is harmful as it opens the door for oversimplified claims of &quot;errors&quot; and worse from the climate sceptics media side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from denying the validity of Bengtsson's questions, the reviewers set out ways he could improve the work:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A careful, constructive, and comprehensive analysis of what these ranges mean, and how they come to be different, and what underlying problems these comparisons bring would indeed be a valuable contribution to the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have rated the potential impact in the field as high, but I have to emphasise that this would be a strongly negative impact, as it does not clarify anything but puts up the (false) claim of some big inconsistency, where no consistency was to be expected in the first place. And I can't see an honest attempt of constructive explanation in the manuscript.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus I would strongly advise rejecting the manuscript in its current form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;unbearable&quot; scientific isolation that Prof Bengtsson experienced as a consequence of joining the GWPF, and submitting scientifically questionable material to a leading journal, should not come as a surprise. That the climate science community roundly rejects the GWPF's denialist rantings, and found Bengtsson's work in this regard unfit to publish, is evidence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">for</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the overwhelming consensus on climate&nbsp;change - not against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an illustrative example of just how isolated Prof Bengtsson and his ilk are, consider the fact reported earlier this year by Scientific American that out of more than 2,000 per-reviewed climate science publications put out over the last year from November 2012 to December 2013, the number of scientists who denied the role of human-caused CO2 emissions in current climate&nbsp;change &quot;is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">exactly one</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">That's right. One. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare that to the number of scientific authors of those 2,000 plus papers - 9,136. So over nine thousand scientists over the last year agree that our fossil fuel emissions are principally responsible for contemporary climate&nbsp;change, and just one disagrees. The poor sod must be feeling pretty damn lonely, I imagine. Perhaps almost as lonely as Prof Bengtsson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such media misrepresentation is now par for the course. According to Forbes' denialist in residence, James Taylor, &quot;only half of American Meteorology Society meteorologists believe global warming is occurring and humans are the primary cause&quot; based on a new survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actual authors of that survey, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorology Society, disagreed. In a statement responding to Taylor: &quot;Among all the respondents, about 7 out of 10 (73%) said human activities have contributed to global warming.&quot; The survey further attempted to explore differences between meteorologists specialising in climate science, and those who didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth quoting the clarification here in detail:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found that more than 9 out of 10 climate science experts (93%) who publish mostly on climate&nbsp;change, and the same proportion (93%) of climate experts who publish mostly on other topics, were convinced that humans have contributed to global warming. We also found that about 8 out of 10 meteorologists and atmospheric scientists who publish on climate (79%) or other topics (78%) were convinced that humans have contributed to global warming. Lastly, we found that the group least likely to be convinced that humans have contributed to global warming was AMS members who do not publish research in the peer-reviewed scientific literature; only six out of 10 AMS members in this group (62%) were convinced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare that to Taylor's flagrant misinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would outfits like the GWPF and Murdoch-owned press engage in such absurd faux journalism? Who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GWPF barely needs much comment. One previous Guardian investigation uncovered that one of GWPF's funders is Tory Party donor Michael Hintze, head of $5bn hedge-fund CQS which operates in theoil finance industry, among other areas. Another investigation exposed the &quot;links between Lord Lawson and the GWPF and fossil fuel companies&quot;, including &quot;a large Australian coal company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Rupert Murdoch, it's no secret that he has significant interests in the fossil fuel industry. Murdoch is a major equity share-holder in Genie Energy, where he is also a strategic advisory board member. Genie is a major investor in US and Israeli shale oil and gas projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdoch is &quot;extremely well regarded by and connected to leaders&quot; in the &quot;oil and gas industry&quot; and &quot;the financial markets,&quot; rejoiced Genie CEO at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the US journalism watchdog Media Matters, Murdoch's FOX News has frequently run news stories promoting Genie Energy's shale projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we're seeing here, then, isn't really journalism at all. Whatever its intent, in effect, it amounts to little more than glorified industry PR calling itself 'news.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real story is how the IPCC's projections and solutions are likely to be far too conservative, having been 'diluted' by pressure from the world's biggest fossil fuel polluters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By PAUL KRUGMAN</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">800 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently two research teams, working independently and using different methods, reached an alarming conclusion: The West Antarctic ice sheet is doomed. The sheet's slide into the ocean, and the resulting sharp rise in sea levels, will probably happen slowly. But it's irreversible. Even if we took drastic action to limit global warming right now, this particular process of environmental change has reached a point of no return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida -- much of whose state is now fated to sink beneath the waves -- weighed in on climate&nbsp;change. Some readers may recall that in 2012 Mr. Rubio, asked how old he believed the earth to be, replied ''I'm not a scientist, man.'' This time, however, he confidently declared the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate&nbsp;change false, although in a later interview he was unable to cite any sources for his skepticism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why would the senator make such a statement? The answer is that like that ice sheet, his party's intellectual evolution (or maybe more accurately, its devolution) has reached a point of no return, in which allegiance to false doctrines has become a crucial badge of identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been thinking a lot lately about the power of doctrines -- how support for a false dogma can become politically mandatory, and how overwhelming contrary evidence only makes such dogmas stronger and more extreme. For the most part, I've been focusing on economic issues, but the same story applies with even greater force to climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To see how it works, consider a topic I know well: the recent history of inflation scares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than five years have passed since many conservatives started warning that the Federal Reserve, by taking action to contain the financial crisis and boost the economy, was setting the stage for runaway inflation. And, to be fair, that wasn't a crazy position to take in 2009; I could have told you it was wrong (and, in fact, I did), but you could see where it was coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over time, however, as the promised inflation kept failing to arrive, there should have come a point when the inflationistas conceded their error and moved on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, however, few did. Instead, they mostly doubled down on their predictions of doom, and some moved on to conspiracy theorizing, claiming that high inflation was already happening, but was being concealed by government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why the bad behavior? Nobody likes admitting to mistakes, and all of us -- even those of us who try not to -- sometimes engage in motivated reasoning, selectively citing facts to support our preconceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hard as it is to admit one's own errors, it's much harder to admit that your entire political movement got it badly wrong. Inflation phobia has always been closely bound up with right-wing politics; to admit that this phobia was misguided would have meant conceding that one whole side of the political divide was fundamentally off base about how the economy works. So most of the inflationistas have responded to the failure of their prediction by becoming more, not less, extreme in their dogma, which will make it even harder for them ever to admit that they, and the political movement they serve, have been wrong all along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same kind of thing is clearly happening on the issue of global warming. There are, obviously, some fundamental factors underlying G.O.P. climate skepticism: The influence of powerful vested interests (including, though by no means limited to, the Koch brothers), plus the party's hostility to any argument for government intervention. But there is clearly also some kind of cumulative process at work. As the evidence for a changing climate keeps accumulating, the Republican Party's commitment to denial just gets stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of it this way: Once upon a time it was possible to take climate&nbsp;change seriously while remaining a Republican in good standing. Today, listening to climate scientists gets you excommunicated -- hence Mr. Rubio's statement, which was effectively a partisan pledge of allegiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And truly crazy positions are becoming the norm. A decade ago, only the G.O.P.'s extremist fringe asserted that global warming was a hoax concocted by a vast global conspiracy of scientists (although even then that fringe included some powerful politicians). Today, such conspiracy theorizing is mainstream within the party, and rapidly becoming mandatory; witch hunts against scientists reporting evidence of warming have become standard operating procedure, and skepticism about climate science is turning into hostility toward science in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to see what could reverse this growing hostility to inconvenient science. As I said, the process of intellectual devolution seems to have reached a point of no return. And that scares me more than the news about that ice sheet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Saudi-led coalition sought to make policy summaries as vague as possible to minimise climate action</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing evidence is emerging that the policy summaries on climate impacts and mitigation by the UN Intergovernment Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC) were significantly 'diluted' under political pressure from some of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, including Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several experts familiar with the IPCC government approval process for the 'Summary for Policymakers' (SPM) reports - documents summarising the thousands of pages of technical and scientific reports for government officials - have spoken out about their distortion due to political interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to David Wasdell, who leads on feedback dynamics in coupled complex global systems for the European Commission's Global System Dynamics and Policy (GSDP) network, &quot;Every word and line of the text previously submitted by the scientific community was examined and amended until it could be endorsed unanimously by the political representatives.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a detailed paper critiquing the WG1 Summary for Policymakers, Wasdell revealed that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Greatest pressure to establish grounds for the highest possible budget came from those countries whose national economy, political power and social stability depend on sustaining the asset value and production revenue derived from exploitation of their resources of fossil energy. Additional pressure was applied to the political agents by those vested interests whose sustained profitability was based on the extraction, refining, marketing and use of fossil energy as the ground of the global economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an accredited reviewer for the IPCC's 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, Wasdell had previously criticised the political approval process for playing down amplifying feedbacks which could accelerate climate&nbsp;change. That charge was strongly denied by the IPCC's lead authors at the time, although political interference amounting to &quot;scientific vandalism&quot; was alleged by other sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasdell told me that scientists familiar with the political approval process in Stockholm for the new WG1 Summary for Policymakers - including WG1 co-chair Prof Thomas Stocker who had signed the 2007 rejoinder to Wasdell - had confirmed that governments fought to amend text that would damage their perceived interests. His paper says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... the objections were led by Saudi Arabia, strongly supported by China, and associated with an emerging group of 'like-minded nations.' The impasse was broken following suggested modifications of both text and diagram provided by the representatives of the USA. The resulting compromise safeguards the vested interests of global dependency on fossil sources of energy, while constraining the capacity of the international community to take any effective action to deal with the threat of dangerous climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WG1 co-chair Prof Thomas Stocker, however, denied any knowledge of such political pressure, describing these allegations as &quot;not correct for WG1.&quot; He conceded that &quot;the situation is different&quot; for WG2 and WG3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasdell said that the draft submitted by scientists contained a metric projecting cumulative total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, on the basis of which a 'carbon budget' was estimated - the quantity of carbon that could be safely emitted without breaching the 2 degrees Celsius limit to avoid dangerous global warming. He said that the final version approved by governments significantly amended the original metric to increase the amount of carbon that could still be emitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total carbon budget according to this estimate is about 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) - although over 531 GtC was emitted already by 2011, leaving 469 GtC left. Applying the &quot;corrected non-linear function&quot; reduces this available budget to just &quot;280 GtC&quot; - this figure does not account for the role of greenhouse gases other than CO2, including the potential impact of thawing permafrost or methane hydrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If included, they would reduce the budget even further. Current emissions reduction pledges, therefore, still guarantee disaster. His paper reads:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... present levels of international contribution towards the reduction of emissions still led to a cumulative total of 2000 GtC by the year 2100. That left an emissions reduction gap of some 1097 GtC between promised reductions and the 903 GtC required to prevent temperature increase exceeding the policy goal of 2&deg;C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasdell thus told me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The summary for policymakers is a document of appeasement, not fit for purpose. In reality, if my calculations are correct, we not only don't have much of a carbon budget left, we have already overshot that budget - we're in overdraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasdell's claims about the politicisation of the IPCC's summary reports for policymakers are corroborated by other scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to senior IPCC chairs dated 17th April, Prof Robert Stavins - a lead author for the IPCC's Working Group 3 focusing on climate mitigation - complained of his &quot;frustration&quot; that the government approval process &quot;built political credibility by sacrificing scientific integrity.&quot; His critique was, however, widely misrepresented by climate deniers as proving that the IPCC's scientific verdict about the dangers of global warming are too alarmist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the pack, Daily Mail reporter David Rose attempted to equate Stavins' concerns with those of economist Richard Tol, who withdrew &quot;from the summary of an earlier volume of the full IPCC report, on the grounds it had been 'sexed up' by the same government officials and had become overly 'alarmist.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as noted by Dimitri Zenghelis, principal research fellow at the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute on Climate&nbsp;Change and the Environment, Tol's claims about IPCC alarmism are riddled with &quot;significant errors and misrepresentations,&quot; &quot;selective&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot; quoting, and based on his own paper containing &quot;a number of mistakes&quot;, as well as a &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; understanding of &quot;the risks of climate&nbsp;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IPCC's assessments of the potential costs of climate&nbsp;change &quot;is probably an underestimate,&quot; argued Zenghelis, &quot;because it omits consideration of many of the impacts of climate&nbsp;change, including potentially catastrophic risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Stavins himself dismissed the denialist &quot;fringe elements of the press and blogosphere&quot; which &quot;capitalised on the situation by distorting the message of my original post to meet their own objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My expressed concerns,&quot; Stavins told me, &quot;were about the government approval process of one section on international cooperation of the Working Group 3 Summary for Policymakers.&quot; He emphasised: &quot;My remarks did not include any comments on and have no implications regarding the integrity of climate science.&quot; Rather, government representatives in Berlin sought to &quot;protect their respective countries' interests by minimising text that could be perceived to be inconsistent with their negotiating positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stavins' remarks were also backed up by Oxford University's Prof John Broome, a IPCC WG3 lead author:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At our IPCC meeting, they treated the SPM as though it were a legal document rather than a scientific report. To achieve consensus, the text of the SPM was made vaguer in many places, and its content diluted to the extent that in some places not much substance remained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from being too alarmist, these criticisms suggest that the IPCC's summary reports are too conservative. Like Wasdell, Broome describes how &quot;a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia&quot; at the April approval session in Berlin &quot;insisted&quot; that all &quot;figures&quot; depicting increases of greenhouse gas emissions in countries classified by 'income group' &quot;should be deleted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia, he said, also &quot;wanted to delete all references to any part of the main report that mentioned income groups... in the end Saudi Arabia got its way completely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Sydney Morning Herald, other countries leading the drive to dilute the document included China, Brazil and the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Scientists Warn of Rising Oceans From Polar Melt'' (front page, May 13):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounding the tragedy of the collapsing West Antarctic ice sheet is the fact that the possibility was foreseen more than three decades ago. It was, for example, one of the warnings in the 1981 climate&nbsp;change assessment issued by the Council on Environmental Quality during the Carter administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Jan. 14, 1981, article about our report noted that we urged ''that agreement be reached by industrialized nations on a safe maximum level for carbon dioxide in the air. It suggested a level 50 percent higher than that of preindustrial times as an upper limit.'' In other words, we knew enough way back then, when there was plenty of time for effective action, to suggest that carbon dioxide be capped at not more than 420 parts per million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we are already at 400 p.p.m. and climbing steadily. Only the most heroic national and international actions can limit the buildup at 450 p.p.m., and many climate analysts, probably most, now see little chance of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world will not act vigorously on the climate issue without United States leadership, and that has been a scarce commodity indeed. The United States' response to the climate crisis has been beyond pathetic. It is probably the greatest dereliction of civic responsibility in the history of the Republic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists keep reiterating that not only is climate&nbsp;change for real, but also that its consequences appear worse than the previous mainstream predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans have grown accustomed to not expecting much from our politicians. Still, when it comes to responding to the challenge of climate&nbsp;change, the contemporary Republican Party has set a new standard for dysfunction in government. Rather than heeding these increasingly emphatic warnings by legitimate experts, Republican leaders purport to be persuaded by the denials of willfully ignorant right-wing tribunes and fossil fuel industry flacks. Republican complicity with this campaign of disinformation has been fostering disastrous public complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this absolutely critical issue, we are witnessing not so much a ''do nothing'' Republican Party as one that is actively endangering the national interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate&nbsp;change is caused to a significant degree by human activity (''Rubio Denies Humans Have an Effect on Climate&nbsp;Change,'' news article, May 12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we are entitled to know on what basis he rejects this scientific consensus. If he has alternative ways of reaching conclusions on scientific matters, he should be open about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What other settled scientific matters does Mr. Rubio dispute? The germ theory of disease? The link between smoking and lung cancer? Evolution? Oh, wait. In 2012, Mr. Rubio told GQ magazine, ''I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The persistent denial of the scientific method and the rejection of conclusions based on sound science have enormous and terrible consequences for the well-being of our planet and of ourselves. Magical thinking is not a political philosophy. Or at least it shouldn't be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A Vatican meeting of scientists, economists and theologians produces a joint statement charting a technical and moral path to a sustainable and just human future. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group statement has emerged from &quot;Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Planet, Our Responsibility,&quot; the Vatican meeting of scientists, economists, theologians and others that I participated in earlier this month. (If you missed it, click here to watch or read the summary I presented as the meeting ended.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was remarkable both because it was only the second joint meeting of the Pontifical Academies of Sciences and Social Sciences and because of the range of participants: from Archbishop Roland Minnerath (of Dijon, France) to the 96-year-old Scripps Institution oceanographer Walter Munk to Paulus Zulu, a South African sociologist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement divides humanity's task, appropriately, into the technical and scientific enterprise of nurturing human societies with sustainable sources of clean energy and food - which the participants deemed &quot;available or within reach,&quot; and the much greater challenge of building the moral commitment and governmental and financial structures that can reduce inequity, profiteering and other social ills. It held echoes of Pope Francis's writings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human action which is not respectful of nature becomes a boomerang for human beings that creates inequality and extends what Pope Francis has termed &quot;the globalization of indifference&quot; and the &quot;economy of exclusion&quot; (Evangelii Gaudium), which themselves endanger solidarity with present and future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A line about &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; will surely raise hackles in some circles. And there was no mention of the words population or fertility, even though there were long discussions of demographics at the meeting demonstrating that both population and consumption growth matter. Nontheless, for many participants, myself included, it was a valuable step simply for the Vatican to host this meeting and a discussion including the full array of factors shaping humanity's journey. Pope Francis's brief meeting with the participants, along with the involvement of several of his senior advisers, hinted that some of the conclusions have a decent chance of emerging in his anticipated writings on the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in any statement reflecting the shared views of a range of individuals and institutions, this one lacks specifics, although a host of policy choices were explored in the four days of presentations and discussion. Once the permanent archive of papers and presentations is available, I'll add a link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's an excerpt with a link to the full statement: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technological and operational bases for a true sustainable development are available or within reach. Extreme poverty can be ended through targeted investments in sustainable energy access, education, health, housing, social infrastructure and livelihoods for the poor. Social inequalities can be reduced through the defense of human rights, the rule of law, participatory democracy, universal access to public services, the recognition of personal dignity, a significant improvement in the effectiveness of fiscal and social policies, an ethical finance reform, large scale decent work creation policies, integration of the informal and popular economic sectors, and national and international collaboration to eradicate the new forms of slavery such as forced labor and sexual exploitation. Energy systems can be made much more efficient and much less dependent on coal, petrol and natural gas to avoid climate change, protect the oceans, and clean the air of coal-based pollutants. Food production can be made far more fruitful and less wasteful of land and water, more respectful of peasants and indigenous people and less polluting. Food wastage can be cut significantly, with both social and ecological benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the greatest challenge lies in the sphere of human values. The main obstacles to achieving sustainability and human inclusion are inequality, unfairness, corruption and human trafficking. Our economies, our democracies, our societies and our cultures pay a high price for the growing gap between the rich and the poor within and between nations. And perhaps the most deleterious aspect of the widening income and wealth gap in so many countries is that it is deepening inequality of opportunity. Most importantly, inequality, global injustice, and corruption are undermining our ethical values, personal dignity and human rights. We need, above all, to change our convictions and attitudes, and combat the globalization of indifference with its culture of waste and idolatry of money. We should insist upon the preferential option for the poor; strengthen the family and community; and honor and protect Creation as humanity's imperative responsibility to future generations. We have the innovative and technological capability to be good stewards of Creation. Humanity needs urgently to redirect our relationship with nature by adopting the Sustainable Development Goals so as to promote a sustainable pattern of economic development and social inclusion. A human ecology that is healthy in terms of ethical virtues contributes to the achievement of sustainable nature and a balanced environment. Today we need a relationship of mutual benefit: true values should permeate the economy and respect for Creation should promote human dignity and wellbeing.<BR>These are matters on which all religions and individuals of goodwill can agree. These are matters that today's young people around the world will embrace, as a way to shape a better world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Why Divestment Fails,'' by Ivo Welch (Op-Ed, May 10):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford did not divest from coal to make a statement or with the expectation of solving climate&nbsp;change in a single stroke. It was a decision about how the university chooses to invest its own resources, pure and simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An extensive review evaluated fossil fuel investments against the university's long-held policy on investment responsibility. The review concluded that because coal is among the most carbon-intensive energy sources and because less environmentally damaging alternatives are available, coal mining is a sector in which Stanford no longer wishes to invest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other institutions will, and should, evaluate these issues for themselves. Meanwhile, other efforts clearly are necessary to advance environmental sustainability, and Stanford is deeply engaged in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are building a new energy system that will cut campus carbon emissions in half. Our proxy voting guidelines urge companies in which we invest to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And our faculty and students continue to pursue one of the largest research programs in the country developing renewable energy solutions that can be put to work in the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is chairwoman of Stanford University's Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As student leaders in the fossil fuel divestment movement, we want to clarify our goals and theory of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divestment campaign does not aim to affect the share prices of fossil fuel companies. Divestment aims to stigmatize the fossil fuel industry; to spark dialogue about its role in polluting politics, harming communities and driving the climate crisis; and to build a powerful, organized climate movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To dismiss divestment's noneconomic utility is to ignore history. When Nelson Mandela was released from prison, he visited California to thank personally the students who pushed the University of California to divest from South Africa. Now, the apartheid-era hero Desmond Tutu has called for fossil fuel divestment, writing that we can stop climate&nbsp;change if we use the tactics that worked in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree that our institutions of higher learning must focus on renewable energy research, but this should by no means preclude fossil fuel divestment. Stanford, Harvard and the University of California -- already world leaders in renewable energy research -- should align their investments with a clean and just energy future, a future the fossil fuel industry's business model and practices run fundamentally counter to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divestment movement is already amplifying the dialogue around climate solutions, engaging thousands of students worldwide, and bolstering a fast-growing climate&nbsp;change movement. To us, that is why divestment succeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPHIR BRUCK CHLOE MAXMIN KRISHNA DASARATHA Berkeley, Calif., May 11, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bruck is a senior at the University of California, Berkeley; Ms. Maxmin is a junior at Harvard; and Mr. Dasaratha is a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivo Welch is right. Stanford's coal divestment will not cause coal companies to change their behavior. But that misses the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fossil fuel divestment has two goals, both achievable. First, it aligns actions with values. Colleges intent on weaning themselves and the world from a carbon-based lifestyle should not seek endowment profits from fossil fuels. Call it irreconcilable differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, divestment changes the public discourse on our collective energy future. It's aimed not at oil companies, but at those who must craft a public policy consistent with a habitable planet. Divestment reminds us -- implores us -- to place society's interests above those of one industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On issues of great moral consequence -- and climate&nbsp;change is surely one -- the academy has a duty to educate not only its students, but also society at large. It also has a duty to lead, not follow. The question is not why a few institutions such as Stanford and Pitzer College, of which I am a trustee, have begun to divest. Rather, it is why so many others have not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The accelerating rate of climate&nbsp;change poses a severe risk to national security and acts as a catalyst for global political conflict, a report published Tuesday by a leading government-funded military research organization concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNA Corporation Military Advisory Board found that climate&nbsp;change-induced drought in the Middle East and Africa is leading to conflicts over food and water and escalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent clashes. The report also found that rising sea levels are putting people and food supplies in vulnerable coastal regions like eastern India, Bangladesh and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam at risk and could lead to a new wave of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the report predicted that an increase in catastrophic weather events around the world will create more demand for American troops, even as flooding and extreme weather events at home could damage naval ports and military bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Secretary of State John Kerry signaled that the report's findings would influence American foreign policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Tribes are killing each other over water today,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Think of what happens if you have massive dislocation, or the drying up of the waters of the Nile, of the major rivers in China and India. The intelligence community takes it seriously, and it's translated into action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry, who plans to deliver a major speech this summer on the links between climate&nbsp;change and national security, said his remarks would also be aimed at building political support for President Obama's climate&nbsp;change agenda, including a new regulation to cut pollution from coal-fired power plants that the administration will introduce in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're going to try to lay out to people legitimate options for action that are not bank-breaking or negative,'' Mr. Kerry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon officials said the report would affect military policy. ''The department certainly agrees that climate&nbsp;change is having an impact on national security, whether by increasing global instability, by opening the Arctic or by increasing sea level and storm surge near our coastal installations,'' John Conger, the Pentagon's deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment, said in a statement. ''We are actively integrating climate considerations across the full spectrum of our activities to ensure a ready and resilient force.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report on Tuesday follows a recent string of scientific studies that warn that the effects of climate&nbsp;change are already occurring and that flooding, droughts, extreme storms, food and water shortages and damage to infrastructure will occur in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, the agency's main public document describing the current doctrine of the United States military, drew a direct link between the effects of global warming -- like rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns -- and terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad, such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions -- conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence,'' the review said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's report is an update of a report by the center's Military Advisory Board in 2007, the first major study to draw the link between climate&nbsp;change and national security. The report's authors said the biggest change in the seven years between the two studies was the increase in scientific certainty about global warming, and of the link between global warming and security disruptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2007 report also described climate&nbsp;change as a ''threat multiplier'' or a problem that could enhance or contribute to already existing causes of global disruption. The 2014 report updates that language, calling climate&nbsp;change a ''catalyst for conflict'' -- a phrase intentionally chosen, the report's authors said, to signal that climate&nbsp;change is an active, driving force in starting conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the past, the thinking was that climate&nbsp;change multiplied the significance of a situation,'' said Gen. Charles F. Wald, who contributed to both reports and is retired from the Air Force. ''Now we're saying it's going to be a direct cause of instability.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent scientific reports on climate&nbsp;change warn that increasing drought in Africa is now turning arable land to desert. The national security report's authors conclude that the slow but steady expansion of the Sahara through Mali, which is killing crops and leaving farmers starving, may have been a contributing force in the jihadist uprising in that African country in 2012. Since then, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has seized control of northern Mali and remains in conflict with the Malian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report warns that rising sea levels in the United States imperil many of the Navy's coastal installations. Last week, the White House released a National Climate Assessment report citing Norfolk, Va., as one of the cities most vulnerable to damage by rising sea levels. Norfolk is home to the world's largest naval base as well as a nuclear submarine construction yard -- all of which are vulnerable to destruction by rising sea levels, found in Tuesday's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Norfolk is so big, it's so important to the Navy, it's important to Virginia for jobs, and it would go,'' General Wald said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scientific report released this week found that global warming has contributed to the melting of a large section of a West Antarctica ice sheet, which could lead to a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a vocal skeptic of the established science that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming, scoffed at the idea that climate&nbsp;change is linked to national security threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is no one in more pursuit of publicity than a retired military officer,'' he said of the report's authors. ''I look back wistfully at the days of the Cold War. Now you have people who are mentally imbalanced, with the ability to deploy a nuclear weapon. For anyone to say that any type of global warming is anywhere close to the threat that we have with crazy people running around with nuclear weapons, it shows how desperate they are to get the public to buy this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rear Adm. David Titley, a co-author of the report and a meteorologist who is retired from the Navy, said political opposition would not extinguish what he called the indisputable data in the report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A novelist, an astrobiologist and an ecologist explore the impact of centuries of rising seas. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After finishing my post on the inevitability of substantial long-term sea-level rise from Antarctic ice loss, I sent this question to Curt Stager, a paleoclimatologist and author of &quot;Deep Future,&quot; Kim Stanley Robinson, the novelist focused on &quot;cli fi&quot; before that term was conceived, and the astrobiologist David Grinspoon:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given your focus on long timescales, environmental change and the human journey, I'm wondering if you might do quick riffs on how humans - in your view - will most likely deal with this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are their responses: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curt Stager, Paul Smith's College:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extra sea level rise due to the collapse of West Antarctic ice masses will play out over several centuries. It's not like you'll take your kids to the beach, leave them on a towel while you go to the snack bar for some ice cream, and then come back to find them washed out to sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When such changes are so slow, it's hard for people to notice or even believe in them. Major coastal cities from Tokyo to Venice to New Orleans have already been dealing with the equivalent of catastrophic sea level rise for decades, thanks to land subsidence from the extraction of groundwater or hydrocarbons, but you rarely hear about that. It's the sudden, extreme changes that we notice, and most of us will mainly experience chronic sea level rise in the form of sporadic storm surges that drive higher and farther inland than expected - as happened with Hurricane Sandy. It will be our challenge to connect those dots to expose the underlying trend, and to recognize our role in causing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, though, the apparent inevitability of such a large melt-off alone is shocking. It means that coastal cities I know and wild places like the Everglades that I love are now living on borrowed time, even if we could switch to non-fossil fuels fairly soon. The inundation may take centuries, but hearing that it may be un-stoppable makes it harder to ignore. These are huge changes we're setting in motion - slow, yes - but huge nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from our responses to the sea level rise of the past century, our responses to the ongoing rise will probably vary wildly. New Jersey is seemingly trying to rebuild its shoreline communities as fast as possible with little thought for the future, politicians in North Carolina have essentially told coastal planners not to take future sea level rise into account, and some places would like to resist or adapt but lack the resources to do so. On the other hand, the Netherlands and New York are actively preparing for higher sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not so much a question of science as of human nature. Imagine the stink we would all raise if another nation tried to take even one inch of our coastline away from us - and yet here is a slow taking of countless square miles from our shores by a carbon-driven ocean-turned-invader. We've become a major force of nature in this new Anthropocene epoch; politics and psychology have now become branches of ecology, and how we think, feel, and act has consequences of geological scope that will echo deep into the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're going to lose a lot of ice and a lot of coast with it, but there's still time to avoid de-icing the planet entirely. As Washington governor Jay Inslee recently said, we're the first generation to feel the sting of climate&nbsp;change, and the last generation who can do something about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Grinspoon, Library of Congress:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How will we deal with this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, as you point out, sea level in itself will not have much of a drastic effect for a long time. Yet it is rightfully something people should be concerned about - because people need to become aware of longer timescales, and of problems that will increasingly affect our descendants. But its also fascinating and somewhat terrifying to realize that if this study is right then within centuries we may have to abandon or radically change so many low lying centers of human habitation and activity. A friend of mine joked on Facebook today about becoming a gondolier in New York City. I bet even if it comes to that we won't abandon places like New York, but they may become unrecognizable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flooding of low-lying densely populated areas and potential changes to the global circulation system upon which agriculture depends - these are even harder problems than fixing cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think if our society is around for several more centuries we will have to have found different ways to deal collectively with our world-changing technologies. If we've made it that far, we'll find ways to adapt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the shorter run it adsd to my concern that we are unleashing changes to the Earth system that we don't actually know how to predict very well. I don't have confidence in our ability to very precisely predict the responses of the Earth system, and that makes me more concerned about results like this, not less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim Stanley Robinson:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think maybe you could connect up this growing awareness of long time or deep time, in human civilization, with the previously noted increase in our sense of spatial reach, that sense that we are now all part of a single global civilization, the &quot;global village&quot; notion. Our sense of space and time has extended to the global, so we think in planetary terms in both now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus although I believe strongly in thinking hard about our paleolithic roots as indicators of our mental and civilizational capabilities (see my most recent novel &quot;Shaman&quot;) I also think we are changing culturally, and can now think on the scale of centuries, and plan and act accordingly as a civilization. So this news is germane even though it is very long-range in its implications. We can think that long now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was in Antarctica in 1995, what the glaciologists were saying about the WAIS [West Antarctic Ice Sheet], is that its changes will mostly likely take a long time, but there was a wild card, in that there are volcanoes under that ice, and if one were to erupt, things could change very quickly. Now they have found signs that those volcanoes are at least active, if not fully erupting. This was the scenario I pursued at the end of my &quot;Green Mars,' and in &quot;Blue Mars&quot; all the coastal cities are flooded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my recent novel &quot;2312&quot; I describe an 11-meter sea level rise that is the result of a similar abrupt change. Manhattan is like Venice, fully functioning, indeed &quot;better than ever&quot; as they say in that time; a setting I plan to return to next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was when the ice core data in Greenland established the three-year onset of the Younger Dryas that the geologists had to invent the term &quot;abrupt climate&nbsp;change&quot; because they had so frequently abused the word &quot;quick&quot; sometimes meaning several thousand years when they said that. Thus the appearance of &quot;Abrupt Climate&nbsp;Change&quot; as a term (and a National Research Council book in 2002).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea level rise is not likely to be abrupt, but merely &quot;quick,&quot; unless one of those volcanoes erupts, in which case all bets are off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think global civilization will take this new data in, and it will increase the urgency of the decarbonization efforts. Then there will be a long period of adaptation to the climate&nbsp;change and sea level rise already caused and almost inevitable. Maybe geo-engineering will get more discussion and maybe someday some geo-engineering will even be attempted, if conditions get desperate enough. The infrastructure efforts in all the coastal areas of the world could be thought of as simply the necessary human work, maybe even a full employment program of sorts. Intertidal real estate might be a thing: see the Manhattan in my &quot;2312,&quot; or the London in my &quot;Blue Mars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strange to think, I've been imagining these scenarios for 25 years now. Talk about long time scales! It means I am old. But even as short as our times are, we can still imagine centuries and plan for them, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Postscript | There are others I'd like to hear from, including Annalee Newitz, the io9 editor and author of &quot;Scatter, Adapt and Remember,&quot; the novelist Barbara Kingsolver and perhaps Wolfgang Lutz, a population analyst at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why Lutz?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While glaciologists are modeling the long-term fate of ice sheets (and sea levels), he's modeling the fate of human populations through 2300. In an important 2008 paper, he and his co-author, Sergei Scherbov, charted a substantial prospect of a non-calamitous path toward 2 to 4 billion of us living prosperously on a thriving planet. Other paths head to 30 billion or more. (A 2013 paper builds on this work.) One of those outcomes is probably a more sustainable fit with retreating shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does this matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to keep track of the human factor in charting environmental risks, whether of our making or &quot;natural,&quot; given that vulnerability to a hazard - coastal or otherwise - is a function of both thescope of the threat and the amount of exposure (and the resilience of those exposed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How will humans respond?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glacier analysis in Antarctica provides a good view both of the scope of changes humans are setting in motion in the &quot;age of us,&quot; the Anthropocene, and the (still poorly understood) complexity of the systems we're nudging. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an e-mail exchange with my friend Tom Yulsman, who also wrote about the Antarctic news, I said this in reflecting on broader implications of these findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realities of sea-level rise and Antarctic trends and China's emissions, etc., make me feel ever more confident that the [bend, stretch, reach, teach] shift I charted for my goals in my TEDx talk (away from numbers and toward qualities) is the right path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's your path?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan bill to encourage energy efficiency in buildings died in the Senate on Monday, derailed by the contentious debate over the Keystone XL pipeline and President Obama's plans to issue new climate&nbsp;change regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's end came as the Senate voted 55 to 36 on a procedural motion, falling five votes short of the 60 required to bring the bill to a final vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure, sponsored by Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, was a rarity in today's political environment: Until last week, it had widespread support from members of both parties in both chambers of Congress. A companion bill in the House, sponsored by Representatives David B. McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, and Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, has also drawn strong bipartisan backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional staff members have been working behind the scenes for nearly a year to draft a consensus version of the bill that party leaders in both chambers could endorse. Just a few weeks ago, leaders of both parties were optimistic that the Senate bill would show that bipartisan agreement is still possible in a gridlocked Capitol and pave the way for a broader energy bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Welch, in talking about the unusual agreement on the bill, said, ''It was like a snowstorm in July in Vermont.'' And it was an issue that had united Mr. Welch, a New England liberal, and Representative Eric Cantor, the conservative House majority leader from Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But partisan differences emerged last week as the bill came to the Senate floor for debate and Republicans pushed for amendments, including one that would approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast and another to block Mr. Obama's efforts to issue climate&nbsp;change rules without congressional action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, refused to let the amendments come up for a vote, leading to a standoff from which neither side backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Today's failure to move forward on a bipartisan energy-efficiency bill is yet another disappointing example of Washington's dysfunction,'' Mr. Portman said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been seven years since Congress has passed a major energy bill, and a variety of energy issues have become top concerns since then. There is the push to combat global warming, which scientists say is made worse by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the debate over hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which environmentalists fear will contaminate water supplies but which also has led to a boom in oil and gas. The crisis in Ukraine, which depends on Russia for its energy supplies, has also raised questions about whether the United States should export its gas and crude oil to achieve its foreign policy goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modest energy-efficiency bill would not have addressed any of those issues. It was a bundle of small-bore provisions aimed at cutting homeowners' energy use, utility bills and carbon footprints by, among other measures, making it easier for consumers to buy ''smart metered'' water heaters and making it cheaper for manufacturers to build energy-efficient cooling and heating systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These aren't huge, bold things. But this is larger than losing this energy-efficiency bill,'' said Margot Anderson, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Energy Project. ''What gets lost is any momentum on energy. People are worried that if we can't even pass that, we're not in good shape to tackle the bigger stuff. We can't even get warmed up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late last week, it had become clear that the fight over the Keystone pipeline and Mr. Obama's climate&nbsp;change regulations, both of which have become issues in the 2014 elections, had overshadowed the debate over energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has repeatedly delayed a decision on whether to approve the proposed 1,700-mile pipeline, which would carry 830,000 barrels a day of carbon-heavy crude from Canada's Alberta oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. The pipeline has become a political weapon for Republicans, who say it would create jobs and help ensure energy security for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four vulnerable Senate Democrats -- Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas -- have sought to distance themselves from Mr. Obama by supporting the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have also sought to use the climate&nbsp;change regulations that Mr. Obama is expected to announce soon -- which will target coal-fired power plants, the nation's largest source of carbon pollution -- for political purposes by accusing Democrats of waging a ''war on coal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the Republican amendments had failed, party leaders had hoped the votes would put some incumbent Democrats on the spot. Republicans also argued that it was appropriate to offer energy-related amendments to an energy bill -- especially given that it was the first such legislation on the floor in seven years. After a week of negotiations, the two sides reached an impasse, and the energy-efficiency bill was the casualty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, was a co-sponsor of the legislation, and her spokesman, Robert Dillon, said, ''It's embarrassing that even an energy-efficiency bill can't get past the floor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We used to have hundreds of votes on amendments. Now it's all politics all the time. It's all rhetoric,'' Mr. Dillon said. ''It's frustrating to Republicans, and it's frustrating to Democrats. There's a lot of pent-up demand to have a real debate on energy.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive of Ecotricity talks Tories, climate change and why he can offer customers a cheaper tariff than the 'big six'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time I interviewed Dale Vince eight years ago, his renewables company Ecotricity - then just starting to make an impact in the energy sector - was housed in a smallish building smack bang next to Stroud railway station. I didn't dare confess I'd driven all the way from Manchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the company is becoming a green energy empire: it's already outgrown its new roomier glass-walled premise and Vince is about to install ever greater numbers of his famously friendly call-handlers in a vast office block adorned with Ecotricity banners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the &quot;big six&quot; companies that sell 98% of the country's power now offer a green tariff - which may be why Ecotricity recently signed up its 100,000th customer to a pricing model that directs the profits from energy bills straight back into commissioning new green energy generation capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince, an intense and driven figure yet somehow extraordinarily relaxed, believes that for our energy-guzzling society to survive, his model is the only sustainable solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The energy crisis that I see is in our current, almost complete dependence on fossil fuels,&quot; he states. &quot;As the stuff runs out, global markets become tighter, demand from the developing world and China rises, the cost of fossil fuels goes up and that's the main reason for the escalation in energy bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 75% to 80% of Britain's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. That's without counting the 25m tonnes of oil a year that powers our cars, lorries, trains and planes, he explains. Or the gas that's used domestically, in industry and to produce fertilisers. Or the fossil fuels needed for dairy and meat production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy, transport and food: we depend on fossil fuels in all three sectors. As a country, it's a near total dependence,&quot; says Vince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How bad will the energy crisis be, I ask, and how fast will it hit? &quot;I don't see it being apocalyptic, because fossil fuels aren't going to run out like that.&quot; He clicks his fingers for impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll be an agonising process, like the decline of the Roman Empire; it'll take decades. We have lived through a period of abundant and cheap fossil fuels. It's unprecedented, unparalleled in all of human history - and as that comes to an end, our world will fundamentally change. The pain is going to be quite incredible. So many people will be in fuel poverty because by definition 10% of their income has to go on rising energy bills. And if you overlay climate&nbsp;change on that scenario - storms, colder weather, messed-up weather, all of which will also make our lives harder - it's going to be a crazy time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince is frustrated (though not surprised) that there is so little government support for renewables, despite the fact that in other European countries, green generation methods now make up around 30% of energy use. Do policymakers invite him into Whitehall strategy groups to talk about the future of energy generation? He raises a quizzical eyebrow. &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm surprised: Vince is a successful businessman who has made significant money from Ecotricity, as well as opting to invest much of the profits in new green energy capacity and pioneering renewable generation methods. His model clearly works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our method has always been to do what we think is the right thing, and to try and demonstrate by doing rather than talking. I don't believe [Cameron's] party believes climate&nbsp;change is real - they certainly aren't addressing it in any way that would suggest they think it's real, with the rowing back on solar and wind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the high-level opposition that renewable energy projects pitch themselves against, there must be something that keeps him going. &quot;A dark sense of humour?&quot; Vince suggests. &quot;Governments come and governments go, and it's only a matter of time before we feel the increasing pressure. The floods in Somerset were useful in that respect. Extreme weather is a good wake-up call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all governments tend to focus on cost today rather than cake tomorrow. If avoiding his prophesy of a long, painful decline involves massive investment in renewable energy, then Vince acknowledges that the compelling question becomes, can we afford it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our premise is to say: 'Everybody has to have an energy bill; nobody really wants one, but let's at least do something good with it and use the proceeds to look at sources of green energy',&quot; he says. &quot;We harness our customer's energy bills and we use the proceeds to build new [wind]mills. Doing that has seen us become 40% energy independent by last summer - that means 40% of the energy we supply, we make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This success has enabled Ecotricity to charge a cheaper tariff than the &quot;big six&quot; for the first time. Vince projects the next change will be a price reduction, not an increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point that I want to make,&quot; Vince concludes, &quot;is that as a small company with no big backers and no deep pockets, our model enables us to outspend every other electricity company in the country put together, per customer, on renewable energy. We see ourselves as a micro version of what could happen for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China emerges as top employer, followed by US and Brazil, but employment in the UK is stagnating</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people working in the global renewable energy industry grew by 14% to 6.5m in 2013, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). However, employment in renewable energy in the UK is stagnating, according to the most recent government data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest renewable sector employer worldwide is the solar panel industry, which employed 2.27m people, according to Irena, a body comprising 168 member nations. Biofuels, with 1.45m, and wind power, with 0.83m, were the next biggest employers. The largest employer by country is China, with 2.6m jobs. Two-thirds of these jobs are in solar, in which employment has trebled in two years. Brazil, with 0.89m jobs, and the US, with 0.63m, are the next biggest renewable employment nations, with both countries having large biofuel sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With 6.5 million people directly or indirectly employed in renewable energy, the sector is proving that it is no longer a niche - it has become a significant employer worldwide,&quot; said Irena director-general Adnan Z Amin. A major recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change concluded that low-carbon energy output needs to treble by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of solar photovoltaic panels has fallen rapidly in recent years and the report identifies increasing installations as the main driver behind the jobs rise. &quot;Surging demand for solar PV in China and Japan has increased employment in the installation sector,&quot; said Rabia Ferroukhi, lead author of the Irena report. &quot;Consequently some Chinese manufacturers are now adding capacity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the outlook for solar in the UK is uncertain with the fourth review of subsidies in less than three years expected imminently. Leonie Greene, at the UK's Renewable Energy Associationm said: &quot;The government is in danger of pushing the whole non-domestic solar PV sector of a cliff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the Guardian: &quot;We are happy to discuss cost reductions with the government but let's do it on the basis of evidence. This latest review seems to be purely political and reactionary.&quot; While solar power is overwhelmingly the most popular technology in the UK, some large solar farms have generated local opposition and Conservative energy minister Greg Barker has called them &quot;monsters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Solar jobs in the UK were growing nicely and we had lots of member companies taking on new staff,&quot; said Greene. &quot;Whether that continues depends on what happens on Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent UK government statistics on the wider &pound;128bn green economy show it employed almost a million people in 2011-12 - more than teaching - and grew at 4.8%, far outstripping the whole economy. The data includes the clean energy, waste, water and pollution sectors but showed that the number employed in the renewable energy sector was static compared to the previous year at about 275,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar has also suffered from government subsidy cuts in Australia, according to the Irena report. It said the 23,000 solar jobs on 2012 is expected to fall to 12,300 in 2014. The Irena report found employment in the wind sector had also suffered from uncertainty over state policies, particularly in the US, Europe and India. But this was offset by positive moves in China and Canada, the report said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everywhere you look these days, you see Marxism on the rise. Well, O.K., maybe you don't -- but conservatives do. If you so much as mention income inequality, you'll be denounced as the second coming of Joseph Stalin; Rick Santorum has declared that any use of the word ''class'' is ''Marxism talk.'' In the right's eyes, sinister motives lurk everywhere -- for example, George Will says the only reason progressives favor trains is their goal of ''diminishing Americans' individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it goes without saying that Obamacare, based on ideas originally developed at the Heritage Foundation, is a Marxist scheme -- why, requiring that people purchase insurance is practically the same as sending them to gulags.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just wait until the Environmental Protection Agency announces rules intended to slow the pace of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, the right's climate craziness has mainly been focused on attacking the science. And it has been quite a spectacle: At this point almost all card-carrying conservatives endorse the view that climate&nbsp;change is a gigantic hoax, that thousands of research papers showing a warming planet -- 97 percent of the literature -- are the product of a vast international conspiracy. But as the Obama administration moves toward actually doing something based on that science, crazy climate economics will come into its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can already get a taste of what's coming in the dissenting opinions from a recent Supreme Court ruling on power-plant pollution. A majority of the justices agreed that the E.P.A. has the right to regulate smog from coal-fired power plants, which drifts across state lines. But Justice Scalia didn't just dissent; he suggested that the E.P.A.'s proposed rule -- which would tie the size of required smog reductions to cost -- reflected the Marxist concept of ''from each according to his ability.'' Taking cost into consideration is Marxist? Who knew?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you can just imagine what will happen when the E.P.A., buoyed by the smog ruling, moves on to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do I mean by crazy climate economics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we'll see any effort to limit pollution denounced as a tyrannical act. Pollution wasn't always a deeply partisan issue: Economists in the George W. Bush administration wrote paeans to ''market based'' pollution controls, and in 2008 John McCain made proposals for cap-and-trade limits on greenhouse gases part of his presidential campaign. But when House Democrats actually passed a cap-and-trade bill in 2009, it was attacked as, you guessed it, Marxist. And these days Republicans come out in force to oppose even the most obviously needed regulations, like the plan to reduce the pollution that's killing Chesapeake Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we'll see claims that any effort to limit emissions will have what Senator Marco Rubio is already calling ''a devastating impact on our economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this crazy? Normally, conservatives extol the magic of markets and the adaptability of the private sector, which is supposedly able to transcend with ease any constraints posed by, say, limited supplies of natural resources. But as soon as anyone proposes adding a few limits to reflect environmental issues -- such as a cap on carbon emissions -- those all-capable corporations supposedly lose any ability to cope with change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the rules the E.P.A. is likely to impose won't give the private sector as much flexibility as it would have had in dealing with an economywide carbon cap or emissions tax. But Republicans have only themselves to blame: Their scorched-earth opposition to any kind of climate policy has left executive action by the White House as the only route forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, it turns out that focusing climate policy on coal-fired power plants isn't bad as a first step. Such plants aren't the only source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they're a large part of the problem -- and the best estimates we have of the path forward suggest that reducing power-plant emissions will be a large part of any solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the argument that unilateral U.S. action won't work, because China is the real problem? It's true that we're no longer No. 1 in greenhouse gases -- but we're still a strong No. 2. Furthermore, U.S. action on climate is a necessary first step toward a broader international agreement, which will surely include sanctions on countries that don't participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the coming firestorm over new power-plant regulations won't be a genuine debate -- just as there isn't a genuine debate about climate science. Instead, the airwaves will be filled with conspiracy theories and wild claims about costs, all of which should be ignored. Climate policy may finally be getting somewhere; let's not let crazy climate economics get in the way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Senator Marco Rubio on Sunday said that he was ready to be president, becoming the second potential Republican candidate recently to drop big hints about 2016 as he vies for early attention in a crowded field of maybes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a wide-ranging interview on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC, Mr. Rubio, of Florida, also disagreed with accepted scientific wisdom that humans were having an effect on what he called the ''always evolving'' climate. ''I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,'' he said. ''And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments challenged a major scientific report released Tuesday that found the effects of human-induced climate&nbsp;change are being felt in every corner of the United States, from dry regions where water is becoming more scarce to historically wet regions that are seeing increases in torrential rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report. the National Climate Assessment, stated that the sweeping changes have been caused by an average warming of less than 2 degrees Fahrenheit over most land areas of the United States in the past century. If greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane continue to escalate at a rapid pace, the scientists said, the warming could conceivably exceed 10 degrees by the end of this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,'' they declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how big a threat he regarded climate&nbsp;change, Mr. Rubio replied: ''Our climate is always changing. And what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that's directly and almost solely attributable to man-made activities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his comments, Mr. Rubio became the first of three prominent Florida Republicans, including another potential presidential candidate, former Gov. Jeb Bush, to comment publicly on climate&nbsp;change following the release of the report, which named Miami as one of the cities most vulnerable to severe damage as a result of rising sea levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding his future political aspirations, Mr. Rubio said that while he would take until the end of the year to decide whether to seek his party's presidential nomination, he thought he had a ''vision'' for the nation's future and a strategy for achieving it, among other qualifications that he said he shared with other potential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I do,'' he said when asked whether he thought he was ready for the presidency. ''I mean, but I think that's true for multiple other people that would want to run.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rubio's assertion came a week after Gov. Rick Perry of Texas offered perhaps his clearest indication yet that he was considering another run, talking about his ''botched'' campaign in 2012 on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and emphasizing that Americans believe in ''second chances.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Rubio and Mr. Perry trailing other potential candidates like Mr. Bush and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, in recent polls, the remarks could be interpreted as an early attempt to stand out in a field where there is no front-runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tea Party darling who drew fire for working with Democrats on immigration reform, Mr. Rubio appeared intent on shoring up support among conservative voters. As House Republicans assemble a panel to further investigate the 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he also took a shot at another potential 2016 candidate: Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If she is going to run on her record as secretary of state, she's also going to have to answer for its massive failures,'' Mr. Rubio said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projected increases in China's coal consumption may render it &quot;almost impossible&quot; for the world to limit global temperature increases from greenhouse gases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the country acts quickly to cap and then reduce its dependency on the fossil fuel, a new study has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burning coal in China contributes one-fifth of the world's total emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, and if the country continues to increase its coal emissions through 2025 or beyond, it will make it &quot;almost impossible for the world to move onto an emissions reduction pathway that gives even a 50-50 probability of staying below&quot; 2 degrees Celsius, according to the study released on Monday by two British research centers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases, should cap its coal consumption by 2020 or sooner and take steps to eliminate its use entirely by 2040, the study by the Center for Climate&nbsp;Change Economics and Policy and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate&nbsp;Change and the Environment recommends. That can be done by improving efficiency, taxing coal and focusing on alternative energies such as wind and solar, the report said.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaning China from coal would provide many benefits, the authors, Fergus Green and Nicholas Stern, wrote in the report. Many of China's cities, especially in the country's north, are choking in pollution caused in part by coal-fired plants. Cleaner air would dramatically increase the quality of life, helping the government's push to accelerate urbanization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China is increasingly dependent on coal imports to feed its growing demand, so a move away from coal would give the country greater energy security and shield it from global price swings. Reducing coal consumption would also ease water shortages, especially in northern China, because of the great deal of water needed to generate power from coal and also to convert coal into gas. And because of the size of China's market, a push into alternative energies would make China a world leader in solar, wind and other energies, allowing it to develop new export markets, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nations meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 for a United Nations summit conference on curbing greenhouse gases agreed that the world should strive to keep temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times in order to limit rising sea levels and increasingly extreme weather conditions. The study cites figures showing that the maximum global carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions level in 2030 that will give a 50-50 chance of staying below a 2 degrees Celsius increase is 32-33 gigatons. Yet unless China curbs its coal use, it alone is forecast to exceed 15 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions by 2030, or almost half that total amount, the study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, China issued new rules that curtail the construction of new coal-fired plants in three major urban areas centered on Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. But poorer inland provinces continue to build new plants, viewing the power industry as key to economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese planners have proposed 363 new coal-fired plants, according to a November 2012 report by the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental advocacy group. Though many of those plants may never be built, their planned capacity is more than half again as much as the entire coal-fired output in the United States, according to United States Energy Information Administration figures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;He does not &amp;#8220;believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate.&amp;#8221; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If American presidents need to prove a basic ability to accept facts, then Senator Marco Rubio of Florida-who's publicly mulling a run- just disqualified himself from competition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with ABC on Sunday, days after the release of an alarming White House report on the present and future effects of climate&nbsp;change on the United States, Mr. Rubio said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.&quot;<BR><BR>There's something almost cute about the last part of that sentence-a hedge he can bring out in a general election if he's accused of willful stupidity. I'm not a climate-change denier, he might say, I just don't think scientists are giving us an accurate picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Mr. Rubio think scientists are lying? Or that they don't know what they're talking about? Either way, what leads him to believe that the &quot;portrait&quot; of climate&nbsp;change offered by scientists is inaccurate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, Mr. Rubio told a GQ reporter &quot;I'm not a scientist, man&quot;-when asked about the age of the earth. (He went on to say we may never know &quot;whether the earth was created in 7 days, or 7 actual eras&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he sounded science-y, if not scientific, when-on Sunday-he argued that &quot;our climate is always changing. And what [scientists] have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and-and say that this is now evidence of a longer-term trend that's directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that climate scientists have made a schoolboy error, and that he-Marco &quot;not a scientist, man&quot; Rubio-knows better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly funny since Mr. Rubio felt the need to point out last week that President Obama, who does believe in climate&nbsp;change, is &quot;not a meteorologist.&quot; Mr. Rubio may or may not know that there's a difference between climate science and meteorology; but, setting that aside, he's evidently aware-when it suits him-that there's a difference between scientific and political expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio defenders might argue that it doesn't matter whether or not the senator thinks &quot;human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate&quot;-so long as he's willing to do something about those dramatic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't agree with the notion that some are putting out there, including scientists, that somehow, there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on what's happening in our climate,&quot; he said on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later he added, &quot;I have no problem with taking mitigation activity. What I have a problem with is these changes to our law that somehow politicians say are going to change our weather. That's absurd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the kicker: Mr. Rubio sits on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and the Subcommittee on Science and Space.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In the New Mexico of the 1950s, the two brothers grew up steeped in the beauty of the landscape, the economics of energy and the power of science. They skied, fly-fished, explored on the family's 50,000-acre sheep ranch, watched oil towns go boom and bust, and talked of the nuclear weapons up the road at Los Alamos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the work of Robert and William Nordhaus is profoundly shaping how the United States and other nations take on global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Nordhaus, 72, a Yale economist who is seen as a leading contender for a Nobel Prize, came up with the idea of a carbon tax and effectively invented the economics of climate&nbsp;change. Bob, 77, a prominent Washington energy lawyer, wrote an obscure provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970 that is now the legal basis for a landmark climate&nbsp;change regulation, to be unveiled by the White House next month, that could close hundreds of coal-fired power plants and define President Obama's environmental legacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called the Manning brothers of climate&nbsp;change, the mild-mannered, dry-witted Nordhauses are scions of a New Mexico family long rooted in the land, which powerfully shaped who the brothers became. But for the Nordhaus brothers, protecting the earth depends far more on dispassionate thinking and intellectual rigor than on showy protests outside the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have neatly divided their world -- Bill is the academic theorist, Bob the legal mind and political pragmatist -- but their work is intertwined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I tend to have lots of crazy ideas, and I run them by Bob first,'' Bill said by phone from the Acela train between Boston and New Haven, Conn. He described himself as ''an academic economist'' who has stayed out of policy debates, although his ideas have not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob agreed. ''Bill's work is about what needs to be done and how soon, using the tools of economic analysis,'' he said over a recent lunch in Washington. ''My work is: How do you convert that into a legal and regulatory policy?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two have a friendly rivalry, but both believe that cutting carbon pollution is crucial to protecting the environment and the economy from the risks posed by climate&nbsp;change. They also agree on the best way to do it: A Bill-style carbon tax, they say, would be far more effective and efficient than a Bob-style regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their story starts in Albuquerque, where their father, the grandson of a wealthy Santa Fe merchant, started the ski resort at the top of Albuquerque's Sandia Peak and with a partner built the city's iconic tram up the granite cliffs to get there. A specialist in energy and Native American law, Robert Nordhaus Sr. won a Supreme Court case giving Apache tribes the authority to levy fees on the oil companies that drilled on their native land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like him, both brothers went east to Yale, where in 1963 Bob graduated from the law school and Bill from Yale College. From there Bob headed to Washington for a job as a staff lawyer in the House legislative counsel's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was still there in 1970, working on the bill that would become the Clean Air Act, when his bosses came to him with an unusual assignment: The legislation already included language to regulate known pollutants, such as mercury and smog, but could he write a provision giving the federal government the authority to regulate as-yet-unknown pollutants of the future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob wrote the provision -- it became Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act -- at a time when carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, was not considered harmful. It was not until 2009 that the Environmental Protection Agency defined carbon dioxide as a harmful pollutant because of its contribution to global warming. Thus it falls into the category of an unknown ''pollutant of the future.'' Section 111(d), after languishing in obscurity for decades, is now the legal rationale for the Obama administration's plan to regulate carbon emissions without a law passed by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Bob began his career in Washington, Bill received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began teaching at Yale. By the late 1970s, when an increasing number of scientists were raising the threat of global warming, Bill wrote a paper proposing a tax on industries and businesses based on the amount of carbon they emitted into the air. The idea was revolutionary at the time, but economists, scientists and many world leaders now say it will have a powerful market effect and is the best way to stave off the catastrophic impacts of a warming world. Already, more than 30 countries have passed carbon-pricing laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ensuing decades at Yale, Bill developed an economic model that put a price tag on the effects of climate&nbsp;change, like more droughts, flooding and crop failures and stronger hurricanes. He called it the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, or DICE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The name was both descriptive (representing a dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) but also consciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet,'' Bill wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DICE profoundly changed climate policy. Although the chief political argument against curbing carbon emissions from cars and coal plants has long been that doing so would harm the economy, the DICE models show that, depending on various scenarios, one ton of carbon pollution can inflict $20 to $30 in economic damage -- a major cost, given that the global economy emits about 36 billion tons of carbon a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill's work ''was seminal,'' said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is, for the time being, politically untenable in the United States. The conservative Heritage Foundation has called the DICE model ''flawed beyond use for policy making'' and warned that it should not be used to justify ''trillions of dollars of government policies and burdensome regulations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here the work of Bob comes in: Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a carbon-pricing bill through Congress in his first term, which is why he has turned to Bob's section of the Clean Air Act as the legal underpinning for the regulation due out in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob, who was an energy adviser to President Jimmy Carter and general counsel at the Department of Energy under President Bill Clinton, now says that because he was not writing the provision with climate&nbsp;change in mind, the new regulation is an imperfect and perhaps legally vulnerable solution to regulating carbon pollution. Environmental lawyers note that it has almost never been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I call it the 40-year-old virgin,'' said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one way the E.P.A. will justify the new regulation is with an analysis showing that the economic benefits of the climate&nbsp;change rule would outweigh the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A core component of that analysis? The DICE model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in New Mexico, Bob recalled, he and Bill -- the oldest and youngest brothers among four siblings -- could not help noticing the changing world of energy around them. In the 1950s, he said, as the Los Alamos weapons program expanded, the state changed ''from a pastoral economy, split between ranching, irrigated farming and extractive industries, to defense-related work, which was a whole different world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also paid close attention to the climate&nbsp;changes, and periodic droughts, that affected the family ski business and their lives outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Growing up in New Mexico,'' he said, ''you're aware of the very fragile ecosystem.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first in our series of debates on the future of UK energy exposes a fragile, disjointed system in need of direction. Neil Brady reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Ofgem's recent call for an inquiry into evidence of profiteering at the big six energy firms, and Labour placing energy at the centre of its electoral strategy for 2015, the UK is facing a national debate about how we power our economy - and how we pay for it. But the energy sector is a complex mosaic of competing interests and imperatives, with no quick fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping the lights on by securing a balanced mix of energy sources is a tough challenge, but one boldy taken on by delegates at last month's Guardian roundtable event in Westminster, part of the #bigenergy series.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants asked whether deregulation of the UK energy industry had laid the foundation for the modernisation of the sector that was now required. While the process has seen some successes, opportunities have been missed too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're now at a stage where we [as a country] need to heavily invest, and because of the way we've set things up, it's in an environment of huge market and political risk, and expense,&quot; said Matthew Knight, director of strategy and government affairs at Siemens Energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Lilley, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden and a member of the energy and climate&nbsp;change committee, was closely involved in the process of deregulation as a cabinet minister. He said it had improved the way energy is generated but there had been fewer benefits to transmission and distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as generation is concerned, productivity rose by two thirds in three years, and so did the efficiency of use of fuel. In transmission, the main achievement was to separate regulation from ownership - but I'm not sure we made full advantage of that. In distribution, if I could start over I think I'd ensure that that process is co-operatively owned. At present ... all we have is competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most experts at the table agreed that the complexity of the UK's energy landscape in 2014 had become a challenge as we face our energy &quot;trilemma&quot;. Duncan Botting, a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology energy policy panel, explained: &quot;From an engineering perspective, the whole system needs to be looked at. Our achilles heel is that we have a fragmented delivery vehicle. Little of [the system] is coordinated, meaning that investments which could be made by one facet can't be made because others haven't invested at the same time. At the end of the day, the only person with complete oversight of the system is government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Oxburgh, geologist and former non-executive chairman of Shell, agreed. &quot;When it comes to major infrastructure like roads or energy, you have to have a national view, within which private industry can give you the best answer. Bear in mind what markets [often] provide is not the cheapest solution, not the best solution but the most readily financeable solution, and in the case of energy they're often different things,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour MP Julie Elliott said her party's price freeze commitment was &quot;a means to an end&quot;. &quot;Our policy is about restructuring the way things are working, and to that end we're proposing the energy security board, which will have that overview, and power to intervene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet energy supply is critical to our national well being. Shouldn't it be insulated not just from the vagaries of the market, but also politics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had something like 15 energy ministers over the last dozen years,&quot; noted Lord Oxburgh. &quot;There has to be some informed and experienced group that takes a longer view, to avoid the issue becoming a political football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welsh Labour MP Albert Owen said there were also lessons for the UK about the politics of energy supply from the impasse between Russia and Ukraine. &quot;If we're talking about the national interest, I think transmission and distribution should be run as not-for-profit. We talk about ... the implications of something like Ukraine, but we leave storage in this regard to the markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, delegates could agree on one thing: the urgent need for greater stability in our energy supply. Cordi O'Hara, director of market operations at National Grid, reinforced the point, admitting it was crucial for her organisation to build new energy networks for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're responsible for the real-time balancing of the energy mix on a day-to-day basis, but don't control the future of it. For me in my job, energy security is sacrosanct, and in that trilemma there's a trade off between what's affordable and what's sustainable, and that's not an easy trade off to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Islamist militancy in Nigeria is being strengthened by western and regional fossil fuel interests</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian school girls, and the massacre of as many as 300 civilians in the town of Gamboru Ngala, by the militant al-Qaeda affiliated group, Boko Haram, has shocked the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while condemnations have rightly been forthcoming from a whole range of senior figures from celebrities to government officials, less attention has been paid to the roots of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instability in Nigeria, however, has been growing steadily over the last decade - and one reason is climate&nbsp;change. In 2009, a UK Department for International Development (Dfid) study warned that climate&nbsp;change could contribute to increasing resource shortages in the country due to land scarcity from desertification, water shortages, and mounting crop failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more recent study by the Congressionally-funded US Institute for Peace confirmed a &quot;basic causal mechanism&quot; that &quot;links climate&nbsp;change with violence in Nigeria.&quot; The report concludes:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...poor responses to climatic shifts create shortages of resources such as land and water. Shortages are followed by negative secondary impacts, such as more sickness, hunger, and joblessness. Poor responses to these, in turn, open the door to conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, a business-as-usual scenario sees Nigeria's climate undergoing &quot;growing shifts in temperature, rainfall, storms, and sea levels throughout the twenty-first century. Poor adaptive responses to these shifts could help fuel violent conflict in some areas of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the late Prof Sabo Bako of Ahmadu Bello University, the 1980s &quot;forerunner&quot; to Boko Haram was the Maitatsine sect in northern Nigeria, whose members included many victims of ecological disasters leaving them in &quot;a chaotic state of absolute poverty and social dislocation in search of food, water, shelter, jobs, and means of livelihood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year after the USIP study, Africa Review reported that many Boko Haram foot soldiers happen to be people displaced by severe drought and food shortages in the neighbouring Niger and Chad. Some 200,000 farmers and herdsman had lost their livelihoods and, facing starvation, crossed the border to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While a good number of these men were found in major cities like Lagos,&quot; pushing water carts and repatriating their earnings to the families they left behind,&quot; said Africa Review, &quot;others were believed to have been lured by the Boko Haram.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, one retired Nigerian security official told the journal that the Nigerian military recognised a correlation between regional climatic events, and an upsurge in extremist violence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has become a pattern; we saw it happen in 2006; it happened again in 2008 and in 2010. If you remember, President (Olusegun) Obasanjo had to deploy the military in 2006 to Yobe State, Borno State and Katsina State. These are some of the states bordering Niger Republic and today they are the hotbeds of the Boko Haram.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other issues is Nigeria's intensifying energy crisis. In recent months, the country has faced a fuel crisis partly due to the government slashing previously high fuel subsidies, contributing to increasing public anger and civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while corruption and ageing infrastructure play an important role, the end of cheap oil is the real elephant in the room. One study by two Nigerian scholars concluded in 2011 that &quot;there is an imminent decline in Nigeria's oil reserve since peaking could have occurred or just about to occur; this is shown to be in agreement with previous studies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one senior Shell official in March this year, crude oil production decline rates are &quot;as high as 15 to 20 per cent.&quot; Replacing this &quot;natural production decline rate... requires more funds than is currently available.&quot; The same month, the head of Nigeria's petroleum resources department called for more investment in exploration to offset rapid decline rates:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oil reserves are dropping, our output is dropping too... We need to do more in this regards to have more reserves. We have reached the plateau of production in the Niger Delta and we are already going down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With such domestic oil production challenges undermining Nigeria's oil export revenues, the fuel subsidy slash has pushed the brunt of the crisis onto the population, escalating the poverty and inequality that is a recruiting sergeant for Islamist terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram hail from, there is little evidence of an oil boom. With about 70% of the population subsisting on less than a dollar a day - some 20% higher than the already dismal rate in the south, rates of illiteracy and illness are endemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted by David Francis, one of the first western reporters to cover Boko Haram, &quot;Most of the foot soldiers of Boko Haram aren't Muslim fanatics; they're poor kids who were turned against their corrupt country by a charismatic leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the fact that the west has been content to turn a blind eye to these problems by propping up the corrupt Nigerian government while accelerating oil and gas deals, there is a further complication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abundant evidence shows that al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) have exploitedthe rise of Boko Haram to gain increasing controlof the Nigerian militant movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we're not being told, however, is that al-Qaeda's rapid expansion through northwest Africa has occurred under the rubric of Algerian state intelligence services - with US, French and British knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our relationship with the Algerian military junta, responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of civilians, is driven by the usual unquenchable thirst to access what the US energy department estimates are the world's third largest shale gas reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Prof Jeremy Keenan, a leading Algeria expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies who advises the US State Department, European Union, and Foreign Office on regional security issues, AQIM's expansion across north Africa has focused on oil-rich nations - particularly Algeria, Niger Delta, Nigeria, and Chad; the latter three precisely where Boko Haram has reportedly received terrorist training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a decade ago, Keenan reports, these countries signed a &quot;co-operation agreement on counter-terrorism that effectively joined the two oil-rich sides of the Sahara together in a complex of security arrangements whose architecture is American.&quot; The agreement evolved into the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Initiative, which was eventually absorbed into the US Army's African Command (AFRICOM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keenan argues that the west's oil and gas greed has caused our governments to turn a blind eye to the role of oil states like Algeria in fostering regional terrorism - instead exploiting the resulting chaos to legitimise efforts to consolidate access to remaining African energy reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this analysis is correct, then the hundreds of innocent girls kidnapped in Nigeria are not just victims of Islamist fanaticism; they are also victims of failed foreign, economic and security policies tied to our infernal addiction to black gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate sceptic organisation founded by former chancellor Nigel Lawson is to set up a new campaigning arm, which would be free from charity regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is classified as an educational charity and thus covered by strict Charity Commission rules that restrict its ability to conduct political campaigns, said that the new non-charitable company would undertake &quot;activities which do not fall squarely within the educational remit of the charity&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar structures are also used by some other non-profit organisations, because it gives them greater freedom in lobbying and in some commercial activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new arm, to be called the Global Warming Policy Forum, will share the same website and initials and publish reports and research papers, as well as organising lectures and debates on science and policy. In particular, it will put out news articles and opinion columns through a section of its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Charity Commission agrees with the restructuring, the new organisation will start operating by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, last year complained to the Charity Commission, over what he saw as the dissemination by the GWPF of &quot;misleading and inaccurate&quot; information. Charity Commission rules require organisations granted charitable status - which allows them, and their donors, to benefit from favourable tax treatment - to ensure that any information they put out is fair and as accurate as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward said: &quot;I think it is apparent that this move is designed to get around Charity Commission rules that specify that it must not disseminate inaccurate information. It is a deeply cynical move by the Foundation to avoid any formal requirement that they should stop misleading the public with inaccurate information. However, I hope now that it will be more obvious that when Lord Lawson speaks about climate&nbsp;change, it is as a campaigner rather than as an expert. And at least its secret donors will no longer be able to claim tax relief on funding the Foundation's political propaganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace, which was named by the GWPF as an organisation that operates a campaigning arm as well as its core charity, told the Guardian: &quot;They do say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&quot; But he said that if Lord Lawson really wants to emulate Greenpeace's structure he should be open about where his funding comes from and &quot;root his political campaign in the reality of climate science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GWPF does not disclose the names of organisations or individuals who provide its funding, but says that fossil fuel companies are not among them. It did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''The Right Lessons From Chernobyl'' (editorial, May 2):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The danger posed by nuclear power goes far beyond the catastrophic accidents that have occurred at Chernobyl and Fukushima. As the nuclear weapon programs of North Korea, Pakistan, Israel, India and perhaps Iran have shown, civilian nuclear power programs are inextricably linked with the technology needed to develop nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot promote nuclear power as a source of electricity and also expect to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation, a development that poses as great a threat to humanity as global warming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, nuclear power is not an inexpensive bridge to an energy system based on renewable sources. It competes for resources with renewables, diverting money from the very technologies we need to promote. Numerous studies provide blueprints for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources more cheaply and quickly than nuclear power can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time to abandon the myth of the peaceful atom and focus on building a renewable energy system that meets the needs of all people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CATHERINE THOMASSON IRA HELFAND Leeds, Mass., May 3, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writers are, respectively, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility and co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which received the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are correct that there needs to be a rational balance between the risks of technology and the ultimate benefit, which in the case of nuclear power is supplying electricity while reducing the effect of climate&nbsp;change. The case for nuclear, as you say, lies in the drawbacks of the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no magic energy source despite how green the alternatives are. Where power is needed, there is only insufficient and intermittent wind and sun, and a real challenge to compete economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear does need prudence, which has been well demonstrated in the United States, with reactors meeting exceptional safety standards. Independent, strict regulation works to make nuclear safe. It will allow nuclear power to make its contribution to controlling both polluting emissions and climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MICHAEL CORRADINI Madison, Wis., May 3, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a professor of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do an excellent job of summing up the case for nuclear power. One critical point, however, is missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reason that ''competition from cheap natural gas'' is a factor in the shutdown of nuclear plants is that the price of natural gas does not include externalities: the costs of the damage it causes to the environment by contributing to climate&nbsp;change. These are costs that society will have to bear in the future and that will only grow with time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while natural gas causes less climate damage than coal, it is nevertheless unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless we tax carbon emissions, either directly or through a cap-and-trade system, the economic incentives for making the right choices will remain distorted. That is something we cannot afford.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You belittle ''unfounded fears of using nuclear power.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To avoid nuclear power in the future is not an ''unfounded fear'' but a considered judgment based on nuclear disasters in three countries. Those demonstrate that we cannot trust the engineers and managers with the responsibility required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only sensible way forward is to adhere to greater prudence than you advocate: Require that all new and replacement energy come solely from renewable sources.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a time, the press lord William Randolph Hearst did everything in his vast powers to keep the film ''Citizen Kane'' from finding an audience. He intimidated theater owners, refused to let ads run in his newspapers, and even pressured studio sycophants to destroy the negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, the titan of San Simeon had his way: the film faded from view after a splashy initial release. But over the years, ''Citizen Kane'' came to be recognized for the masterpiece it is, and now regularly tops lists as the greatest film ever made.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modern equivalent of Hearst is the Koch Brothers, David and Charles -- known without affection as the Kochtopus. On certain days, depending on the stock market, their combined worth is more than any single American's, somewhere around $80 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have used a big part of this fortune to attack the indisputable science on climate&nbsp;change, to buy junk scholars, to promote harmful legislation at the state level, to go after clean, renewable energy like solar, and to try to kill the greatest expansion of health care in decades. Money can't buy love, but it certainly can cause a lot of havoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, while these billionaire industrialists may win in the short term -- the Republican Party, their toady, is likely to pick up seats in the House and may take control of the Senate as well -- in the larger fight against progress and modernity the Kochs have already lost. Clean energy is here to stay, and no sane political party would try to take away the health care of eight million fellow Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check that -- they'll try in both instances. According to one study, the Kochs have already spent $61 million on various front groups dedicated to the flat-earth proposition that the globe is not warming. But so far, the only return on that investment is a cohort of people flopping around in the waters of stupidity. About 44 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of Tea Party-leaning voters believe there is no solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer, according to the Pew Research Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, this is not 70 percent who think Donald Duck is really a platypus, though in a way it is. This is 70 percent who have been convinced that the actual hard numbers, that 9 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in this century, are a hoax. It's like saying, No, it was not 75 degrees in Atlanta yesterday -- that's just your view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this shows is that you can buy a lie, but you can't make that lie the truth. Over the last nine months, three exhaustive studies have shown that climate&nbsp;change is happening now, and will continue to unfold in real time, with record droughts in the American West, rising seas along the Atlantic coast, and global megastorms so catastrophic they will divert CNN from the missing plane. The climate experts in these studies are the gold standard -- from places like the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society. They are not political hacks looking to spin something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the real Sisyphean struggle for the Kochs is against science itself. With the fight against solar -- and other alternatives to the carbon-based source of the brothers' wealth -- the Kochs are up against market forces and the inevitability of an idea whose time has come. Across the nation, homeowners with solar have taken advantage of incentives that allow them to sell power they don't need back to the grid. They get the citizen satisfaction of doing their own small part to reduce emissions, but they also get to tell a big corporate or government entity to stuff it. Once you've shown people they can be their own electrical utility, you've unleashed something that will be very hard to take away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kochs, whose industries are among the nation's biggest corporate polluters, are currently funding stealth campaigns to roll back incentives for clean energy. What they're running up against are American do-it-yourselfers. The future of solar is now, with every homeowner tinkering on a roof, every company looking for tomorrow technology, every market improvement that brings the cost down and effectiveness up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their fight against health care, the Kochs are bumping into another wall of inconvenient truths. Not only has Obamacare exceeded expectations for sign-ups in the first year, but it's projected now to cover more people over 10 years -- 25 million -- and cost $104 billion less than previously forecast, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by the Annals of Internal Medicine found, in looking at the Massachusetts model for Obamacare, that expanding health insurance appeared to save many lives. Duh. But extrapolated from this report for the nation as a whole, you can make a case that the Affordable Care Act will prevent 24,000 deaths a year. Put another way, about 6,000 people a year will die in red states that refuse to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. There are your death panels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kochs also had funding ties to a campaign to persuade young people not to sign up for health care, hoping to sabotage it with beer parties and scare ads of a creepy Uncle Sam looking at a woman in an examining room. No surprise, the kids saw through it. More than enough millennials got coverage -- so many, that premiums may fall in the coming sign-up period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next year, the Kochs will have a Congress loaded with crackpots ready to serve their agenda. There will be show hearings, bills will be introduced, meaningless votes will be taken. In the end, health care and clean energy will march on. The Kochs, to close with another film reference, will be like Harold Lloyd in one of the great scenes from the silent movie era -- hanging from the hands of a giant clock. It may cost them half a billion dollars to learn that they can't stop time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama will announce on Friday a handful of executive actions and private and nonprofit groups' investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiatives will not amount to much in terms of energy policy or their impact on global warming. But they are part of a broader campaign to build public support for an Environmental Protection Agency rule that the White House will unveil in June. The rule, which has already run into objections, will limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and is expected to create a major new market for zero-carbon energy from sources like wind and solar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama will make his announcement in a speech at a Walmart in Mountain View, Calif., where he will talk up the benefits of solar power and energy efficiency. The speech will come at the end of a presidential fund-raising trip to Silicon Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president chose Walmart to make a point: The corporation gets about 25 percent of its electricity from renewable power sources such as solar and wind. In the United States over all, only about 5 percent of power comes from renewable sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sweeping National Climate Assessment report that was released this week lays out the impact of climate&nbsp;change across the United States, like increased flooding in Miami and devastating drought in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no chance that a major climate&nbsp;change bill will be passed by the deadlocked Congress. But Mr. Obama continues to announce small-scale actions. On Friday, they will include new energy conservation standards for devices like conveyor belts and escalators and one for walk-in coolers and a program to replace outdoor public lighting with energy-efficient alternatives in five cities. He will also set a goal to save $2 billion in three years by increasing energy efficiency in federal buildings, and he will promote an Energy Department program to provide solar industry training at community colleges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House estimates that together, the executive actions will spur private companies to invest an additional $2 billion in energy efficiency, and will cut carbon pollution by more than 380 million metric tons -- the equivalent of taking 80 million cars off the road for one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House will also announce that several housing developments will voluntarily increase their use of solar power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has for the first time called on insurers to incorporate climate&nbsp;change into their models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to action comes a day after a landmark US report, named the National Climate Assessment, which has warned that climate&nbsp;change is wreaking havoc across the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lloyd's says damage and weather-related losses around the world have increased from an annual average of $50bn in the 1980s to close to $200bn over the last 10 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 326-year-old insurance market believes the time has come for a formal call on the industry to take into account various climate&nbsp;change scenarios to avoid unpredictable losses to businesses. What the industry describes as extreme weather events have increased in number and severity as the global climate system has altered, causing more and bigger hurricanes, typhoons and heatwaves around the world. In the UK the main climate-change related risk is flooding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typhoon Haiyan, which last November swept across south-east Asia, especially affecting the Philippines, was one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year 2011 was the most expensive on record for natural disasters, with insured losses costing the industry more than $126bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superstorm Sandy caused $35bn of insured losses two years ago, making it the second costliest hurricane in US history after hurricane Katrina in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report by Lloyd's, which consulted the world's largest catastrophe modelling firms, says a 20cm rise in the sea level at the southern tip of Manhattan Island increased Superstorm Sandy's surge losses by 30% (up to $8bn) in New York alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 840-page National Climate Assessment was described by John Holdren, the White House science adviser, as the &quot;loudest and clearest alarm bell to date signalling the need to take urgent action to combat the threats to Americans from climate&nbsp;change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trevor Maynard, head of exposure management and reinsurance at Lloyd's, said: &quot;Climate&nbsp;change is very much here to stay. Hurricanes are getting stronger worldwide, and especially over the north Atlantic . . . At the moment we are heading for a rise of four degrees (in temperatures) by the end of the century.&quot; He said that increased threats ranged from property damage to political risk - such as the implications for food security - and the economic impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could mean the insurance industry would need to hold more capital to protect against increased risk, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maynard said that while insurers typically arrange insurance cover for a stretch of one year, planners and building constructors would need to look ahead to the next 40 to 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There is every indication that (storms) will get more extreme as the temperature rises.&quot; He noted that the report by Sir Nicholas Stern on the economics of climate&nbsp;change concluded that it was cheaper &quot;to avoid it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lloyd's made a &pound;516m loss in 2011 after paying out the largest catastrophe claims on record - caused by earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, storms in the US, and floods in Thailand and Australia. The area flooded in Thailand was the size of Birmingham and it remained under water for a couple of months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since this year Lloyd's has been run by Inga Beale, who became chief executive of the company in January. The organisation, which started in a coffee house in 1688 where merchants insured ships has evolved into a group of about 80 competing insurance syndicates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than $1tn (&pound;600bn) is being gambled on high-cost oil projects that will never see a return if the world's governments fulfil their pledge to tackle climate&nbsp;change, says a new report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI) research found that $1.1tn of capital expenditure is expected in the next decade in expensive oil sands, deepwater and Arctic projects, but that this investment will be lost if policymakers agree to slash carbon emissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This analysis shows that many oil companies are betting on a high demand and price scenario,&quot; said James Leaton, research director at CTI and a former PwC consultant. &quot;Investors need to (challenge oil company strategies) to ensure capital is not being wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new work connects the economics of oil production with the limit on carbon emissions needed to avoid dangerous climate&nbsp;change. It found that only the oil expected to cost less than $75 a barrel to produce - much of which is from conventional onshore wells - can be burned within the planet's carbon budget. The analysts found even when focusing only on the high-cost end - more than $95 a barrel - $1.1tn was at risk from 2014-2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region with the highest risk of wasted capital in the report was Alberta. Canada's vast oil sands province is expected to see $400bn of investment by 2025. The companies with the biggest exposure to risk there are Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, Suncor and Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Brazil were also seen as high risk, with ExxonMobil and Petrobras set to invest $100bn each. Ultra-deepwater projects, which drill in ocean depths greater than 1,500m, expose Total and BP to the risk of capital being wasted, the report concludes. In the Arctic, Statoil was most exposed, with $22bn capital expenditure projected by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another analysis in the report also found that high-cost (more than $80/barrel), high-carbon projects comprised between a fifth and a quarter of the total capital expenditure expected by the big international oil companies in the next 10 years, with Total at 28% and BP at 18%. But at least a dozen multibillion-dollar independent oil companies had 85-100% of their capital expenditure targeted at high-cost projects. &quot;They are betting the farm on a high oil price,&quot; said Leaton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded: &quot;Gambling on a $95-per-barrel oil price on behalf of shareholders is risky, given that oil prices have dropped to $40 per barrel twice in the last decade. Demand for oil could be impacted by a range of future issues, such as the increasing constraints on emissions (through climate policies), efficiency gains, improvements in technology, and slowdown in the Chinese economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Spedding, a former HSBC oil and gas sector analyst, said: &quot;Many investors are concerned about the growing amount of capital that the oil companies have thrown at low-return, carbon-heavy projects. The strategies need to be challenged. If this means lower capital investment and higher dividends or buybacks, so much the better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors managing trillions of dollars have already begun pressing fossil-fuel companies to set out their strategies to manage the risk that oil, gas and coal burning may be restricted in the future. But recently ExxonMobil said it thought it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that the world would cut carbon emissions enough in order to tackle dangerous climate&nbsp;change. &quot;ExxonMobil's attitude that the risk of climate action is near zero seems an irresponsible attitude to risk management to me,&quot; said Anthony Hobley, chief executive of CTI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new CTI report was welcomed by Christiana Figueres, the UN's top climate diplomat tasked with delivering a global agreement to cut carbon emissions by 2015. &quot;It enhances the ability of investors to hedge against risks and capture rewards in a carbon-constrained world,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing overwhelming evidence of climate change, some deniers argue global warming could be a business opportunity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over a decade ago, US Senator James Inhofe helped derail early bipartisan efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions. His now-infamous 12,000-word, science-distorting speech concluded with a warning that international efforts to reign in climate-destabilizing emissions were not about saving the planet, or even humanity's place on it, but &quot;handicapping the American economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people? It sure sounds like it,&quot; the former chairman of the Senate committee on environment and public Works concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the &quot;hoax&quot; message helped sink 2003's Climate Stewardship Act, it has since fallen on hard times. The scientific understanding of human-induced climate&nbsp;change has tightened to a certainty on par with tobacco's link to cancer, and increasing numbers of Americans have begun to testify that they have personally been impacted by climate&nbsp;change and related extreme weather events.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the[#xfffd]US Global Change Research Program released a summation of climate impacts already being experienced across the US. The 800-page document, which White House adviser John Podesta called &quot;actionable[#xfffd]science&quot;, details the increasing incidence of extreme weather events, such as record-setting heatwaves, droughts and downpours, among the impacts already being experienced because of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's findings, and its projections of future events, make it harder for the forces rallied against collaborative international climate action to deny that climate&nbsp;change is occurring. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">From denying to downplaying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter economist Richard Tol. In March, Tol, a professor at the University of Sussex, resigned his position as a contributing lead author to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change's most recent report on the environmental, economic and social vulnerabilities associated with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming that the report's Summary for Policy Makers was &quot;alarmist&quot; and didn't reflect the report as a whole, Tol, an advisor to the conservative British thinktank Global Warming Policy Foundation, and others have inspired a spate of stories suggesting an &quot;upside&quot; to the climate crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take this piece from Spectator columnist Matt Ridley: &quot;We have a climate&nbsp;change consensus - and it's good news everyone&quot;. And from conservative think tank The Heartland Institute: &quot;Benefits of Global Warming Greatly Exceed Costs, New Study Says&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is pretty damn obvious that there are positive impacts of climate&nbsp;change, even though we are not always allowed to talk about them,&quot; Tol told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though his own research is being actively challenged as downplaying the economic costs climate&nbsp;change poses to the world, Tol's suggestion that a little warming may actually be good for us, as recently relayed by Bloomberg Businessweek, has since been picked up and amplified by numerous media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on Tol's past work, Ridley has argued that &quot;climate&nbsp;change has done more good than harm so far,&quot; and will probably do so &quot;for most of this century&quot;. And, on Fox News, conservative American columnist Cal Thomas quoted Tol, suggesting that &quot;the idea that climate&nbsp;change poses an existential threat to humankind is laughable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Dusting off an old argument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has the denial camp has found its new meme? One that admits the warming is happening but insists - contrary to the overwhelming evidence - that it's beneficial?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly, says Harvard University professor and science historian Naomi Oreskes, co-author of Merchants of Doubt. &quot;One thing these folks have done for a long time is have a kind of repertoire of arguments, and, depending on circumstances, they trot out different ones,&quot; she said. &quot;This is not new. This is recycled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;good news&quot; of global warming has been promoted at least since 1992, the year President George HW Bush attended the UN-sponsored Earth Summit in Brazil and committed the nation for the first time to voluntary greenhouse gas reductions. Already engaged in a public-relations war to dispel growing public concern about global warming, the coal industry lobby funded a 30-minute video promoting the purported benefits of carbon dioxide pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, soil scientist Sherwood Idso stated that a doubling of carbon dioxide would produce a &quot;tremendous greening of planet earth&quot;. An accompanying graphic showed a map of Africa transformed from brown to green. The message later found its way into Inhofe's 2003 speech when he claimed that agricultural productivity would be &quot;30% higher in a CO2-enhanced world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industrially elevated atmospheric CO2 has since increased to about 400 parts per million, nearly90 ppm over 1950 levels. While this has resulted in some agricultural gains in recent decades, the overall impact of climate&nbsp;change on crop production has been negative thanks to rises in surface air temperatures, ground-level ozone and extreme weather, according to the most recent IPCC report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Idso, who has enjoyed support from fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks for years, persists. He makes virtually the same argument in Climate&nbsp;Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts, a collaborative report published last month for the libertarian Heartland Institute's Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change. Dismissing the potential of human industry to significantly affect the global climate, the report praises the &quot;great greening of the earth&quot; that has resulted from rising atmospheric CO2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Zombie arguments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental sociologist Riley E Dunlap calls such recycled contrarian messages &quot;zombie arguments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based in Inhofe's backyard at Oklahoma State University, Dunlap is chair of the American Sociological Association's Task Force on Sociology and Global Climate&nbsp;Change. As part of his research, he tracks the various memes of climate&nbsp;change deniers in popular media and within the publications of think tanks like Heartland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While some contrarian scientists have changed their arguments over time so they are less out of step with the preponderance of scientific evidence, on skeptic blogs and among politicians one can constantly find these zombie arguments,&quot; Dunlap said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A paper he co-authored in 2000 recorded 159 &quot;counter-arguments&quot; published by conservative US thinktanks between 1990 to 1997 challenging the dominant scientific evidence of warming. Likewise, he found 139 examples of arguments during the same period insisting that policy responses intended to slow or reverse global warming would &quot;do more harm than good&quot;. He finally found 30 examples of the argument being made that global warming would be beneficial in some way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A follow-up study in 2012 tracking similar arguments being made by conservative columnists replaced the beneficial language with the assertion that global warming is &quot;not bad&quot;. It found all examples still being widely employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the so-called benefits honed in on by the business community seem to be more in line with the consensus science reflected in the IPCC reports. Raytheon, for example, is positioning itself to reap benefits from both a growing market for renewable energy and forecasting technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense contractor also anticipates that climate&nbsp;change will lead to a rising demand for weapon systems. A company report, Mother Jones reported, claimed that &quot;climate&nbsp;change may cause humanitarian disasters, contribute to political violence and undermine weak governments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon's 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review echoes this conclusion, noting that climate&nbsp;change &quot;will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions - conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, climate denial and threat minimization aside, when it comes to security, the Pentagon and its military contractors are planning for climate&nbsp;change. And their predictions of widespread, disruptive effects seem to be in close agreement with the IPCC's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital investment will never see a return if world's governments fulfil climate change pledge, new report warns</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over $1tn is being gambled on high-cost oil projects that will never see a return if the world's governments fulfil their pledge to tackle climate&nbsp;change, according to a new report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI) research found that $1.1tn of capital expenditure is expected in the next decade in expensive oil sands, deepwater and Arctic projects but that this investment will be lost if policymakers agree to slash carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This risk analysis shows that many oil companies are betting on a high demand and price scenario,&quot; said James Leaton, research director at CTI and a former PwC consultant. &quot;Investors need to [challenge oil company strategies] to ensure capital is not being wasted.&quot; Previous CTI research has shown that about two-thirds of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned if global warming is to be limited to 2C, as agreed by the world's nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new work connects the economics of oil production with the limit on carbon emissions needed to avoid dangerous climate&nbsp;change. It found that only the oil expected to cost less than $75 a barrel to produce, much of which is from conventional onshore wells, can be burned within the planet's 'carbon budget'. The analysts found even when focusing only on the high-cost end - oil costing more than $95 a barrel - $1.1tn was at risk from 2014-2025. Looking further ahead, to 2050, CTI estimated $21tn worth of high-cost oil projects could be wasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region with the highest risk of wasted capital in the report was Alberta. Canada's vast oil sands province is expected to see $400bn of investment by 2025. The companies with the biggest exposure to risk there are Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Suncor and Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico and off Brazil were also seen as high risk, with ExxonMobil and Petrobras set to invest $100bn each. Ultra-deepwater projects, which drill in ocean depths greater than 1500m, expose Total and BP to the risk of capital being wasted, the report concludes. In the Arctic, Statoil were most exposed, with $22bn capital expenditure projected by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also found that high cost (more than$80/barrel), high carbon projects comprised between a fifth and a quarter of the total capital expenditure expected by the major international oil companies in the next 10 years, with Total at 28% and BP at 18%. But at least a dozen, multi-billion-dollar independent oil companies had at 85-100% of their capex targeted at high cost projects. &quot;They are betting the farm on a high oil price,&quot; said Leaton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded: &quot;Gambling on a $95 per barrel oil price on behalf of shareholders is risky given that oil prices have dropped to $40 per barrel twice in the last decade. Demand for oil could be impacted by a range of future issues, such as the increasing constraints on emissions [through climate policies], efficiency gains, improvements in technology, and slowdown in the Chinese economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Spedding, a former-HSBC oil and gas sector analyst, said: &quot;Many investors are concerned about the growing amount of capital that the oil companies have thrown at low return, carbon heavy projects. The strategies need to be challenged. If this means lower capital investment and higher dividends or buybacks, so much the better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig MacKenzie, investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management, said that unlike Carbon Tracker's previous work on unburnable carbon, the new report dealt with how much demand there may be for oil. &quot;Oil analysts think about demand all the time, so it feeds into the very lively debate about oil prices. This kind of debate now has real traction with investors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacKenzie added: &quot;If you look at the return on capital from the majors over the last five years it has been very dissappointing: it has fallen by a third and is now barely covering costs. They need to avoid big splurges of capital on projects that may not pay off. But there has been a sea change in the last year with companies focussing more on shareholder value and not on the volume of oil produced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors managing trillions of dollars have already begun pressing fossil fuel companies to set out their strategies to manage the risk that oil, gas and coal burning may be restricted in the future. But recently ExxonMobil said it thought it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that the world would cut carbon emissions enough in order to tackle dangerous climate&nbsp;change. &quot;ExxonMobil's attitude that the risk of climate action is near zero seems an irresponsible attitude to risk management to me,&quot; said Anthony Hobley, CEO of CTI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new CTI report was welcomed by Christiana Figueres, the UN's top climate diplomat tasked with delivering a global agreement to cut carbon emissions by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It enhances the ability of investors to hedge against risks and capture rewards in a carbon-constrained world,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figueres also backed the growing campaign to pressure universities, municipalities and other large fund managers to sell off their shares in fossil fuel companies. &quot;Divestment may be a question of morality, but it is prudent too,&quot; she wrote in the Guardian on Wednesday. In April, Nobel peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for an anti-apartheid-style boycott and disinvestment campaign against the fossil fuel industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is finally waking up to the reality and the magnitude of the climate crisis. Climate-related disasters will continue to affect our communities as warming increases, and people will continue to wake up. It's not going to just go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, soon I hope, a revenue-neutral carbon tax will become politically possible. Revenue would be returned to taxpayers, rewarding those who emit less carbon and stimulating change throughout our economy and infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too late to stop global warming, but how bad it gets is still up to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's leave something for our children. Let's do what we need to do. To those who keep bringing up jobs: If we innovate a world beyond coal, oil and natural gas, our economy will benefit enormously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we continue chasing the nightmare of fossil fuels, we will certainly continue to decline. A revenue-neutral carbon tax is the best way to jump-start innovation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a postdoctoral scholar in climate science at the California Institute of Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months the scientific community has acknowledged that the worst-case scenarios are increasingly likely, and that past projections were far too conservative. Yes, we will likely see three feet of sea-level rise by the end of this century. Yes, even six feet cannot be ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason that people are so ambivalent about climate&nbsp;change is that previous warnings were far too tentative, making the problem seem both small and remote. In fact, the problem is dire and immediate. I hope that people will start to listen now that climate&nbsp;change is literally right in front of our eyes, and the melting of the ice in Greenland and Antarctica is already occurring much faster than initially projected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERIN O'CONNELL Chicago, May 7, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people accept that climate&nbsp;change is occurring and that the consequences over the next 100 years will be devastating for agriculture, water supplies and for coastal cities. Whether we can prevent climate&nbsp;change is more debatable. But we should be taking steps now to mitigate future anticipated damage. Why aren't we?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California is prone to periodic droughts, deluges and infrastructure-destroying earthquakes. Yet we have delayed projects like the Bay Delta Conservation Plan that would ensure a steady supply of water from the north to the dry south. Why? Because of the same mentality that prevents us from becoming more proactive in mitigating climate&nbsp;change: short-term cost concerns and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are cursed with the intelligence to see the future, but not the emotional maturity to do much about it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our nation and planet need leaders who are informed about climate&nbsp;change if we are to stand a chance of addressing the problem. Mr. Huntsman's anecdote about the North Carolina congressional debate in which all the Republican candidates denied the fact of climate&nbsp;change illustrates our failure to ask the right questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone needs to answer: ''On what climate studies or data is your belief based?'' This will help voters judge whether this is an informed opinion or simply a surrender to ignorance. I call on the press to help us better vet those who wish to lead us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the block at an electronics store it is even worse. Jankel Aleman, a salesman, keeps plastic bags and rubber bands handy to wrap around his feet when he trudges from his car to the store through ever-rising waters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new scientific report on global warming released this week, the National Climate Assessment, named Miami as one of the cities most vulnerable to severe damage as a result of rising sea levels. Alton Road, a commercial thoroughfare in the heart of stylish South Beach, is getting early ripples of sea level rise caused by global warming -- even as Florida's politicians, including two possible contenders for the presidency in 2016, are starkly at odds over what to do about it and whether the problem is even real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The theme of the report is that climate&nbsp;change is not a future thing, it's a 'happening-now' thing,'' said Leonard Berry, a contributing author of the new report and director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University. ''Alton Road is one of the now things.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea levels have risen eight inches since 1870, according to the new report, which projects a further rise of one to four feet by the end of the century. Waters around southeast Florida could surge up to two feet by 2060, according to a report by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact. A study by the Florida Department of Transportation concluded that over the next 35 years, rising sea levels will increasingly flood and damage smaller local roads in the Miami area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national climate report found that although rapidly melting Arctic ice is threatening the entire American coastline, Miami is exceptionally vulnerable because of its unique geology. The city is built on top of porous limestone, which is already allowing the rising seas to soak into the city's foundation, bubble up through pipes and drains, encroach on fresh water supplies and saturate infrastructure. County governments estimate that the damages could rise to billions or even trillions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In and around Miami, local officials are grappling head on with the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Sea level rise is our reality in Miami Beach,'' said the city's mayor, Philip Levine. ''We are past the point of debating the existence of climate&nbsp;change and are now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.'' In the face of encroaching saltwater and sunny-day flooding like that on Alton Road, Mr. Levine has supported a $400 million spending project to make the city's drainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. Scientists say that the scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, climate experts say, national policies to tax or regulate carbon pollution are required by the world's top emitters, chiefly the United States and China. Such efforts have to date met a wave of political opposition in Congress -- bills aimed at putting a price on carbon pollution have repeatedly failed. President Obama plans to use his executive authority to issue a regulation that would cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, but Republicans, who call the rule a ''War on Coal,'' want to overturn it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, supports carbon-cutting efforts, even as he acknowledges that they will come with some economic cost. In April, he convened a packed hearing at the Miami Beach City Hall on the encroaching waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''With sea level rise, you've got to get to core of the problem,'' Mr. Nelson said at the hearing. ''You have to lessen the amount of CO2. It's politically treacherous and costly. But at the end of the day, something like that is going to have to get passed. Otherwise the planet is going to continue to heat up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But three prominent Florida Republicans -- Senator Marco Rubio, former Gov. Jeb Bush and the current governor, Rick Scott -- declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the subject. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush are viewed as potential presidential candidates. Political analysts say the reluctance of the three men to speak publicly on the issue reflects an increasingly difficult political reality for Republicans grappling with the issue of climate&nbsp;change, particularly for the party's lawmakers from Florida. In acknowledging the problem, politicians must endorse a solution, but the only major policy solutions to climate&nbsp;change -- taxing or regulating the oil, gas and coal industries -- are anathema to the base of the Republican Party. Thus, many Republicans, especially in Florida, appear to be dealing with the issue by keeping silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Jeb likes to take positions on hot-button issues, the same with Rubio,'' said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. ''On immigration they are further mainstream on that than the rest of the G.O.P. But on this, Republicans are dead set against taking action on climate&nbsp;change on the national level. If you have political aspirations, this is not something you should talk about if you want to win a Republican primary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, Mr. Rubio has signaled his skepticism about the established science that fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate&nbsp;change. When asked in a 2013 Buzzfeed webcast interview if climate&nbsp;change posed a threat to Florida, Mr. Rubio responded: ''The climate is always changing. The question is, is manmade activity what's contributing most to it?'' He added that ''I've seen reasonable debate on that principle'' and ''if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy it would have a devastating impact.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 2008, while serving in the Florida State Legislature, Mr. Rubio supported a bill directing the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As governor from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Bush pushed several environmental initiatives, particularly efforts to protect Everglades National Park, which scientists say is highly vulnerable to encroaching seawaters. Political scientists say that Mr. Rubio's shift and Mr. Bush's current silence on the issue appear to reflect the position of lawmakers who are mulling transitions from the state to the national stage and the realities of satisfying their party's base in the 2016 primaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the disinformation sowed by politicians content with the status quo, the main reason neither Congress nor much of the American public cares about global warming is that, as problems go, it seems remote. Anyone who reads the latest National Climate Assessment, released on Tuesday, cannot possibly think that way any longer. The report is exhaustive and totally alarming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, produced by scientists from academia, government and the private sector, is the definitive statement of the present and future effects of climate&nbsp;change on the United States. Crippling droughts will become more frequent in drier regions; torrential rains and storm surges will increase in wet regions; sea levels will rise and coral reefs in Hawaii and Florida will die. Readers can pick their own regional catastrophes, but here are three:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SOUTHWEST WILL FRY California's relentless drought has been making headlines for years. But while there may be some cyclical relief, global warming will make things worse in the long run, increasing wildfires throughout the Southwest and in California, stunting crops in one of America's great breadbaskets and greatly increasing the region's historical competition for water -- its most precious natural resource.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EAST WILL SOAK Hurricane Sandy provided a costly glimpse into a future that will bring more destructive storms, not because a warming climate will cause more hurricanes (that link is still a matter of debate) but because sea levels will rise, leading to bigger storm surges and greater risks for Americans who live in coastal areas. There will also be many more sudden and intense rains in parts of the South and in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the sea level, the study went beyond the recent predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, which forecast a rise of 3 feet unless aggressive measures were taken. The new American report says that a rise of 6 feet cannot be ruled out. Much of South Florida sits at 4 feet above high tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALASKA WILL KEEP MELTING An academic study 12 years ago noted an astonishing 5.4 degree increase in the annual mean temperatures in Alaska, causing melting permafrost and dying forests. More of the same lies ahead: shrinking glaciers and summer sea ice and more global warming as the carbon trapped in the permafrost is released into the atmosphere as methane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broad contours of the report are not news to President Obama, who said in his State of the Union address that ''the debate is settled. Climate&nbsp;change is a fact.'' And he promised, in his climate action plan, to impose through executive action new limits on carbon dioxide emissions that Congress has failed to deliver legislatively. And, so far, he has done so, announcing rules governing emissions from new power plants and stricter fuel-efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks to go with the historic fuel-efficiency standards for cars finalized in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sterner tests lie ahead. For starters, Mr. Obama must devise new rules governing natural gas drilling, lest leaks of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- erase natural gas's carbon advantage over coal. More important, he must follow through with the strongest possible new rules on existing power plants, which account for about 40 percent of the country's carbon dioxide emissions. These rules, which are now being written and are due to be announced in early June, will be hugely controversial and almost certainly litigated, since regulating greenhouse gases from stationary sources is largely uncharted territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate-change deniers in Congress and industry allies like Senator Mitch McConnell, who hails from a coal-producing state, will be ferocious, employing the usual disruptive legislative and legal stratagems. The surest antidotes are continued presidential resolve, backed by voters sensitized to climate warming's dangers. The new report should help on both fronts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change has moved from the corners of the Earth into America's backyard, the country's leading scientists warned yesterday, releasing a landmark report they hope will spur action on climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 840-page National Climate Assessment is seen as the definitive account of the effects of climate&nbsp;change on America, and of the country's efforts to deal with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings were immediately embraced by the White House as &quot;actionable science&quot; which would guide Barack Obama as he moves to cut carbon emissions from power plants next month and for the remaining two years of his presidency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this National Climate Assessment is the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date signalling the need to take urgent action to combat the threats to Americans from climate&nbsp;change,&quot; John Holdren, the White House science adviser, said in a conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists who worked on the report said its main message was that climate&nbsp;change was disrupting the lives of Americans - now and in real time - and was doing so much more strongly than scientists had expected. Climate&nbsp;change was registering in the form of extreme weather, sea-level rise and the thawing of Arctic sea ice, a shift in growing seasons, and other indicators, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this report shows is that climate&nbsp;change is happening now in our own backyards,&quot; Thomas Karl, the director of the climatic centre at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the Guardian. &quot;There are a number of changes that have become faster, more apparent and stronger than we first anticipated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report for the first time looks at what America is doing to cut the emissions that cause climate&nbsp;change, and to protect people from its consequences in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said all Americans were experiencing and would continue to experience the effects of climate&nbsp;change .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,&quot; the report said. &quot;Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some parts of the country will be harder hit than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea-level rise, which could reach 4ft by the end of the century, was already causing dangerous flooding in low-lying areas such as Miami, Norfolk, Virginia, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the report said. Florida alone could face a $130bn bill for flooding damage by 2100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought and high temperatures were already baking California and Arizona and prolonging the fire season in other parts of the south-west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other areas of the country - especially the north-east and mid-west - were experiencing climate&nbsp;change in sudden and torrential downpours, which lead to heavy flooding. The north-east had seen a 70% rise in heavy rainfall events in the last 60 years, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also warned of a growing risk of contaminated water supplies because of sea-level rise and flooding, and poor air quality as hotter temperatures cook the smog, and soot from wildfires drifts across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those with allergies are facing longer pollen and ragweed seasons - by as much as 24 days in North Dakota and Minnesota, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think maybe this report will be the turning point when people finally realise that this is about them,&quot; Susan Hassol, the chief science writer on the report, told the Guardian. &quot;It's about them and their lives . . . Earlier, they had seen it as a distant threat - distant in time, distance in space, this is about the poles, this is about certain island nations. They have not seen it as a potential threat in their own backyard.&quot; The White House moved to try to capitalise on that new sense of immediacy, organising a series of events yesterday and this week to showcase the findings of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental groups and Democratic members of Congress also rallied to support the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Podesta, the White House counsellor, said Obama would rely on the report's findings as he moves ahead with the most ambitious phase of his climate&nbsp;change plan in June - a proposal to cut emissions from the current generation of power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power plants were responsible for nearly 40% of US carbon dioxide emissions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president discussed those plans and climate&nbsp;change with television meteorologists in the Rose Garden later yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the White House acknowledged Obama would continue to face strong pushback from Republicans and industry. Podesta said the most Obama could expect from Congress in the way of climate action was a modest energy efficiency bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a leading coal industry lobby group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, dismissed the report as &quot;unsubstantiated scare tactics and hyperbole&quot; and lashed out at Obama for moving ahead on power plant regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander White: Instead of cutting public funding for climate initiatives, Tony Abbott and the Australian government could save $2.4 billion next year by scrapping the diesel fuel subsidy. So why won't he?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Australia&nbsp;may sell assets and cut welfare spending to rein in a debt burden that is already the second-smallest among developed nations&quot; reported Bloomberg breathlessly early in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the madness of the deeply unpopular conservative Australian government, which will lay down its budget for the coming 12 months next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to justify its right-wing agenda, the Abbott government ordered a National Commission of Audit. The Commission's report was released a week ago, and was described as a &quot;document that appears to hates Australia&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst its many recommendations was one to axe climate programs at the national science organisation, the CSIRO, and the Bureau of Meteorology. It also recommends halving the budget for the National Landcare Program, abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Authority, and merge specialist and independent National Water Commission and Murray Darling Basin Authority into other government departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian government already has a terrible reputation with climate&nbsp;change information and science in general. There is no dedicated Minister for Science, and one of the first acts of the Abbott government was to shut down the Climate Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission of Audit report is transparently a tool for the Abbott government to be a stalking horse for their extreme agenda, and to provide cover for their first budget. Abbott and his advisors know that you make all your unpopular decisions and cuts early, so you can buy votes&nbsp;closer to the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Ironically and scandalously, the Commission, after recommending so many cuts to public programs, busted its own budget by over double, according to the West Australian newspaper, costing $2.5 million with just a $1 million budget.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the many broken election promises embodied in both the Commission of Audit report, and the various policies canvassed by Abbott and his treasurer Joe Hockey, is a desire to reduce the deficit. At its heart, the Abbott government wants to pursue an austerity agenda to wind back the social democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bloomberg noted, Australia has the second-smallest budget deficit in the developed world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A substantial part of this deficit has been utterly concocted by the government, according to the ABC's fact-checker. The treasurer has added $68 billion to the deficit, and has tried to lay the blame at the feet of the former Labor government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the many recommendations from the Commission of Audit and various policy thought-bubbles from the government, almost no suggestion has been given to reducing the vast amounts of subsidies and tax credits given to corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;particularly egregious subsidy is the diesel fuel subsidy, which will cost $2.4 billion next year. This equates to a hand-out by Australian tax-payers of around $182 each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national president of the mining union, the CFMEU, Tony Maher called out this squandering of public funds in&nbsp;an article for ABC's The Drum:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does it really make sense for taxpayers to be funding a rebate on diesel fuel for the mining industry at a cost of $2 billion a year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFMEU underlined this point in a senate submission to the Select Committee on Fuel and Energy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Taxation Office has stated that for the 2006-07 year, the mining industry was easily the heaviest user of the fuel tax credit schemes, claiming $1.47 billion of the $4.9 billion claimed. The next highest claim by an industry was transport and warehousing with $1.28 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter industry made 171,085 claims for the credits, while the mining industry made just 6,735. This vast difference demonstrates that mining industry claims are made by a relatively small number of very large companies, while the transport claims often come from small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the mining industry receives such extensive fuel tax credits while claiming to be internationally competitive and unsubsidised has attracted significant criticism from an environmental perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing level of significant subsidy weakens the substantial argument that the industry is otherwise able to make that is it one of Australia's great success stories. Industries that rely on subsidies or other forms of protection are not generally able to be portrayed as a success story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the mining industry is not a deserving case. There are no grounds in terms of equity, social justice or industry development to justify a significant subsidy to the mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government could avoid cutting important education, health, and disability support programs, by simply ending the ludicrous diesel fuel subsidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, cutting this subsidy has been ruled out by treasurer Joe Hockey, according to the ABC. The argument used to defend this subsidy is that it is used by farmers, but as the CFMEU notes, the biggest beneficiary is the mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian mining industry has form, and its power has been demonstrated over the past few years, and as Ben Phillips writes, it is really about an industry locked in a life-or-death struggle to keep profiteering.&nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;it is remarkable (but not surprising given this recent revelation) that Hockey was so quick to rule out scrapping the diesel subsidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, treasurer Joe Hockey declared that the so-called &quot;age of entitlement&quot;&nbsp;to be&nbsp;over:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say to you emphatically, everyone in Australia must do the heavy lifting. The age of entitlement is over, the age of personal responsibility has begun,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, he really is referring to everyday people, not corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just environmentalists calling for the end of the diesel subsidy. The International Monetary Fund, not a notable hotbed of socialistic revolutionaries, called in March for the ending of subsidies for fossil fuels. Globally, 2.5 percent of global GDP is spent on fuel subsidies, with wealthy households capturing around 43 percent of the benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I've written before, the conservative world-view&nbsp;supports fossil fuel subsidies because they see the wealth of companies like mining companies as inherently&nbsp;moral&nbsp;and because subsidies incentivise their hard work. Support for everyday people and disadvantaged people is immoral because in the minds of conservatives, it creates dependency and promotes laziness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week's budget will likely see the Abbott-led Australian government commit an unforgivable act of self-harm upon the Australian people in pursuit of their extreme, ideologically-motivated conservative agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Greg Jericho says, this budget will&nbsp;just be the first step to achieving a &quot;dopey regurgitation of libertarian masturbatory fantasy&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High CO2 levels significantly reduces essential nutrients in wheat, rice, maize and soyabeans, Nature paper reveals</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising carbon dioxide emissions are set to make the world's staple food crops less nutritious, according to new scientific research, worsening the serious ill health already suffered by billions of malnourished people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise consequence of fossil fuel burning is linked directly to the rise in CO2 levels which, unlike some of the predicted impacts of climate&nbsp;change, are undisputed. The field trials of wheat, rice, maize and soybeans showed that higher CO2 levels significantly reduced the levels of the essential nutrients iron and zinc, as well as cutting protein levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found rising levels of CO2 are affecting human nutrition by reducing levels of very important nutrients in very important food crops,&quot; said Prof Samuel Myers, an environmental health expert at Harvard University, Boston, and lead author of the study. &quot;From a health viewpoint, iron and zinc are hugely important.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myers said 2 billion people already suffer iron and zinc deficiencies around the world. This causes serious harm, in particular to developing babies and pregnant women, and currently causes the loss of 63m years of life annually. &quot;Fundamentally the concern is that there is already an enormous public health problem and rising CO2 in the atmosphere will exacerbate that problem further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While wheat, rice, maize and soybeans are relatively low in iron and zinc, in poorer societies where meat is rarely eaten they are a major source of the nutrients. About 2.4bn people currently get at least 60% of their zinc and iron from these staples and it is over 75% in Bangladesh, Iraq and Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is yet another example of the impact climate&nbsp;change is already having on people's ability to grow and access the nutritious food they need,&quot; said Hannah Stoddart, Oxfam's head of policy for food and climate. &quot;With 25 million more children under five at risk of malnutrition by 2050 because of climate&nbsp;change, action to cut emissions and support communities to adapt is crucial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research, published in the journal Nature, represents a major advance in the understanding of how rising CO2 levels affect food nutrition. The scientists compared nutrient levels in field crops grown in ambient CO2 levels, about 380-390 parts per milliion (ppm) at the time of the work, with those grown in the elevated CO2 levels expected by 2050. The latter level, 545-585ppm, is expected even if substantial curbs on emissions are put in place by the world's governments. In order to take account of variable growing conditions, the researchers analysed 41 different strains grown in seven locations on three different continents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wheat grown in high CO2 levels had 9% less zinc and 5% less iron, as well as 6% less protein, while rice had 3% less iron, 5% less iron and 8% less protein. Maize saw similar falls while soybeans lost similar levels of zinc and iron but, being a legume not a grass, did not see lower protein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precise biological mechanism that causes nutrient levels to fall is not well understood as yet. But Professor Brian Thomas, a plant develoment expert at the University of Warwick and not involved in the research said: &quot;The work is convincing and consistent with what we do know about the plant physiology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact on human health resulting from the drop in the level of protein is less clear than for the zinc and iron loss. Myers said the resulting increase in carbohydrate in the crops could increase the rate of metabolic syndrome, the diabetes, heart disease and stroke that currently afflicts many in developed countries due to high levels of obesity. But Myers said obesity is not necessary for the risk of metabolic syndrome to rise. &quot;It is something to do with the switch of foods itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myers said simply eating more staple foods to meet zinc and iron requirements was not realistic when food production already must double by 2050 to meet the demand of rising populations. Some of the varieties used in the research performed better than others, raising the prospect of breeding strains that are less vulnerable to rising CO2. But the researchers noted: &quot;Such breeding programmes will not be a panacea for many reasons including the affordability of improved seeds and the numerous criteria used by farmers in making planting decisions that include taste, tradition, marketability, growing requirements and yield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myers acknowledged that rising CO2 can improve crop yields on some circumstances, but said: &quot;There may be a little positive effect, but the people who work in this area would not want to hang their hat on that in the face of the many other negative effects of climate&nbsp;change, including heatwaves droughts and floods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April saw the first month for millions of years in which the CO2 level was greater than 400pm every day: before the industrial revolution started the large-scale burning of fossil fuels the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was 280ppm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myers told the Guardian: &quot;It is very hard to predict all the challenges to human health resulting from climate&nbsp;change. My guess is there will be many more surprises as we remake the environmental conditions on the planet. As a civilisation we are now living with 400 ppm for the first time: it's a new world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon M. Huntsman Jr., chairman of the Atlantic Council, was governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009 and the United States ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. He was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- ''TO waste, to destroy our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and developed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These words were spoken by one of the nation's most passionate conservationists: Republican President Teddy Roosevelt. I admire him for his pragmatism and individualism -- foundational traits of the Republican Party. We must summon these qualities and apply them immediately and stoutly to the issue of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading up to the elections of 2008, Republican leaders at all levels were working innovatively across party and ideological divides to address environmental issues, including climate&nbsp;change. They included names like Huckabee, Pawlenty, Schwarzenegger and McCain. I was re-elected with almost 80 percent of the vote in bright red Utah as an environmentally forward-leaning Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been a shift among Republicans on climate&nbsp;change. Last fall, 50 percent said there was solid evidence of rising temperatures on earth, according to the Pew Research Center. But that is down from 2006, when 59 percent of Republicans held that view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps some of this shift has to do with the economic collapse and a resulting change in concerns and priorities. At the same time, many party leaders may have felt the need to run for cover because of growing pressure from the Tea Party. (Among Tea Party Republicans, 41 percent told Pew last fall that global warming was not happening; another 28 percent said not enough was known.) Others in the party have simply moved away from the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt. What's been lost is any Republican creative thinking on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So obtuse has become the party's dialogue on climate&nbsp;change that it's now been reduced to believing or not believing, as if it were a religious mantra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach reached a new low last month during a North Carolina congressional debate at which all the Republican candidates chuckled at a question on climate&nbsp;change -- as if they had been asked about their belief in the Tooth Fairy. Is climate&nbsp;change a fact, they were asked. All four answered no. This is a shortsighted strategy that is wrong for the party, wrong for the country and wrong for the next generation. It simply kicks a big problem farther down the field. And it's a problem we -- as solution-seeking Republicans -- have the opportunity to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implications were underscored once again on Tuesday, when a team of more than 300 scientists warned in a report to the White House of ''mounting evidence that harm to the nation will increase substantially in the future unless global emissions of heat-trapping gases are greatly reduced.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our approach as a party should be one of neither denial nor extremism. Science must guide sensible policy discussions that will lead to well-informed choices, which may mean considering unexpected alternatives. We aren't inspiring much confidence, especially among millennials, who at least want an intelligent conversation on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the scales must be balanced. This means that the environmental community must be able to demonstrate a genuine appreciation for different perspectives. Discussions will not be productive if certain solutions are dismissed out of hand. This may mean accepting that natural gas or nuclear energy are part of our shorter-term horizon, rather than fighting those approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is room for some skepticism given the uncertainty about the magnitude of climate&nbsp;change, the fact is that the planet is warming, and failing to deal with this reality will leave us vulnerable -- and possibly worse. Hedging against risk is an enduring theme of conservative thought. It is also a concept diverse groups can embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Republicans can get to a place where science drives our thinking and actions, then we will be able to make progress. We need to plan for the impacts of climate&nbsp;change at all levels of government. We need to empower Republicans leading those efforts to make decisions and investments that benefit their constituents, the party and the planet. Denying the science will only hinder their chance for success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans need to get back to our foundational roots as catalysts for innovation and problem solving. The country is already on a positive trajectory, with 2012 greenhouse gas emissions down 10 percent from 2005 levels. What we need to do now is what we have always done well: combine our ingenuity and market forces to lock into that trajectory. As Teddy Roosevelt teaches us, it would be foolhardy to undermine the environmental richness that will serve to empower our future generations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should the world's priorities be? Is the most urgent task to guarantee everybody a minimum standard of subsistence? To reduce inequality? To combat global warming, perhaps at the expense of economic growth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the world even have a common set of goals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks as if it's well on the way to getting them. For the 11th time in just over a year, scores of diplomats from around the world are gathering this week at the United Nations to continue fine-tuning a vast wish list of national priorities into a tight set of humankind's most pressing challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By summer they are expected to produce a finished list of 10 or so, to be anointed by the United Nations General Assembly next year as the Sustainable Development Goals, intended to be a focus of global attention and resources over the following 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The S.D.G.s will provide the overarching narrative or explanation about how to make the world function adequately for its inhabitants and for the next generation,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a noted development economist at Columbia University, who heads a group of experts advising the United Nations on the goals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the good intentions, the breathtakingly ambitious enterprise might have a hard time overcoming not just the narrower priorities of the world's nation-states but also natural skepticism about the value of such development goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new crop of objectives is meant to succeed the eight Millennium Development Goals the United Nations set in 2000. Supporters like Professor Sachs argue that such goal-setting has helped draw resources to make progress on intractable problems that were often ignored in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new batch faces extra hurdles. It is much more ambitious. The list so far includes 16 goals, with some 140 specific targets, aimed not merely at helping the poor but at saving the entire world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goals include mitigating climate&nbsp;change, guaranteeing industrialization and good jobs for all, and promoting peaceful societies and the rule of law. Meeting them might seem like a stretch, considering that so many poor countries failed to reach the last ones, which aimed at straightforward targets like alleviating poverty and reducing infant and maternal mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other problem is that unlike 15 years ago -- when the United Nations secretary general then, Kofi Annan, simply put together a list -- this time around, everybody has a say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The tent is very large, and everyone is in it,'' a diplomat from a rich developed country told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a touchy diplomatic issue. ''Priorities differ, agendas differ. The willingness to take on commitments differs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich countries think good governance and peaceful societies are an essential part of the package. Many poor countries, by contrast, believe they are -- as noted in a statement from Brazil and Nicaragua -- a ''distraction from the basic social, economic and environmental challenges that we must address'' and things rich countries can use as conditions to release aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among developing countries, many big ones, like China and India, are more worried about maintaining robust economic growth than about combating climate&nbsp;change. Island nations like the Maldives, which lies less than six feet above sea level, worry more about what rising temperatures will do to the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a north-south divide and divides between countries in the north and in the south,'' a diplomat from a poor developing country told me. ''It's a very tiring process.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, better and worse ideas. Bjorn Lomborg of the Copenhagen Consensus, who achieved renown by arguing that current efforts to cut carbon emissions to slow climate&nbsp;change cost too much and deliver too little, argues that many of the new targets also fail the test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been making the rounds among diplomats, showing them the results of cost-benefit analyses of some of the ideas on the table: Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and removing barriers to women's employment are ''phenomenal'' ideas, likely to deliver benefits that are at least 15 times as great as their costs. Eliminating drug abuse, doubling the global share of renewable energy by 2030 and achieving protection of agricultural biodiversity are either ambiguous or would cost more than their expected benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These goals are going to mobilize up to $700 billion in resources,'' Mr. Lomborg told me. ''If we can just get one poor target replaced by one phenomenal target, we can generate billions in benefits.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension over the new set of global objectives extends beyond the quality of the individual goals, however. The deepest disagreements are over who will shoulder the burden of achieving them. Who will provide the money? How much? On what terms will the technology transfer from rich to poor occur? ''Everything that has to do with the 'how' is controversial,'' the rich-country diplomat told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of tension is not unique to these Sustainable Development Goals. From global trade to climate&nbsp;change, it comes up every time countries swap and apportion rights and responsibilities. It is probably easier to overcome in a debate over aspirational objectives like the S.D.G.s than in more bare-knuckled negotiations over things like limits on carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, such divergent views highlight an essential question: Can common targets actually push development forward?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Easterly, a development economist at New York University, is one of the profession's most determined skeptics. Global development experts, he says, mistake development for an engineering problem that experts like themselves can correctly identify and address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the real world, Professor Easterly says, development occurs as people identify problems and push for solutions through their political systems. Setting global goals that nobody is truly accountable for achieving not only misrepresents what causes poverty but also substitutes goal-setting for real action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial development goals, he says, were just ''a brilliant campaign by the U.N. to get a bigger seat at the table,'' muscling into turf that until then had been the domain of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arvind Subramanian, a development economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, shares a similar perspective. While there are crucial challenges that call for international collaboration (climate&nbsp;change, new vaccines for diseases of the developing world and technologies to advance agricultural productivity in Africa come to mind), problems like poor education, malnutrition and poverty are invariably addressed by action within each individual country. Foreign aid is not the right tool to address them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Collective action in this day and age has become much more difficult,'' Mr. Subramanian told me. ''We should reserve it for the very big challenges of providing global public goods. It's nonsense to spend it on eliminating poverty in Burundi.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Sachs disagrees. For him, the mobilization of resources by the Millennium Development Goals for combating AIDS and malaria in Africa was more significant than the fact that the continent didn't achieve many of the goals. ''Even if they didn't do everything one hoped for,'' he said, ''they created an energy, a drive, an organizational knowledge, an interest in community action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even Professor Sachs wonders whether almost 200 countries can fit their priorities into a meaningful set of actionable goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's cooperation now,'' he said. ''But actually doing something about the hard issues remains an open question.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford University announced Tuesday that it would divest its $18.7 billion endowment of stock in coal-mining companies, becoming the first major university to lend support to a nationwide campaign to purge endowments and pension funds of fossil fuel investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university said it acted in accordance with internal guidelines that allow its trustees to consider whether ''corporate policies or practices create substantial social injury'' when choosing investments. Coal's status as a major source of carbon pollution linked to climate&nbsp;change persuaded the trustees to remove companies ''whose principal business is coal'' from their investment portfolio, the university said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford's associate vice president for communications, Lisa Lapin, said the decision covers about 100 companies worldwide that derive the majority of their revenue from coal extraction. Not all of those companies are in the university's investment portfolio, whose structure is private, she said. Over all, the university's coal holdings are a small fraction of its endowment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But a small percentage is still a substantial amount of money,'' she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trustees' decision carries more symbolic than financial weight, but it is a major victory for a rapidly growing student-led divestment movement that is now active at roughly 300 universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 11 small universities have elected to remove fossil-fuel stocks from their endowments, but none approaches Stanford's prestige or national influence. Tuesday's decision seems likely to increase the pressure on other major universities to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other universities, Harvard has resisted student pressure for divestment, and one student was arrested on Thursday after pro-divestment activists blockaded the entrance to the school's administrative offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford's trustees acted after Fossil Free Stanford, the campus branch of the movement, petitioned the board to re-evaluate the university's holdings in energy companies, Ms. Lapin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yari Greaney, 20, a Fossil Free Stanford organizer, said the group was ''very proud of Stanford taking this leadership position.'' Nationally, leaders of the divestment movement praised the school for its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a global institution, Stanford ''knows the havoc that climate&nbsp;change creates around our planet,'' Bill McKibben, the president and co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, said in a statement. ''Other forward-looking and internationally minded institutions will follow, I'm sure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maura Cowley, the executive director of Energy Action Coalition, an assemblage of groups active on climate&nbsp;change issues, called the decision ''a huge, huge victory.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their decision, coming from such a major university and from such a huge endowment, shows that the coal industry and other fossil fuel industries are quickly becoming relics of the past,'' she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trustees began studying divestment after Fossil Free Stanford petitioned them to re-evaluate their holdings of energy companies. An advisory panel that included students, faculty, staff and alumni spent roughly five months studying the issue before recommending that coal stocks be sold, Deborah DeCotis, the chairwoman of the board's special committee on investment responsibility, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other deciding factors, Ms. DeCotis said, the panel noted that coal produces the most carbon per British thermal unit of any widely used fossil fuel, that practical alternatives to burning coal are available, and that the university was not dependent on coal or coal-derived products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other fossil fuels did not meet some of those criteria, but ''this is not the ending point. It's a process,'' she said. ''We're a research institute, and as the technology develops to make other forms of alternative energy sources available, we will continue to review and make decisions about things we should not be invested in. Don't interpret this as a pass on other things.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Lapin said the school is already asking its investment advisers to review endowment holdings and sell stocks of coal companies. The order covers mutual funds with coal stocks as well as investments in individual companies, she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to now, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has been playing a weak hand in Ukraine very well. I mean, how strong are you when your allies insist on wearing masks? But Putin thinks he knows his adversaries better than they know themselves. He thinks the Americans will never be serious about energy, that the Europeans will never be serious about sanctions, that the Ukrainian reformers will never be serious about governance, and that he can control the separatist forces he's unleashed in eastern Ukraine and dial them up or down as he pleases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of the Ukraine crisis rides primarily on whether he is right about all this. How's his bet going so far?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been much talk about President Obama's ''leadership'' of late. All I know is that, if Obama wants it, Ukraine provides him an ideal legacy leadership opportunity. With one initiative he could simultaneously make America stronger, Putin weaker, the planet healthier and our grandchildren safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since we've ruled out sending troops, our short-term ability to influence Putin has to rely on targeted sanctions. But the serious way to weaken Putin, whose economy and government budget is hugely dependent on $100-plus-a-barrel-oil, is with an American domestic grand bargain on energy that unleashes forces that, over time, begin to impact the global price and availability of oil and gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama should summon the congressional leadership to Camp David and put his own plan on the table: Offer the Republicans the Keystone XL pipeline, expanded oil drilling and fracking (but only at the highest environmental standards) and, in return, demand a revenue-neutral carbon tax, a national renewable portfolio standard that would require every utility in America to gradually introduce more renewable power, and a national California-level home building code for energy efficiency. I would also toss in incentives for expanding the share of nuclear power in our energy mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate Keystone, which brings disgusting tar sands oil from Canada, and I worry about fracking at low environmental standards, but I'd take this deal in a second because, soon enough, a proper carbon tax would make oil from tar sands uneconomical, and fracking that is paired with a renewable portfolio standard would ensure that natural gas replaces coal not solar, wind and other renewables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House just released a study that found the effects of human-induced climate&nbsp;change impacting every corner of our country, not to mention the world. So such a grand bargain could not be a more timely and necessary win-win-win strategy. It would simultaneously increase our leverage against Putin and Mother Nature. And it would drive a suite of technologies down their cost-curves so we can deploy them at scale and ensure that America is the leader in the next great global industry: clean technology. Obama should throw caution to the wind and go big. If Republicans won't meet him even halfway on this (yes, I know, unlikely) it would expose them as unwilling to do the things that would meaningfully deter Putin, not to mention buy some insurance against climate&nbsp;change with policies that would make us stronger and healthier even if climate&nbsp;change turns out to be milder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go big, Mr. President. Get crazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as I said, Putin thinks he knows us better than we know ourselves, that we are all hat and no cattle. He is not without reason: for decades, both parties in America have failed to develop an energy strategy, and we've paid for it -- with oil price shocks, wars, pollution and climate&nbsp;change. Are we forever condemned to be takers, not makers, of energy policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Putin thinks he knows the Europeans better, since so many are beneficiaries of his oil and gas. So far, Europe's response has been more hand-ringing about Putin than neck-wringing of Putin. They talk softly and carry a big baguette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ukrainian reformers, too, have a huge role to play. They must find a way to conduct free and fair elections in as much of Ukraine as possible on May 25 and then quickly move to parliamentary elections and constitutional reform to put in place the basis for decent governance. The last thing Putin wants is a fairly elected reformist government in Kiev that would have the legitimacy to associate Ukraine with the European Union. Therefore, it's the first thing Ukrainians must do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Putin needs to beware. The separatist allies he ginned up with his agents and Goebbels-scale propaganda campaign in eastern Ukraine could spin out of control. The Putin-inspired separatists could persuade western Ukraine that there is no future with the East, and Kiev might just let them all fall into Putin's lap -- and economic responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin may think he's Superman, but, the fact is, America, Europe and the Ukrainian reformers collectively have the ability to generate the Kryptonite that would render him powerless: European unity, Ukrainian government legitimacy and U.S. energy. Those are the things of which he is most afraid. What they all have in common, though, is that they're hard, entail serious choices and will require extraordinary leadership to achieve. So watch all these fronts. I can assure you that Putin is.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effects of human-induced climate&nbsp;change are being felt in every corner of the United States, scientists reported Tuesday, with water growing scarcer in dry regions, torrential rains increasing in wet regions, heat waves becoming more common and more severe, wildfires growing worse, and forests dying under assault from heat-loving insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such sweeping changes have been caused by an average warming of less than 2 degrees Fahrenheit over most land areas of the country in the past century, the scientists found. If greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane continue to escalate at a rapid pace, they said, the warming could conceivably exceed 10 degrees by the end of this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,'' the scientists declared in a major new report assessing the situation in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Summers are longer and hotter, and extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced,'' the report continued. ''Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is the latest in a series of dire warnings about how the effects of global warming that had been long foreseen by climate scientists are already affecting the planet. Its region-by-region documentation of changes occurring in the United States, and of future risks, makes clear that few places will be unscathed -- and some, like northerly areas, are feeling the effects at a swifter pace than had been expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska in particular is hard hit. Glaciers and frozen ground in that state are melting, storms are eating away at fragile coastlines no longer protected by winter sea ice, and entire communities are having to flee inland -- a precursor of the large-scale changes the report foresees for the rest of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, known as the National Climate Assessment, was prepared by a large scientific panel overseen by the government and received final approval at a meeting Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House, which released the report, wants to maximize its impact to drum up a sense of urgency among Americans about climate&nbsp;change -- and thus to build political support for a contentious new climate&nbsp;change regulation that President Obama plans to issue in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead of giving a Rose Garden speech, President Obama spent Tuesday giving interviews to local and national weather broadcasters on climate&nbsp;change and extreme weather. The goal was to help Americans connect the vast planetary problem of global warming caused by carbon emissions from cars and coal plants to the changing conditions in their own backyards. It was a strategic decision that senior White House staff members had been planning for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Al Roker of NBC News, in an interview scheduled to be shown Wednesday morning on the ''Today'' show, Mr. Obama said ''This is not some distant problem of the future. This is a problem that is affecting Americans right now. Whether it means increased flooding, greater vulnerability to drought, more severe wildfires -- all these things are having an impact on Americans as we speak.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Northeast, the report found a big increase in torrential rains and risks from a rising sea that could lead to a repeat of the kind of flooding seen in Hurricane Sandy. In the Southwest, the water shortages seen to date are likely just a foretaste of the changes to come, the report found. In that region, the report warned, ''severe and sustained drought will stress water sources, already overutilized in many areas, forcing increasing competition among farmers, energy producers, urban dwellers and plant and animal life for the region's most precious resource.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report did find some benefits from climate&nbsp;change in the short run, particularly for the Midwest, such as a longer growing season for crops and a longer shipping season on the Great Lakes. But it warned that these were likely to be countered in the long run by escalating damages, particularly to agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Yes, climate&nbsp;change is already here,'' said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in writing the report. ''But the costs so far are still on the low side compared to what will be coming under business as usual by late in this century.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was supervised and approved by a large committee representing a cross section of American society, including representatives of two oil companies. It is the third national report in 14 years, and by far the most urgent in tone, leaving little doubt that the scientists consider climate&nbsp;change an incipient crisis. It is also the most slickly produced, with an elaborate package of interactive graphics on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the report's most striking findings concerned the rising frequency of torrential rains. Scientists have expected this effect for decades because more water is evaporating from a warming ocean surface, and the warmer atmosphere is able to hold the excess vapor, which then falls as rain or snow. But even the leading experts have been surprised by the scope of the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that the eastern half of the country is receiving more precipitation in general. And over the past half-century, the proportion of precipitation that is falling in very heavy rain events has jumped by 71 percent in the Northeast, by 37 percent in the Midwest and by 27 percent in the South, the report found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a big change,'' said Radley M. Horton, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York who helped write the report. He added that scientists do not fully understand the regional variations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, sudden intense rains have caused extensive damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, large parts of Nashville were devastated by floods in 2010 after nearly 20 inches of rain fell in two days. Last year, parts of Colorado flooded after getting as much rain in a week as normally falls in a year. Just last week, widespread devastation occurred in the Florida Panhandle from rains that may have exceeded two feet in 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new report emphasized that people should not expect global warming to happen at a steady pace, nor at the same rate throughout the country. Bitterly cold winters will continue to occur, the report said, even as they become somewhat less likely. Warming, too, will vary. While most of the country has warmed sharply over the past century, the Southeast has barely warmed at all, and a section of southern Alabama has even cooled slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report cited the likely role of climate&nbsp;change in causing an outbreak of mountain pine beetles that has devastated millions of acres of pine forest across the American West and the Canadian province of British Columbia; warmer winters and longer summers have let more of the beetles survive and reproduce at an exponential rate. And the report warned of severe, long-lasting heat waves. For instance, it cited research saying the type of record-breaking heat that scorched Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 had become substantially more likely because of the human release of greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On rising sea levels, the new report went beyond warnings issued in September by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, which said that by the end of the century, sea levels could rise by as much as three feet globally if emissions continue at a rapid pace. The American scientists said the rise could be anywhere from one to four feet, and added that six feet could not be ruled out. Along much of the East Coast, the situation will be worse than the global average because the land there is sinking, the scientists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, the United States was responsible for more emissions than any other country. Lately, China has become the largest emitter over all, though its emissions per person are still far below those of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report pointed out that while the country as a whole still had no comprehensive climate legislation, many states and cities had begun to take steps to limit emissions and to adapt to climatic changes that can no longer be avoided. But the report found that these efforts were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is mounting evidence that harm to the nation will increase substantially in the future unless global emissions of heat-trapping gases are greatly reduced,'' the report warned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Jim Gandy is the chief meteorologist on WLTX in Columbia, S.C., and makes a point of incorporating links between bad weather and climate&nbsp;change into his daily broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In Columbia, the only thing that separates us from hell in the summertime is a screen door,'' he said in an interview. ''And all of the climate models indicate that it's going to get worse if we don't do something about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Gandy was among eight weather broadcasters invited to interview President Obama and spend the day at the White House. From Al Roker of the ''Today'' show to local weathermen and women from Chicago, Miami, Seattle and other cities, the handpicked guests were there, the administration hoped, to spread the word contained in a landmark new report, the National Climate Assessment, that the warming climate is causing sweeping change across the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that local television weathercasters are among the most trusted media figures, but there is a deep divide between those who accept the link between human activities and global warming and extreme weather and those who do not. A 2011 study by George Mason University found, for example, that just 18 percent of American television weather broadcasters believe the established science that human activities, specifically burning fossil fuels, contribute to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcasters at the White House on Tuesday not only accept the link, a number of them also prepare their climate-focused broadcasts with help from Climate Central, a New Jersey-based nonprofit group that creates graphics intended to convey the local impact of climate&nbsp;change for about 100 television stations across the country. Some Climate Central scientists were among those invited Tuesday to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also there was John Morales, who delivers weather forecasts on WTVJ in Miami and covers weather disasters for the Spanish-language Telemundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Recently we've had extreme weather events, like the strong rains in Pensacola and Tampa,'' Mr. Morales said in an interview. ''In January, Palm Beach County got 22 inches of rain in eight hours. That's a once in a thousand-year event. I mention on my broadcasts that the propensity for climate&nbsp;change will increase with these events.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Obama has given several speeches about climate&nbsp;change, a Pew Research Center poll this year showed that Americans rank climate&nbsp;change 19th out of 20 in importance on a list of policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy of using local weathercasters to spread the word is in keeping with other White House efforts to use nontraditional media outlets to get policy messages out, said Jennifer Palmieri, the White House communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trusted messengers are hugely important,'' Ms. Palmieri said. ''No one thinks these meterologists have an agenda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week was not the first time a White House has tried to use local weathercasters to deliver a message on climate&nbsp;change. During the Clinton administration, Vice President Al Gore invited weathercasters to broadcast a climate&nbsp;change event from the White House South Lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paul Bledsoe, who was a top climate&nbsp;change communications official in the Clinton White House, did not recall it fondly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a complete disaster, and it backfired,'' Mr. Bledsoe said. Mr. Gore forced the weathercasters to watch his slideshow on global warming, he said, and then lectured them for failing to talk about climate&nbsp;change in their broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bledsoe said that the current White House massaging of weathercaster may meet with more success -- in part because the new report indicates that climate&nbsp;change is now having a more measurable impact on weather than it did in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gandy of WLTX in South Carolina, for one, does not need much convincing. Last year he reported on research from Duke University linking increased carbon content in the atmosphere to a stronger outbreak of poison ivy in the Columbia region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a real eye-opener,'' Mr. Gandy said, adding that the segment got a huge audience response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As President Obama sets out to convince the public that climate&nbsp;change requires immediate attention, he has his work cut out for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more than people in any other rich nation, Americans are skeptical that climate&nbsp;change is a dire issue. In Pew Research Center surveys conducted last spring, 40 percent of Americans said that global climate&nbsp;change was a major threat to their country. More than 50 percent of Canadians, Australians, French and Germans gave that answer. More than 60 percent of Italians and Spaniards did. And more than 70 percent of Japanese did.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, a Gallup survey conducted in early March found that a third of Americans said they personally worry about global warming or climate&nbsp;change a great deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans rarely cite environmental concerns when asked in polls to name the most important problem facing the country. In the last several years, the economy, jobs, the budget deficit and health care garnered the most mentions, with the environment barely registering. In the Pew poll, fewer Americans cited climate&nbsp;change as a top threat than cited financial instability, Islamic extremism, Iran's nuclear program or North Korea's nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Middle East was the only other region that did not have a majority seeing the issue as a major threat. Fewer than 20 percent of respondents in Egypt or Pakistan viewed it as a big threat, and 30 percent in Israel did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many other middle-income or poor countries, concern over climate&nbsp;change was higher than in rich countries or as high. Scientists predict that climate&nbsp;change will cause larger problems for poor countries than rich ones, partly because many poorer countries are already naturally hot or prone to extreme weather. But all countries will be affected, scientists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scientific report issued Tuesday on the effects of climate&nbsp;change in the United States concluded, ''Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dana Nuccitelli: Contrarian climate scientist Roy Spencer put forth the top 10 'skeptic' arguments - all are easily answered</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy Spencer is one of the less than 3% of climate scientists whose research suggests that humans are playing a relatively minimal role in global warming. As one of those rare contrarian climate experts, he's often asked to testify before US Congress and interviewed by media outlets that want to present a 'skeptical' or false balance climate narrative. He's also a rather controversial figure, having made remarks about &quot;global warming Nazis&quot; and said,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimize the role of government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, as one of those rare contrarian climate scientists, Spencer is in a good position to present the best arguments against the global warming consensus. Conveniently, he recently did just that on his blog, listing what he considers the &quot;Top Ten Good Skeptical Arguments,&quot; throwing in an 11th for good measure. He also conveniently posed each of these arguments as questions; it turns out they're all easy to answer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) No Recent Warming. If global warming science is so &quot;settled&quot;, why did global warming stop 15 years ago, contrary to all &quot;consensus&quot; predictions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite simply, it hasn't. Even global surface temperatures (which is how Spencer is likely measuring 'global warming', although they only account for about 2% of the Earth's warming), have warmed about 0.2&deg;Cover the past 15 years, according to the best available measurements. More importantly, the planet has continued to accumulate heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second over the past 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) Natural or Manmade? If we don't know how much of recent warming is natural, then how can we know how much is manmade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IPCC stated with 95% confidence that most of the global warming since 1950 is human-caused, with a best estimate that 100% is due to humans over the past 60 years. The IPCC was able to draw this conclusion with such high confidence because that's what the scientific evidence and research clearly and consistently concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3) IPCC Politics and Beliefs. Why does it take a political body (the IPCC) to tell us what scientists &quot;believe&quot;? And when did scientists' &quot;beliefs&quot; translate into proof? And when was scientific truth determined by a vote...especially when those allowed to vote are from the Global Warming Believers Party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IPCC merely organizes the world's top climate scientists every 5 to 7 years. It's those scientists who summarize the up-to-date status of the scientific research in their respective fields of expertise. The IPCC report and the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming are themselves not proof of anything. They summarize and reflect the scientific evidence - that vast body of evidence is the reason the consensus exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4) Climate Models Can't Even Hindcast. How did climate modelers, who already knew the answer, still fail to explain the lack of a significant temperature rise over the last 30+ years? In other words, how to you botch a hindcast?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global surface temperatures have risen more than 0.5&deg;C over the past 30 years. That rise is significant, both in the statistical and figurative sense. Climate models have accurately reproduced that rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5) ...But We Should Believe Model Forecasts? Why should we believe model predictions of the future, when they can't even explain the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate models have accurately reproduced the past, but let's put them aside for a moment. We don't need climate models to project future global warming. We know from past climate&nbsp;change events the planet will warm between about 1.5 and 4.5&deg;C from the increased greenhouse effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (the 'climate sensitivity').</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a business-as-usual scenario, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are expected to surpass 900 ppm by 2100 - that's close to two doublings from the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. Hence we know that business-as-usual will cause between 2.5 and 7.5&deg;C (most likely 5&deg;C) warming if we stop carbon dioxide levels from rising beyond about 900 ppm. This is based on simple math and what we know about the physics of the climate - no fancy models needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6) Modelers Lie About Their &quot;Physics&quot;. Why do modelers insist their models are based upon established physics, but then hide the fact that the strong warming their models produce is actually based upon very uncertain &quot;fudge factor&quot; tuning?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting aside the accusation that hundreds of climate modelers are all liars - the answer is that their models are indeed based upon well established physics. NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt's TED talk on the subject is well worth watching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's question likely refers to the uncertain size of the cooling influence of aerosols. However, that is a physical uncertainty. We don't have very good measurements of this effect; unfortunately the rocket carrying NASA's Glory satellite that had instruments to measure the climate effect of aerosols crashed two years ago. Nevertheless, climate models use the available data to account for their influence, and their projections include the associated uncertainties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7) Is Warming Even Bad? Who decided that a small amount of warming is necessarily a bad thing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're headed for about 5&deg;C global surface warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 if we continue on a business-as-usual path. 5&deg;C is the difference between average temperatures now and those during the last ice age. That's not &quot;small&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. As for who decided that amount warming is a bad thing -&nbsp;climate scientists researching the impacts of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8) Is CO2 Bad? How did carbon dioxide, necessary for life on Earth and only 4 parts in 10,000 of our atmosphere, get rebranded as some sort of dangerous gas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon dioxide itself is not &quot;bad.&quot; Water is also necessary for life. Too much water will kill you. Too much carbon dioxide causes dangerous climate&nbsp;change. Greenhouse gases were determined to be pollutants as defined in the US Clean Air Act . This was a ruling of the (politically conservative) US Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9) Do We Look that Stupid? How do scientists expect to be taken seriously when their &quot;theory&quot; is supported by both floods AND droughts? Too much snow AND too little snow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This question is a bit like asking, &quot;Do I look fat?&quot;. Do you want an honest answer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warming of the atmosphere, happening especially at high latitudes, reduces the temperature difference between higher and lower latitudes. This tends to make storms move more slowly. This results in storms dumping more precipitation in localized areas, which causes more flooding in those areas and droughts outside of them. Higher temperatures also increase evaporation, exacerbating droughts and adding more moisture to the air for stronger storms. A climate scientist should understand these concepts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10) Selective Pseudo-Explanations. How can scientists claim that the Medieval Warm Period (which lasted hundreds of years), was just a regional fluke...yet claim the single-summer (2003) heat wave in Europe had global significance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no contradiction here - a regional event can have global significance, for example via economic impacts. In any case, the Medieval Warm Period was a regional phenomenon and the planet as a whole was cooler than today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11) (Spinal Tap bonus) Just How Warm is it, Really? Why is it that every subsequent modification/adjustment to the global thermometer data leads to even more warming? What are the chances of that? Either a warmer-still present, or cooling down the past, both of which produce a greater warming trend over time. And none of the adjustments take out a gradual urban heat island (UHI) warming around thermometer sites, which likely exists at virtually all of them - because no one yet knows a good way to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, most of the adjustments to Spencer's own satellite temperature data set have been in the warming direction, so this question may be an example of psychological projection. Scientists also recently identified a problem in Arctic temperature data analysis that's leading to an incorrect adjustment in the cooling direction, and there have of course been other cooling adjustments in the surface temperature record. The urban heat island effect has also been demonstrated over and over to have no significant influence on the surface temperature record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notice a Pattern?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may have noticed some patterns in these questions. Most are based on false premises and are trivially simple to answer. These 'top ten good skeptic arguments' are frankly not very good or challenging. They also reveal a very one-sided skepticism, although to his credit Spencer did also list 10 'skeptic' arguments that don't hold water. These are glaringly wrong arguments like 'there is no greenhouse effect' and 'CO2 cools the atmosphere,' that some contrarians nevertheless believe. Interestingly, Spencer discusses the science disproving the 10 bad arguments, but there's no scientific discussion supporting his to 'good' arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From reading and answering Spencer's questions, we learn that the basic science behind how we know humans are causing global warming and that it's a problem are quite well-established. There are some remaining uncertainties, like how much warming is being offset by aerosol cooling, but overall we have a very strong understanding of the big picture. For quite a while now we've understood the Earth's climate well enough to know that we can't continue on our current high-risk path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When will we stop using these trivially wrong contrarian arguments as an excuse for climate inaction? Now that's a tough question to answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During last year's harvest, Rom&aacute;n Lec, who grows coffee on a few acres here, lost half his crop. This year, he borrowed about $2,000 for fertilizer and fungicide to protect the plants, as he did last year. But the disease returned and he lost even more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are nights when you cannot sleep, thinking how to pay back the money,'' said Mr. Lec, 65.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plant-choking fungus called coffee rust, or la roya, has swept across Central America, withering trees and slashing production everywhere. As exports have plunged over the last two years, the effects have rippled through the local economies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big farmers hire fewer workers to pick the ripe coffee cherries that enclose the beans. Smaller farmers go into debt and sell livestock or tools to make up for the lost income. Sales fall at local merchants. Teenagers leave school to work on the farm because their parents can no longer hire outside help. At the very end of the chain are the landless migrant workers who earn just a few dollars a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you frame this in terms of everyone that is connected to the economics of coffee, it's a very serious problem,'' said Roberto de Michele, a specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank who is based in Guatemala City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coffee rust has spread far and fast, driven by higher temperatures in the region that have allowed the fungus to thrive at higher altitudes. Many experts say climate&nbsp;change is largely to blame for the shifting weather patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economics of the business have added to the farmers' plight. After years of low coffee prices, smaller farmers could not afford to replace aging coffee plants, which have proved more vulnerable to the rust's attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There was nothing to hold it back because the farms were in very poor shape,'' said Maja Wallengren, a coffee expert based in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble here is just one of several factors that are pushing up prices in the global commodity market, increases that may carry over to supermarket shelves and the specialty coffee houses that sell the high-grade arabica coffee for which Central America is known. Market prices have risen 70 to 80 percent since November, driven mostly by drought in Brazil, the world's largest producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Central America, the pain is acute. Four million people there and in southern Mexico rely on coffee for their living, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. Twenty percent of the half-million jobs in Guatemala directly tied to the crop have already disappeared, estimated Nils Leporowski, the president of Anacaf&eacute;, the country's coffee board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rust outbreak has pushed many families to the edge of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Roya has exposed the depth of the social and economic problems in terms of people's vulnerability to the market and to climate&nbsp;change,'' said Peter Loach, the Guatemala director of Mercy Corps, an aid agency. ''What makes it different and complicated is that it's a slow-onset natural disaster over two to three years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in good years, Jos&eacute; Obispo Tax Tal&eacute;, 34, had to scrimp to feed his eight children. In the past, his work as a day laborer on coffee farms would give him just enough money to rent land, buy fertilizer and grow corn for food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the coffee rust hit, farmers are hiring fewer workers and paying less. So Mr. Tax had to borrow about $1,300 to grow corn. ''Sometimes, you get desperate,'' he said. ''You want to work, but there is none.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the lean season, when food supplies run out for the poorest farmers, started two months early, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a monitoring service, because of falling coffee earnings and reduced corn yields over the last couple of years. Forecasts of irregular rainfall this summer raise additional concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Year after year, these families are confronted by layers of vulnerability,'' said Anne Valand of the World Food Programme, who estimated that as many as 300,000 Guatemalans could need emergency food aid later this year. ''Bit by bit, the layers are becoming thinner.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the coffee rust has taken hold, farmers have been spending much of their time and money trying to fight the disease by spraying fungicide, replacing or cutting back old plants, and managing the shade trees that filter sunlight and appear to reduce the spread of the rust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are scared of the roya,'' said Nicol&aacute;s Leja, who farms about seven acres in plots in San Antonio Palop&oacute;, a nearby municipality. He pruned his trees and sprayed fungicide, but it proved futile. He has lost as much as 60 percent of his production over the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of hiring four workers for the harvest as he usually does, he relied on extra labor from his 18-year-old son, who put off plans to study medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changing fortunes of Guatemala's small farmers raise the question of whether some of them should continue to grow coffee at all or instead should switch to food crops. Some say they could not make the change even if they wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Beans and corn don't grow well here,'' Mr. Leja said, pointing at the steep hillside. ''The coffee income is very important. It pays for corn and beans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest epidemic of coffee rust began in Central America three years ago. It spread rapidly last year, prompting most governments to declare states of emergency. Last year's harvest fell 15 percent in Guatemala, and neighboring countries had losses as big and even bigger. Export figures suggest that Guatemala's harvest this year has fallen an additional 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody has escaped. Guillermo R&iacute;os, a midsize producer who grows coffee on 37 acres near the Mexican border in Huehuetenango, said he had sprayed fungicide four times and managed to limit the outbreak to just 10 percent of the plantation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My priority is to rescue what I invested,'' he said in a telephone interview. But his profit was minimal, and the higher costs have halted his plans to add plants on additional land he owns. He will hire fewer workers than he expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While rust hit Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, the outbreaks were contained at lower altitudes. This rust outbreak has advanced to the highest altitudes, including the steep slopes here around Lake Atitl&aacute;n. Rising temperatures and extreme weather, like flooding, have encouraged roya's spread, said Ana R. R&iacute;os, a climate&nbsp;change specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the changing conditions, the industry is intensifying efforts to breed varieties that are resistant to rust and heat stress while maintaining their quality. But the research is only beginning, and it may take 25 or 30 years before resistant hybrids reach farmers, said Leonardo Lombardini, the deputy director of World Coffee Research at Texas A&amp;M University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The problem is that farmers are struggling and also the climate is changing rapidly,'' Mr. Lombardini said. ''The window of climate conditions for arabica is relatively narrow.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers are also growing plants from seeds collected all over the world and sending them to different countries for field trials to see where they thrive. That should give farmers who do not have much money to invest some assurances that when they replace their old trees, the new ones will be productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the priority is returning the farms to health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guatemala's agriculture ministry provided small farmers with fungicide last year, although many complained that it reached them too late or that it was not enough. Others simply sold it. The government has increased the amount of money in a fund to provide low-interest loans to $100 million and extended it to 2026. The fund had only $28 million when the measure was approved last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The coffee here is positioned for its quality like the wines of France,'' said Jos&eacute; Sebasti&aacute;n Marcucci, Guatemala's vice minister of agriculture. ''The majority of coffee comes from the small producers. I hope that they can be motivated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With help from Anacaf&eacute;, the government is showing farmers how to prune and replace their trees. They also plant beans and vegetables between the coffee seedlings to provide food while they wait three years for them to start producing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more farmers are listening. Servando Santos, 56, the manager at the San Miguel Integrated Agricultural Cooperative in Tzampetey, said he fought off the rust by spraying fungicide, using fertilizer and controlling the shade over his plants. ''You have to adapt to the roya,'' he said. ''You have to make friends with it.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The two science academies under Pope Francis hold a rare joint meeting to chart paths to sustainable development. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VATICAN CITY - For four long days, several dozen physical, environmental and social scientists hunkered here with theologians, philosophers, economists and a poverty campaigner to explore ways to balance human ambitions with the planet's limits. The rare joint meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences - &quot;Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature, Our Responsibility&quot; - helped demarcate where science leaves off and the rest of society, including organized religion, plays a role in shaping the quality of human life and environmental conditions in this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subtext, of course, was that Pope Francis, who made time to meet briefly with the participants for photographs and a short chat, is working on a possible encyclical letter on the environment and sustainable development. (The columnist John L. Allen, Jr., provides some helpful background in the Boston Globe.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presentations focused on deepening inequality, the evidence for dangerous climate&nbsp;change, population trends, urban problems, new economic models and more. [There's a problem with the link to the presentations; I'll add it here when it's working.]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this meeting was planned before Francis was selected, many participants were hoping some of the themes might influence that document, particularly with the United Nations closing in on a set of Sustainable Development Goals and a fresh effort to negotiate a new climate treaty coming to a head in late 2015. On hand were some remarkable people, including four Nobel laureates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was invited to present a summary of my impressions as the meeting drew to a close tonight. I found much to be optimistic about. You can watch my remarks on YouTube [scroll to 13:42:00] or read them below as prepared for the interpreters and participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a different take on the climate challenge, watch Naomi Oreskes, the Harvard sociologist, describe her research on scientists as sentinels and her new book of fictional future climate history, &quot;The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future,&quot; co-written with Erik M. Conway. [Her section begins at 11:10:50.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the text of my remarks, which I titled &quot;Charting a Sustainable Human Journey - The Roles of Data, Values, Will and Love&quot;:<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a great honor to be invited to attend this remarkable workshop, and it is a more humbling honor to be invited now to reflect on these remarkable presentations and conversations - spanning a range of fields from glaciology to psychology and a range of experience from that of a 96-year-old oceanographer to that of a 30-year-old advocate for street workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a generalist informed by three decades of reporting on the interface of science and society, from the North Pole to the Amazon, I approach this task with the advice of the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When faced with complex problems, he has said, the wisest course is to take a &quot;crude look at the whole.&quot; That's what I'll attempt to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In convening experts from across the natural and social sciences under the mantle of one of the world's great faiths, Chancellor Sorondo and the other organizers have beautifully reflected the realities underpinning our species' challenge at the dawn of an era of Earth history that is increasingly under our influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Pope Francis chose to greet us today reflects his passion for harmonizing human relations and our relationship with this living planet. In this focus, the Pope is building on a foundation laid by Saint Francis, who - as several here have noted -called creatures and creation kin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our predicament in an age some have named for us - the Anthropocene - was nicely captured by Cardinal &Oacute;scar Andr&eacute;s Rodr&iacute;guez Maradiaga on the first day here when he said, &quot;Nowadays man finds himself to be a technical giant and an ethical child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanity, in essence, is in a race between potency and awareness. The outcome will determine the quality of our species' journey and will leave an indelible mark, for better or worse, on the planet we inhabit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, I proposed that we are experiencing &quot;puberty on the scale of a planet.&quot; Global trends echo that awkward, sometimes damaging, transition from teenage-style ebullience to the more measured norms of adulthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just as a teenager resists calls from elders to grow up, societies - only naturally - have been initially resistant to scientists' warnings of irreversible damage to the planet's biological patrimony, risks attending unabated climate&nbsp;change and long-distance impacts of consumptive resource appetites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, science has done its job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical and biological sciences, along with revolutionary advances in technology - from satellites to supercomputers - have provided a clarifying picture of human-driven environmental changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychological and sociological studies have revealed deeply ingrained human traits, many shaped by our evolutionary history as a &quot;here and now&quot; species, that prevent us from acting rationally in the face of threats with long time scales, dispersed impacts and inherent complexity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible paths have been delineated in recent decades using ever more sophisticated models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is where science's task ends. It is up to individuals and societies to choose which paths to pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientific knowledge reveals options. Values determine choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why the Roman Catholic Church - with its global reach, the ethical framework in its social justice teachings and, as with all great religions, the ability to reach hearts as well as minds - can play a valuable role in this consequential century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly true for planet-scale problems like human-driven climate&nbsp;change, in which governments tend to put national interests ahead of planet-scale interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decisions at the scale of cities, towns, school boards, corporate boards - even households - will, in a cumulative way, be enormously influential and are more apt to be directly shaped by the worldviews and priorities of individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prismatic way, those gathered here have made the compelling case that it is a combination of knowledge, faith, will and love that will determine the quality of the human journey in this consequential and complicated century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on that in a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, as so many of the participants have conveyed, sustaining humanity on a verdant planet is not an either/or choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While data matter enormously, number crunching will not determine the resulting balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While choices are shaped by values, values are shaped by upbringing and experience. That means there is room for positive change, particularly through commerce in ideas and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Nancy Knowlton explained in the context of the ailing oceans, revealed connections between causes and effects, together with empathy and a menu of solutions, can spark shifts in behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the commitment to remain true to a choice and to pursue it through thick and thin requires more than values. It is a function of individual and communal will, as well, as Archbishop Minnerath aptly noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research and ideas presented here revealed another important reality. Given the variegated nature of cultures, worldviews and conditions around the world, it's clear that humanity will follow many paths in the decades ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for global and enforceable standards are creditable, but face huge hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just consider Stefano Zamagni's point about the many different forms of ethics in different countries, or Professor Schellnhuber's description of the wickedly complex array of interests and development stages perennially clashing in climate treaty negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reality is that global environmental and social challenges are not the work of a single generation, not problem to fix - but issues to work on perennially as a normal part of how we live and develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written before that what the world needs is an improbable mix of &quot;urgency and patience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To grasp why this will take time, consider Edith Brown Weiss's sobering conclusion that &quot;Earth has become a global commons&quot; knowing that, as Charles Perrings explained, &quot;If we value things at zero they'll be wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And consider Joe Stiglitz's sobering data on the widening gulfs between haves and have-nots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigating these questions can lead one feeling sapped and paralyzed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in these sessions I also saw abundant reason for optimism, empowerment and, most importantly, action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were Gretchen Daily's many examples of successful efforts to incorporate previously unmeasured values of living resources into decision-making at many levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was Ram Ramanathan's extraordinary work grounding atmospheric science in the sooty kitchens of Himalayan villagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was Dan Kammen's description of university students' efforts to convince boards of trustees that true fiduciary responsibility transcends a strictly financial calculation of a university's return on investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important merit of the growing focus on climate-related divestment, to my mind, is that it prompts us all more deeply to consider the definition of an institution's &quot;endowment.&quot; Is it stocks and bonds alone or something bigger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of Partha Dasgupta also puts a spotlight on this question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Janice Perlman's work reveals the vitality and potential in those caught up in humanity's astounding high-speed reorganization into a mainly urban species and Juan Grabois's efforts to give a say to those carving an unaccounted living amid that urban rush show that inclusion matters enormously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My personal enthusiasm derives mainly from the work of people like Antonio Battro on expanding educational opportunity with a mix of online tools and novel teaching practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world with 1 billion teenagers and 1 billion more younger children, you can't build schools fast enough, or train teachers fast enough, to keep up. And failing to keep up will lead to unemployability, disaffection, turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Professor Battro noted, the key is expanding basic resources like Internet access - not educational content. In the end, those of us who are professors may be an endangered species. And that can be a good thing, as long as there is equal opportunity for all to become lifelong learners on a planet bathed in information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with alleviating energy poverty, a prime challenge at this moment should be alleviating &quot;information poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some factions will fight this, as is the case in Nigeria, where the Boko Haram extremists, whose very name (the translation is &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;) stands against a basic right, are threatening to sell hundreds of kidnapped schoolgirls into slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's never been a greater chance, through collaboration and communication, to imbue our varied human journeys with a shared sense of priorities - including the importance of conserving Earth's biological bounty, spreading the gifts that come with access to information and safe sources of energy, and limiting the scope of human-driven climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are building the &quot;noosphere,&quot; the &quot;planetary mind&quot; envisioned in the early 20th century by the Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is up to each of us to use this set of tools for good, not just gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what the Passionist priest Father Thomas Berry meant when he wrote of &quot;The Great Work&quot; - &quot;to carry out the transition from a period of human devastation of the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says much that even some of the most accomplished scientists at this meeting articulated that progress on climate, energy, equity, education and conservation of living resources will be driven by values and faith more than data and predictive models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a discussion over dinner, Walter Munk, at 96 one of great oceanographers of modern times, spoke not of gigatons of carbon or megawatts of electricity:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This requires a miracle of love and unselfishness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Disclosure note:&nbsp;My travel costs are being covered by the&nbsp;United Nations Foundation, but there are no constraints on what I write or say.]</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate&nbsp;change has moved from distant threat to present-day danger and no American will be left unscathed, according to a landmark report due to be unveiled tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Climate Assessment, a 1,300-page report compiled by 300 leading scientists and experts, is meant to be the definitive account of the effects of climate&nbsp;change on the US. It will be formally released at a White House event and is expected to drive the remaining two years of Barack Obama's environmental agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are expected to guide Obama as he rolls out the next and most ambitious phase of his climate&nbsp;change plan in June - a proposal to cut emissions from the current generation of power plants, America's largest single source of carbon pollution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House is believed to be organising a number of events over the coming week to give the report greater exposure. &quot;Climate&nbsp;change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,&quot; a draft version of the report says. The evidence is visible everywhere from the top of the atmosphere to the bottom of the ocean, it goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours, though in many regions there are longer dry spells in between.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final wording was under review by the White House but the basic gist remained unchanged, scientists who worked on the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said the world needed to try harder to combat climate&nbsp;change. At a meeting of UN member states in Abu Dhabi before a climate&nbsp;change summit in New York on 23 September, Ban said: &quot;I am asking them to announce bold commitments and actions that will catalyse the transformative change we need. If we do not take urgent action, all our plans for increased global prosperity and security will be undone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report notes that average temperature in the US has increased by about 0.8C (1.5F)since 1895, with more than 80% of that rise since 1980. The last decade was the hottest on record in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temperatures are projected to rise another 2F over the next few decades, the report says. In northern latitudes such as Alaska, temperatures are rising even faster. &quot;There is no question our climate is changing,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois and a lead author of the assessment. &quot;It is changing at a factor of 10 times more than naturally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Record heat - even at night - is expected to produce more drought and fuel larger and more frequent wildfires in the south-west. The north-east, midwest and Great Plains states will see an increase in heavy downpours and a greater risk of flooding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parts of the country are getting wetter, parts are getting drier. All areas are getting hotter,&quot; said Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for global change at the US Geological Survey. &quot;The changes are not the same everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those living on the Atlantic seaboard, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska who have weathered the effects of sea level rise and storm surges can expect to see more. Residents of coastal cities, especially in Florida where there is already frequent flooding during rainstorms, can expect to see more. So can people living in inland cities sited on rivers. Some changes are already having a measurable effect on food production and public health, the report will say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Balbus, senior adviser at the National Institute of Environmental Health Science and a lead author of the NCA report, said rising temperatures increased the risk of heat stroke and heat-related deaths. The assessments are the American equivalent of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC) reports. This year's report for the first time looks at what America has done to fight climate&nbsp;change or protect people in the future. Under an act of Congress the reports were supposed to be produced every four years, but there was no report during George W Bush's presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Razmig Keucheyan: Inequalities are worsening thanks to the environmental crisis. But this injustice may be our most powerful lever for action</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the release of the fifth report by the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate&nbsp;change, calls for the international community to once and for all transcend its divisions and get serious at last about climate&nbsp;change have multiplied. The content of the report is nothing less than frightful: global warming has been occurring since the middle of the 20th century at an unprecedented rate, already engendering all sorts of disasters. No doubt is permitted as to the principal cause of the phenomenon: mankind. This changes everything, to quote the title of Naomi Klein's forthcoming book. Because climate&nbsp;change will affect all of humanity, it renders past conflicts and traditional political categories - left and right among them - obsolete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, this widespread ecological consensus isn't getting us anywhere, and it will certainly not help us fight climate&nbsp;change effectively. The environmental crisis is not brought about by an endless proclivity of mankind to destroy its environment and deplete natural resources, as Jared Diamond, among others, would make us believe in his neo-Malthusian bestsellers. It finds its origin in the logic of a quite recent system, one that was born in the 19th century: industrial capitalism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capitalism is productivist, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">ie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it seeks to increase productivity indefinitely (it has no embedded self-limiting mechanism). Moreover, it is predatory, programmed to exploit and exhaust natural resources and biodiversity. Finally, it is irreparably tied to a carbon - coal, oil and gas - energy system. To use the words of German Marxist Elmar Altvater, industrial capitalism is necessarily fossil capitalism. All three features combine to give way to the dreadful situation described by the IPCC report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is exactly why the environmental crisis doesn't render past conflicts and divisions obsolete, but on the contrary reinforces them. Climate&nbsp;change doesn't change anything, it rather worsens existing problems. To paraphrase a famous dictum by Lenin, it is the highest stage of capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With climate&nbsp;change, a long-standing form of inequality is becoming more and more visible: environmental inequalities. These refer to inequalities that different segments of the population - class, gender, racial groups - experience in their relationship with nature, and more specifically with regard to the effects of climate&nbsp;change. They have existed since the dawn of capitalism. Yet they haven't been as much advertised as other forms of inequalities, especially by the workers' movement. The environmental crisis, as the IPCC report recognises, is rapidly worsening them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental inequalities are manifold: your chances of being exposed to pollutions or toxic waste, for example, are much greater if you belong to the working class, or to a racial minority, whatever the country you live in. Similarly, natural or industrial risks are unequally distributed among the population, since flood-prone areas or neighbourhoods adjacent to chemical plants will typically be cheaper, and hence attract poorer families. Of course, there are exceptions, but the overall picture is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy poverty is a classic example of environmental inequality. In Greece, for instance, to heat an average-sized apartment with fuel will cost around (EURO)1,000 a year. With wood, this figure falls to (EURO)250. The devastating economic crisis that began in 2008 led many Greeks to choose the latter solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, however, has caused a steep increase in illegal cutting of wood, which has accelerated deforestation. At the same time, austerity measures imposed on the country by the European Union forced the government to sack many forest rangers, which facilitated illegal cutting, and hence deforestation. As a consequence of the increase in wood-heating, air pollution in Athens has risen more than 15% since the beginning of the crisis. As is clear from this example, the economic and the environmental crisis are in fact one and the same crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental inequalities not only exist inside countries, but between countries or regions of the world. &quot;Ecological debt&quot; is a notion social movements from the global south have put forward in the past years. By exploiting their natural resources, and hence by durably damaging their environment, industrialised countries owe a huge debt to countries of the south. This ecological debt is much bigger than the financial debt the south supposedly owes the north. Taking it into account would completely transform the way we think about the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sum, if capital is a social relation, as Karl Marx wrote, we should conceive of nature as part of this relation. In addition to class, gender and racial inequalities capitalism generates environmental inequalities. The relationship between these forms of inequalities is complex. Sometimes, two (or more) of them will combine to give way to a particular outcome, say environmental racism, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">ie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the combination of environmental and racial inequality. Environmental racism was denounced by the environmental justice movement in the US at the beginning of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other cases, one sort of inequality will mask another, as in the conflict in Darfur, which is often presented as an ethnic conflict, but is in fact caused - at least in good part - by climate&nbsp;change, as UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has recognised. Under capitalism, inequalities have a cumulative dimension: the more you suffer from one sort of inequality, the greater the chances are you will suffer from another one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intersectionality has been a major theme in contemporary critical theory. It refers to the fact that some individuals or groups, say black women or poor homosexuals, experience multiple forms of domination at once. To the intersection of race, class and gender inequalities, we should now add a fourth dimension: the environment. The climate crisis, no doubt, will increase the weight of this factor in the decades to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this tell us about the fight against climate&nbsp;change? If the IPCC report admits that the environmental crisis will not be felt equally across the population, it didn't push the argument until its logical political conclusion. Because they are concretely experienced in the daily lives of individuals, environmental inequalities represent a powerful lever of mobilisation against climate&nbsp;change. Instead of abstract calls for the international community to act, what should be stressed is the differential impact of the climate crisis on populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence division, not unity, is the key to winning this battle. Using environmental inequalities as a mobilising lever presents the further advantage of bringing the discussion directly to the core of the matter: the productivist, predatory and fossil logic of capitalism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan University and vice-chair of the NCA advisory committee, said the US report would be unequivocal that the effects of climate&nbsp;change were occurring in real-time and were evident in every region of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One major take-home message is that just about every place in the country has observed that the climate has changed,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;It is here and happening, and we are not cherrypicking or fearmongering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report notes that average temperature in the US has increased by about 1.5F (0.8C) since 1895, with more than 80% of that rise since 1980. The last decade was the hottest on record in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temperatures are projected to rise another 2F over the next few decades, the report says. In northern latitudes such as Alaska, temperatures are rising even faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no question our climate is changing,&quot; said Don Wuebbles, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois and a lead author of the assessment. &quot;It is changing at a factor of 10 times more than naturally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Record-breaking heat - even at night - is expected to produce more drought and fuel larger and more frequent wildfires in the south-west, the report says. The north-east, midwest and Great Plains states will see an increase in heavy downpours and a greater risk of flooding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parts of the country are getting wetter, parts are getting drier. All areas are getting hotter,&quot; said Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for global change at the US Geological Survey. &quot;The changes are not the same everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those living on the Atlantic seaboard, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska who have weathered the effects of sea level rise and storm surges can expect to see more. Residents of coastal cities, especially in Florida where there is already frequent flooding during rainstorms, can expect to see more. So can people living in inland cities sited on rivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some changes are already having a measurable effect on food production and public health, the report will say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Balbus, senior adviser at the National Institute of Environmenal Health Science and a lead author of the NCA report, said rising temperatures increased the risk of heat stroke and heat-related deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Takle, convening lead author of the agriculture chapter of the NCA report, and director of the Climate Science programme at Iowa State University, said heatwaves and changes in rainfall had resulted in a levelling off in wheat and corn production and would eventually cause declines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, warmer winters have made it difficult to grow cherries. In the midwest, wetter springs have delayed planting. Invasive vines such as kudzu have spread northward, from the south to the Canadian border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the effects on agriculture, such as a longer growing season, are positive. But Takle said: &quot;By mid-century and beyond the overall impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessments are the American equivalent of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change (IPCC) reports. This year's report for the first time looks at what America has done to fight climate&nbsp;change or protect people from its consequences in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under an act of Congress the reports were supposed to be produced every four years, but no report was produced during George W Bush's presidency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBIA, S.C. -- THIS past winter was a tough one in our backyard. Where we live, about a hundred miles inland from the South Carolina coast, winter is normally a good time to make changes, like the swath of turf I removed from our front yard this year and replaced with perennial flowers and small tufts of native grass. But what is normal now in the garden? One week I'm sweating, the bees are buzzing, buds are breaking; the next, the birdbath is frozen and there's snow on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and again, I found myself translating ominous weather reports into frantic activity. With night falling and my headlamp illuminating specks of wind-driven sleet, I climbed a ladder to bundle frost cloth around fruit trees in bloom, then heaped pine straw mulch over tender sprigs of new growth on our native rabbiteye blueberries, trying to save our garden from the polar vortex. One frigid evening, I fell into a kind of horticultural despair. What's the point? I harrumphed, stepping down from my ladder. Anything worth saving will survive on its own.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do we garden in a time of climate&nbsp;change? It seemed to me that everything I knew about gardening, and much of what I enjoyed, was based on a set of assumptions about the climate. But it's different now. We have to figure out how to garden with the new seasons, such as they are. Extreme gardening for an extreme climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just beginning to figure out the practical implications of this adaptive approach, but the point seems pretty clear to me: keeping things alive that won't make it otherwise. Climate&nbsp;change is going to force us to work hard at something Homo sapiens has never been very good at: keeping other species around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An urban garden like my family's is a good place to start. It's the kind of place that already bears little resemblance to what might have existed before humans came along. Nearby parking lots absorb heat, while buildings cast shade, moderating temperature swings. Water flows along curbs and down drains. Even the soil is different; concrete sidewalks neutralize acidity, encouraging plants that wouldn't grow here otherwise. New communities of species arise in these conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One study conducted in Davis, Calif., found that 29 of 32 native butterflies in that city breed on nonnative plants. Thirteen of these butterfly species have no native host plants in the city; they persist there because nonnative plants support them. If we are seeking lessons about ecological resilience in a time of deep and unsettling change, the place to look is right outside our door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this microenvironment, extreme gardening means making the yard hospitable for as many species as possible, without worrying so much about whether they originally belonged here or not. I used to think that tearing out turf and making room for native species like purple coneflower and switchgrass was the best thing I could do. But things aren't that simple anymore. It doesn't make sense to think in terms of native and nonnative when the local weather vacillates so abruptly. A resilient garden is a diverse garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already face the peculiar irony of species that are disappearing across their native range but flourishing outside it, like the European rabbit, which is in trouble in its native habitat on the Iberian Peninsula of Spain and Portugal, but considered a pest in Australia. The peregrine falcon, which disappeared from the rugged cliffs of the eastern United States in the mid-1960s because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, is thriving today partly because of its affinity for nesting on bridges and buildings in our cities. This phenomenon of species movement and adaptation is likely to become commonplace as the climate&nbsp;changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating a resilient garden means paying attention to the life histories of individual species and how they interact with others in the community. What benefits, like nectar or shelter, do they provide? Are they likely to crowd out other species? What kind of help do they need from us to withstand wild fluctuations in temperature? A gardener who asks these kinds of questions mixes things up, leaving some parts of the yard untouched while weeding and enriching the soil in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldenrod is a good example in our yard. A native species, it appeared spontaneously one spring. I let it go, and within two years its six-foot stems were shading out all the other plantings in our yard. Purple coneflowers, blackberries, muhly grass, a persimmon sapling -- anything that craved sunshine cowered under the dominion of goldenrod. This wasn't all bad; the flowers sagged with bees and the pithy dead stems harbored wintering insects. But I envision our yard as the kind of place where if an insect doesn't happen to like goldenrod, or happens to be searching for pollen and nectar when the goldenrod isn't in bloom, there are still plenty of options. And so I chopped it down and dug out quite a bit of goldenrod, which still left plenty behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fostering this localized diversity doesn't mean ignoring what is happening outside our own neighborhood. In fact, we can shape our yards to help address these bigger issues. There's a hot, sandy patch in front of our house that I've reserved for introducing sandhill milkweed, a favorite host for monarch butterflies as they migrate across our state. I feel a special affinity for monarchs, since they're being hammered by extreme weather. Three times in the last decade, unusually heavy rain and deep frost have hit populations of monarchs wintering in the high-altitude conifer forests of Mexico, wiping out 50 to 80 percent of the flocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've never seen this species of milkweed growing in our neighborhood. It's not particularly showy, like some of its cousins, but for the butterflies' sake I'm hopeful it can adapt to our local conditions. Our yard is, after all, a sandy remnant of a prehistoric coastline, back when the climate was warmer and the ocean was right here, a hundred miles inland from where it is now. The soil in our yard is a reminder that things can change, fundamentally, and life can adapt. Unlike those previous episodes, however, we humans are responsible for the current changes. So we must also be responsible for helping other species survive them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken alone, the small-scale transformation in my yard doesn't matter all that much. But a constellation of small patches of milkweed, connecting one neighborhood to the next, might mean the difference between life and death for the monarchs. We need to start thinking not just about what used to be, but what could be. It's going to take a lot of work. But it sure beats despair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dana Nuccitelli: Murdoch's The Australian simultaneously denies that global warming is happening, it's our fault, and it's a problem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've previously written about the five stages of climate denial. Climate contrarians were exhibiting all five stages leading up to the release of the latest IPCC report in ideologically biased media outlets like Rupert Murdoch's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Australian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, John Cook (himself an Australian, at the University of Queensland) proposed the Quantum Theory of Climate Denial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are various states of climate denial, with some states contradicting others. For example, some believe global warming is not happening. Others believe global warming is happening but is not caused by humans. Others believe humans are causing global warming but that the impacts won't be bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, it's perfectly understandable for a community of people to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs. But can one person hold three inconsistent beliefs at the same time? Can a person argue that global warming is not happening, then smoothly transition to arguing that global warming is happening but is caused by something else?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can, and they do ... It can be explained by the &quot;quantum theory of climate denial.&quot; This theory holds that climate deniers exist in a fuzzy quantum state of denial, simultaneously rejecting many or all aspects of climate science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychologically this can be easily explained, because climate denial is based not on science, but rather on ideology. This denial is caused by a desire to maintain the status quo and/or an opposition to the policies needed to solve the climate problem. Pseudoscientific arguments are only needed as a means to justify those ideological positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the problem doesn't exist, or if it's not our fault, or if it's nothing to worry about, then we can maintain the status quo. Any of these arguments will suffice to justify opposition to climate solutions, so even though they're contradictory, those who deny climate realities for ideological reasons can deploy any of these positions at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdoch's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Australian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a prime example, having in recent months run stories claiming that global warming isn't happening, is happening but isn't due to carbon dioxide emissions, and is happening, is due to carbon dioxide, but isn't anything to worry about. Two of those articles were written by Bjorn Lomborg, a favorite of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Australian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Just a few days ago, the newspaper published another Lomborg piece, this one blaming virtually all of the world's problems on renewable energy. Fossil fuels are lovely -&nbsp;status quo it is!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial was full of misleading, unsubstantiated arguments. In essence, 'renewable energy is too expensive and receives too many subsidies, whereas fossil fuels are great for the poor because they're cheap.' Just look at China, suggests Lomborg - if you can see it through the smog-filled air that's causing 1.2 million premature deaths per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial complained about the billions of dollars in wind and solar energy subsidies, neglecting the approximately $1.5 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies. It claimed that high energy prices are worse for people in poor countries than global warming impacts. Yet a report from Lomborg's own organization found that climate&nbsp;change has already been hurting the economies of poorer nations for many decades. Those countries happen to be the most vulnerable to climate damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial also complained that Australia's carbon tax has caused energy prices to rise, making it difficult for low-income households to pay their energy bills. The solution to that problem is a simple one - make the tax revenue neutral. While energy prices will still rise in that scenario, the costs to households will be offset when the resulting revenue is returned to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its state of quantum climate denial, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Australian</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is happy to swallow Lomborg's flawed economics arguments, or take any other position that justifies the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quantum theory of climate denial extends far beyond Australia of course. Media outlets, politicians, and others in the US and UK can also often be found to inhabit multiple seemingly contradictory climate positions at the same time. However, given that an ideological opposition to climate solutions seems to be the basis for this denial, it would be nice if we could all move beyond arguing about well-established science and instead debate about climate policies. After all, if we're all honest with ourselves, the climate 'debate' isn't about science at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Open Source Seed Initiative aims to provide an alternative to the patent-protected seeds sold by major producers such as Monsanto and DuPont</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By trade, Jack Kloppenburg is a sociologist and a professor at the University of Wisconsin. Lately, however, his job has entailed packaging seeds and mailing them to farmers, in addition to his normal teaching and grading duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This change in routine was prompted by the unexpected popularity of the recently launched Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) a project spearheaded by Kloppenburg and Wisconsin horticulture professor Irwin Goldman. In mid-April, the initiative released 36 seed varieties, all free from the patent restrictions that limit much of the seed commercially available today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing went viral and it's all over the place now,&quot; Kloppenburg said. &quot;We got 230 orders from eight countries, when we hadn't even anticipated selling any seed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative's goal is to provide an alternative to the patent-protected seeds sold by major producers such as Monsanto and DuPont, most of which require buyers to sign agreements that create strict limits on how the seed can be used. Farmers are generally prohibited from saving seed from their crops to plant the following year, for example; new seeds must be purchased for each planting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seed giants like Monsanto argue that this approach encourages innovation by allowing companies to protect the investment of time and money they put into developing new plant varieties. Kloppenburg and his OSSI partners, however, find the practice unsettling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are using intellectual property rights, especially patents, to separate farmers from a fundamental means of production,&quot; he said. &quot;Control of the seed is, in many ways, control over the entire food supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the concentration of the industry into a few big players - just three companies sell more than half the seeds on the market, according to the Center for Food Safety - means that the biological diversity of crops is declining, making our food supply less likely to adapt well to climate change, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking for solutions to these concerns, OSSI drew inspiration from the open-source software movement, which creates computer code available to anyone to study, modify, or distribute. Much open-source software is regulated by legally binding licenses that give users wide latitude to alter and even commercialize the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To adapt the open source concept to seeds, OSSI decided to use a less formal pledge rather than a licensing system. Each packet of OSSI seeds sold will be printed with a statement that reads, in part, &quot;By opening this packet, you pledge that you will not restrict others' use of these seeds and their derivatives by patents, licenses, or any other means. You pledge that if you transfer these seeds or their derivatives you will acknowledge the source of these seeds and accompany your transfer with this pledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the pledge does not allow OSSI to take violators to court, Kloppenburg feels that this less restrictive approach is more within the spirit of the project, he said. He hopes the pledge will kickstart a movement toward seeds unrestricted by patents and legal agreements; he can, he said, imagine a day when &quot;open-source seed&quot; is a term used to attract sustainability-conscious shoppers in the way the organic label does today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to be police,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to make free seed a sort of meme, to raise people's consciousness and awareness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without legal protections keeping open-source seeds from being patented, however, OSSI's approach is unlikely to solve the long-term problems, said Tom Stearns, founder of partner company High Mowing Organic Seeds. The company contributed just one seed to the recent release so that it can start small and assess how the open-source pledge actually functions in the market, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is a great start, but I don't think it's nearly enough,&quot; Stearns said. &quot;This is one attempt that I hope will be the beginning of many conversations and many attempts to address the intellectual property challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OSSI plans to incorporate as a nonprofit organization, but partners and customers are free to use the open-source seeds to make money, as long as they don't patent any of their developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first round of seeds released includes quinoa, peppers, and squash developed by Wild Garden Seed in Oregon, lettuce and kale from Lupine Knoll Farm in Oregon, carrots bred by Goldman, and spelt from High Mowing Organic Seeds in Vermont. Currently, the initiative is selling sample packs of 15 seeds for $25 each, but the plan is eventually to link to individual partner breeders through the site, so customers can buy directly, Kloppenburg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not necessarily in it to make as much money as we can,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to generate new options.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-eight years after Unit 4 at the Chernobyl power plant in what was then Soviet Ukraine erupted into a volcano of radioactivity, its name has become synonymous with the nightmarish side of nuclear power. It is also the site today of an extraordinary international project, the construction of a vast steel shield to cover the leaky concrete ''sarcophagus'' in which the highly radioactive remains of the reactor are entombed, and do so for at least 100 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of what is called the New Safe Confinement by an international team of engineers and workers is already almost a decade behind schedule, and current plans call for it to be completed by 2017. Given the decrepit state of the sarcophagus, it is a race against time. Add to that the uncertainty and near-bankruptcy of Ukraine, and Chernobyl continues to stand as a fearsome testament to the dangers of nuclear power -- more powerful than Three Mile Island before it or Fukushima after it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it is also noteworthy that these civilian nuclear disasters did not and have not overcome the allure of nuclear power as a source of clean and abundant energy. Only Germany succumbed to panic after the Fukushima disaster and began to phase out all nuclear power in favor of huge investments in renewable sources like wind and sun. One consequence has been at least a temporary increase in greenhouse emissions as Germany has been forced to fire up old coal- and gas-powered plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dangers of nuclear power are real, but the accidents that have occurred, even Chernobyl, do not compare to the damage to the earth being inflicted by the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, gas and oil. The latest dire warning from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change should leave no doubt that reducing carbon emissions must be an urgent priority and that nuclear energy must be part of the mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It leaves no doubt, either, that the world must do what it can to increase energy efficiency and harness sun, wind, ocean currents and other renewable sources to meet our ever-expanding needs for energy. But the time when these can replace all fossil and nuclear fuels is still far off, and in the meantime nuclear energy remains an important means of generating electricity without adding to the steadily increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much the same reason, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an independent group formerly known as the Pew Center on Global Climate&nbsp;Change, urged policy makers this week to pay attention to the withering away of America's fleet of 100 nuclear reactors. In the past year and a half, four power companies have announced the early retirement of five nuclear reactors, which supplied 4.2 percent of America's total nuclear generating capacity. Two are in California and one each in Florida, Wisconsin and Vermont. Another company is considering closing as many as three financially struggling reactors in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for the shutdowns vary. In some cases, competition from cheap natural gas and from nearby wind farms has forced reactors to operate at a loss. In other cases, a marginal plant's economic viability has been jeopardized by the cost of replacing steam generators to extend the life of a plant or by the cost of upgrading safety systems to meet new requirements imposed after the disaster in Fukushima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reasons, these sobering trends, if left unattended, will make it harder for the United States to meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The center notes that since 1990 nuclear power has consistently supplied about one-fifth of the nation's electricity and more than 60 percent of all zero-carbon electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The watchword here and in the world at large should be prudence. Prudence in the design, maintenance and operation of all nuclear facilities. Prudence also in the sense that policy makers not be spooked into shutting down a vital source of clean energy in a warming world. The great shield over Chernobyl should also entomb unfounded fears of using nuclear power in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The federal government will build its first gasoline storage reserves in the New York Harbor area and in New England in response to the shortages suffered after Hurricane Sandy, the secretary of energy, Ernest J. Moniz, is to announce on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, the reserves will hold about a million barrels of gasoline and cost about $215 million. The fuel is intended to be held back in case another disaster cripples regional fuel supplies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Department officials envision the reserves as the first in a series that will be built in parts of the country vulnerable to extreme weather, believed to be caused by global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In addition to our mitigation and international efforts, the president's Climate Action Plan calls on us to take measures today in order to better prepare for the effects of climate&nbsp;change we already see occurring here at home,'' Mr. Moniz said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuel shortages were one of the most widespread problems after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Two New York-area fuel refineries were shut down, and hundreds of gas stations lost power, leading to severe gasoline shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some New York gas stations were without fuel for as long as 30 days. In addition, 25 of the region's 127 fuel terminals -- which hold gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel supplies that are delivered by pipeline, ship or local refinery -- were shut down. The Pentagon eventually delivered 24 million gallons of fuel to the storm-ravaged region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I remember those horrible days after Sandy, when people couldn't get gasoline,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an interview. ''It was pouring salt in the wound. People needed food, heat; they needed the barest necessities. But the public transportation was knocked out. If you didn't have gasoline for a car, you were shorn from the basic necessities. It prolonged the pain of Sandy for almost a month.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schumer said he had asked the Energy Department to look into ways to prevent such disruptions. ''Repairing the old wasn't good enough,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''You have to prepare for the future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regional storage reserves are modeled on a national one, an emergency supply of about 700 million barrels of crude oil stored in salt domes along the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government built those reserves after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, with the intent of tapping them in the case of a disruption to the nation's oil supply. Presidents have ordered that those reserves be opened on three occasions: during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and in 2011 during the Arab Spring unrest in North Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government sold five million barrels of that oil; officials said the money from the sale would go toward building the regional gasoline reserves in the Northeast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials said the challenges presented by climate&nbsp;change can make it hard to quickly move fuel to areas affected by weather -- particularly since storms can severely damage oil pipelines and refineries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2013 Energy Department report concluded that the nation's energy supply system was vulnerable to increasingly severe and costly weather events driven by climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It concluded that the blackouts and other energy disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy were just a taste of what was to come, and said that every element of the nation's energy infrastructure -- oil wells, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants -- would be threatened by intense storms, rising seas, higher temperatures and frequent droughts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;At the Pope&amp;#8217;s science academy, an unfolding discussion of the role of science and ethics in shaping the human journey. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VATICAN CITY - &quot;Birth control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those words were uttered on Friday just 99 minutes into a novel four-day meeting of scientists, theologians, economists and other analysts convened at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences here. The phrase - not heard often in these halls - was just one of many signs of the free-wheeling nature of discussions that unfolded in hopes of charting fresh paths toward durable human advancement on a finite planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers said the workshop, &quot;Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Planet, Our Responsibility,&quot; is largely aimed at bringing together disciplines and ideologies that rarely intersect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants range from Walter Munk, a 96-year-old marine researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., to Juan Grabois, an Argentinian in his 30s who is a lawyer and organizer of street vendors, waste pickers and other marginalized workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presentations, nearly all of which are online, are focused on food, health and energy, but also on the value of slowing climate&nbsp;change and conserving the planet's biological bounty, called by some participants &quot;natural capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In introductory remarks, Margaret S. Archer, a sociologist who is president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is co-hosting the talks with the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, said her hope was that the interplay of points of view and specialties would identify new research opportunities and inspire lasting collaborations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What she did not want, she stressed, was the kind of atmosphere seen at village dances, at which the &quot;girls line up on one side, the boys on the other&quot; and they only meet glancingly before going their separate ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 10 hours, a host of views were expressed, ranging from a hopeful picture of demographic trends from G&eacute;rard-Fran&ccedil;ois Dumont of the University of Paris to an urgent call for action to avoid crossing dangerous planetary boundaries from Jeffrey D. Sachs of Columbia University's Earth Institute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one had a free ride. You can sift part of Friday's 10-hour session on YouTube here. Particularly interesting was a prolonged discussion following Sachs's talk, which focused on the United Nations push to develop a set of Sustainable Development Goals to succeed the Millennium Development Goals expiring next year. (Scroll to the spot on the video around 8:08:00 for his talk and the discussion. Sachs's slides are here.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even within disciplines, there was a constructive search for clarity. After Sachs spoke of the importance of fostering a &quot;global ethics,&quot; Stefano Zamagni, an economics professor at the University of Bologna, cautioned that it was important to qualify such statements. &quot;When we talk about ethics we mean different things,&quot; he said, rattling off a list of ethical frames ranging from utilitarian to neo-contractualist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most profound phrases came first thing in the morning, in a wise and impassioned speech by Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, a close adviser to Pope Francis:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays man finds himself to be a technical giant and an ethical child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Of course I'm exhibiting confirmation bias in highlighting this line, given how it resonates with my notion that we're essentially going through &quot;puberty on the scale of a planet.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage you to read his full speech, but here's another excerpt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Built on consumerism and the rapid augmentation of profits, progress in our post-industrial age has led to serious environmental imbalances in the most comprehensive sense of the term: an over-consumption of non-renewable raw materials, noise, visual and air pollution, and the extinction of animal and vegetable species. It has also brought about profound social and economic imbalances: a wealthy Northern Hemisphere where a poverty-stricken Fourth World has emerged, a Southern Hemisphere riddled with deprivation and misery, and forced emigration. In addition, our world is currently the sad witness of energy crises and speculation, of health disorders caused by the overabundance of food in some places and by famine elsewhere, and of old diseases in a new form as a result of antibiotic-resistant microbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt man's life on Earth has been riddled with ordeals, which&nbsp;explains his aggressiveness and his drive for domination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of a difficult and hostile world, more and more sophisticated techniques have been created to domesticate it and make it inhabitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But technical advancements have progressed so much that it already seems as if we were living in an artificial world. Thus a sort of &quot;supra-nature&quot; has been created, which has partly helped man, but which has also detached him from Mother Nature. Both history and our current existence show that our &quot;software&quot; - i.e., our ideas and values - has evolved much more slowly than our &quot;hardware&quot;, which has focused for centuries on maximum growth and productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Misleh, the director of the Catholic Coalition on Climate&nbsp;Change, provided a useful summary of the day on his blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been invited to offer a brief summary of the workshop's most resonant themes at the end of the final day, May 6. If the first day was any indication, I've got my work cut out for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll be trying to convey interesting points along the way using the Twitter hashtag #sustvatican. Keep track or weigh in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: GDP stats reveal same brand of unsustainable debt-led growth behind worst financial crisis since Great Depression</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Meadway, a former UK government policy adviser at the Treasury, has criticised Chancellor George Osborne's claim that newly released GDP figures prove &quot;Britain is coming back.&quot; He argues that the government's relentless pursuit of stringent austerity and expansion of household debt is reinforcing the risk of a major economic crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (Nef) in London, Meadway argues that the policies driving UK growth arefatally flawed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are setting up... exactly the conditions that helped produce the crash of 2008: debt-led growth, in which stagnant or falling real earnings are masked by increasing levels of household debt that sustain continued consumer spending.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the 0.8% increase in growth over the last quarter, current performance indicates that manufacturing output &quot;will not recover to its 2008 level before 2019.&quot; With average earnings rising at a rate of 1.4%, and the Consumer Price Index's inflation figures ignoring the large cost of housing at around 40% of household income, real inflation &quot;is now running at 2.5% a year, well ahead of increases in earnings...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fall in real earnings since 2008 is the longest sustained decline in most people's living standards since the 1870s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation is likely to continue. As the government's Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts, real earnings will fall &quot;virtually every year until 2018.&quot; The fall in real earnings has accompaniedincreasing inequality, impacting detrimentally on health, well-being and crime rates. Data from the European Quality of Life Survey finds that between 2007 and 2011, the well-being of the richest quarter of Britons rose, while dropping for the poorest quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, while real earnings are falling, household spending has experienced &quot;the fastest rate of growth since 2007&quot; - sustained by &quot;falling savings and a return to borrowing.&quot; This has fuelled a London-centric property bubble that favours the wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With levels of UK public sector debt topping &pound;1.2 trillion, Osborne has borrowed more in the last 5 years than Labour did throughout its 13 years in government, having left Britain at $0.8 trillion in debt. At the end of last year, outstanding personal UK debt stood at &pound;1.4 trillion, and outstanding mortgage debt at &pound;1.3 trillion. Total household debt is predicted to increase to &pound;2.2 trillion by 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, Meadway told me, is that as with the 2008 banking collapse:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The danger of another crash certainly increases the more debt is being created. It looks like, at present, that the UK's household sector could become the weak link in all this - if earnings do not pick up, the sheer mass of accumulated debt, with the need to service (to repay and pay interest) could start to present problems. So if the recovery follows its current course, the possibility of such a domestically-generated crash will rise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new report by economist Dr Jo Michell of the University of the West of England's Bristol Business School, projections using the Cambridge Alphametrics macro-economic policy model (CAM) show that &quot;this growth strategy cannot be sustained.&quot; The misnamed 'recovery' is merely &quot;a return to the debt-led and consumption-driven growth of the pre-crisis era...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government appears determined to press ahead with a policy programme designed to reproduce and reinforce the imbalances which proved so deadly in 2008. But [Osborne's] reliance on the indebtedness of the household sector to maintain GDP growth rates is fundamentally unsustainable. One way or another, the current trajectory will come to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is compounded by looming energy challenges. Since 2010, UK household energy bills have risen by 40%, a trend that is likely to continue under the government's current energy policies focusing on shale gas. &quot;North Sea gas has depleted far faster than was bargained for in the early 1990s, and Norwegian supplies are also under severe pressure,&quot; said Meadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reuters research has suggested that we will start having to import from Russia in 2015 - indeed, we already buy 40% of our coal for electricity production from Russian sources. Fracking, as Lord Browne has acknowledged, is unlikely to produce reductions in fuel bills, since unlike the US the gas price here is set by conditions on the European market, not production conditions in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of energy crisis in sparking recession is ignored by conventional economic models. However, American economist Prof James Hamilton of the University of California has modelled the link between oil prices and US recessions - including the 2008 crash - in a study for the US Congressional Joint Economic Committee. Prof Hamilton concluded that the collapse of the housing bubble was triggered by the post-2005 oil price shocks which escalated cost of living and induced sweeping consumer debt-defaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the views of oil industry insiders like Jeremy Leggett are correct - who says that as industry reserve estimates are being systematically exaggerated we could face the risk of a major oil crash over the next five to six years - then the UK's unsustainable growth trajectory could unravel sooner rather than later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern that continued dependence on fossil fuels could derail the economy is supported by a report from the UK Energy Research Centre released yesterday. The report states that the government's apparent insistence on &quot;scaling back the UK's low carbon ambitions&quot; would prolong &quot;the exposure of consumers and the UK economy to the potential impacts of high fossil fuel prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, this is only one factor among many ignored by the government's economic modelling on climate policy. A newpeer-reviewed report by Harvard economist Dr Frank Ackerman and energy consultant Joseph Daniel, commissioned by Friends of the Earth and the World Wildlife Fund, exposes how the Treasury's slanted 'Computable General Equilibrium' (CGE) model systematically underestimates the economic gains, health benefits and job-creation potential of a low carbon transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An approach that ignores all these benefits - as the HMRC CGE model does - is sure to misunderstand the real economics of climate policy,&quot; said Ackerman. &quot;A person who chooses to wear a blindfold will often report that there is nothing to see, but this tells us more about the viewer than his surroundings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, Friends of the Earth economics campaigner David Powell questioned the usefulness of GDP as a meaningful measure of economic success:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's assume climate&nbsp;change is real and it's a problem - and that we either get fossil fuels out of our economy, or we burn them with abandon and suffer crippling social and economic side effects. Either way, growth in the future is going to have to mean something qualitatively different: growth in what? Future generations may well consider it borderline barbaric to have put slivers of GDP here or there today, above a genuinely healthy economy for the long haul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked ex-Treasury adviser James Meadway what, if anything, could be done to achieve a healthier economy. He suggested three key strategies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;End austerity, both to end its social impact and to support local demand; break up the major banks, setting up accountable regional and local institutions with clear mandates to provide socially responsible credit; and invest heavily in green infrastructure, including the promotion of community-owned wind farms, micro-hydro, and other renewable energy projects, along with a German-style home insulation scheme. What you're aiming for is to set up robust local and regional economies that do not depend on the Westminster-City hub to sustain themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dame Helen Ghosh, director-general of the National Trust, is no stranger to media storms. In 2012, after quitting as permanent secretary at the Home Office she reportedly criticised the lack of women in David Cameron's government, although she later denied this. Last year, after joining the trust she caused controversy with an interview in the Times that suggested she was pro-fracking, as well as anti-wind farms. She said its selective quotes gave a false impression of where the trust stands on these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we on principle oppose all wind farms? No we don't. There's a right place for them but not on or near our land,&quot; Ghosh now says. &quot;Almost by definition the land and property we own are special, otherwise we wouldn't own them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And would she now allow fracking on National Trust land? &quot;No, because we don't believe anyone understands the environmental impacts,&quot; she says. &quot;And because we as far as possible would want to avoid anything that encourages the continued use of fossil fuels.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that's a categorical no to fracking, then? &quot;At some imaginary point in future, if all those (environmental) concerns were in some way met, it's possible, but at the moment the answer would absolutely be no,&quot; she reiterates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghosh's latest views follow the announcement last week that the trust will start generating power from a hydroelectric turbine in Snowdonia in its first large-scale renewables project. It has more than 250 smaller projects, including solar panels on stately homes, aiming to halve its fossil fuel use by 2020, despite still rejecting wind farms on or near its land, though it has the odd wind turbine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If bits of your land are falling into the sea, you're quite concerned about climate&nbsp;change and its effect,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of her comments on women in government, all Ghosh will say is that &quot;one day there will be a female cabinet secretary&quot;. But she clearly looks back with nostalgia to a time when she was one of a number of female permanent secretaries in Whitehall. &quot;There was that wonderful moment when Gus O'Donnell was cabinet secretary, when I think half of the big departments were run by women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in stark contrast to the dearth of women now in the senior ranks of the civil service. She believes, however, that this is a temporary, rather than an intrinsic problem because until recently, the &quot;blockage&quot; may have been the absence of senior women in the Treasury, No 10 or the Cabinet Office. &quot;That provides a pipeline to the next level, which is why it's good to see some senior women in those places,&quot; she says, citing Sharon White (recently appointed second permanent secretary to the Treasury) and Melanie Dawes (in the Cabinet Office). &quot;It just so happens that intermediately there aren't quite enough women in the right place. I don't think it's a conspiracy, I don't think it has anything to do with ministerial preference, I just think it's just to do with having the people already there,&quot; says Ghosh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She attributes her success in the civil service as being in &quot;the right place at the right time with the right set of experiences&quot; and says she left (despite being tipped as the first woman cabinet secretary) because she had always wanted to try her hand at running a non-governmental organisation (NGO). &quot;One of my heroes was Martin Narey, who left the Prison Service and went off to lead Barnado's. I looked at him and thought wow, what a fabulous thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghosh claims her time as a young civil servant in the Department of the Environment gave her a taste for partnership working. &quot;All this led me to think I can equally affect society and people's experiences of life from an NGO angle as from within government. And I just wanted to try something new. Self-reinvention I suppose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the National Trust, Ghosh wants to address the widely held perception of the charity as staunchly middle class - all stately homes and teas. &quot;It's not true. Last year, we had 20m visits to historic houses and we had 200m visits to our countryside. If you ever stand in one of those car parks and chat to people as they walk along, that's a very varied population. That's by no means just the middle classes. That's a very wide range of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we do worry that the growth in our visits is more in the outdoors - parkland and countryside - than our houses. A number of people still find our houses irrelevant to their lives, despite everything that we've done on welcoming, presenting things in a more relaxed way, taking down the ropes and allowing people to sit down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say 'here's a leaflet, you can go into the house, no one will talk to you if you don't want them to, you can go for half an hour - it won't take you two hours. Here are just six wonderful things you can see if you go in.' We need to be much more flexible about making it easy to enjoy those sorts of places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghosh is particularly passionate when talking about climate&nbsp;change. She estimates that the trust suffered &pound;2m worth of damage caused by the recent floods, from fallen trees to bits of the coastline falling into the sea. So what is the trust doing to prevent future floods?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It isn't just a matter of dredging, though in some places it can be important, and it isn't just a matter of building the flood defences higher, it's a matter of thinking about working with farmers to create more flood plains,&quot; she says, citing projects in Somerset and the Lake District where the trust is putting back meanders into rivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On coastal erosion, the trust is starting to purchase inland from the coast, as well as endangered coastline. It's a pragmatic decision &quot;so when the coastal path disappears, we've got access and still have a coastal path,&quot; she explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghosh is worried that the government's planning policy fails to protect green spaces. Although she says there was &quot;some movement&quot; when the coalition strengthened incentives for building on brownfield land, she concedes that she is still concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think local authorities have been hustled into producing their development plans. It's meant they've put significant plans for building houses on the green belt and we worry about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the heart of our belief, people need green spaces. That's why the green belt is so important to people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to what extent should the trust, given its 4 million membership - making it bigger then the three main political parties combined - actively campaign on issues such as planning and climate&nbsp;change? After all, it was founded in 1895 by three passionate Victorians, including the social reformer, Octavia Hill, who wanted to preserve outdoor spaces and prevent them from being built on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 70% of members, it's a transactional relationship, for the rest, the National Trust is a cause, says Ghosh. She believes it should only conduct campaigns &quot;occasionally&quot;, otherwise it will lose impact and the support of members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fundamentally we've got to get the nation to love the things we love. We then need to be engaged in policy debates, not become a major campaigning organisation but focus our efforts on the things that will really make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly half of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to an American Lung Association (ALA) report released Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 148 million people live in areas where smog and soot particles make it unhealthy to breathe the air, according to the ALA's annual study on US air quality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, which is based on data collected between 2010 and 2012, found smog, or ozone, had worsened in 22 of the 25 biggest US metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Houston, Washington-Baltimore, New York City and Chicago - and said there was a high risk of more high-ozone days because of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weather played a factor,&quot; the report said. &quot;The warmer summers in 2010 and 2012 contributed to higher ozone readings and more frequent ozone days. Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smog, or ozone, which is the most widespread air pollutant, forms more readily in hotter temperatures, and is expected to increase under climate&nbsp;change. &quot;It's going to make it harder to clean up air pollution,&quot; said Janice Nolen of the ALA. &quot;Days that wouldn't ordinarily have high ozone levels are going to have them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;It's going to be much harder to keep ozone pollution down to the levels that we should be breathing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is growing concern globally - including in the US - about the health risks of air pollution. The report's release comes a day after the supreme court endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to deal with smog and soot that travel across state lines. The ALA had joined that case on behalf of the EPA. The group has also been pushing hard to tighten air pollution standards, and has supported the EPA's moves to force power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientific research shows that smog and soot are far more harmful at lower levels than previously thought. A growing body of research over the last decade has connected air pollution to increased deaths from heart disease and respiratory illnesses. The World Health Organisation said last autumn that particulate pollution causes lung cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air pollution in New Delhi rose to record levels in winter, triggering a debate about whether the Indian capital had now caught up with Beijing. Britain was on smog alert earlier this month after recording very high levels of air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, California's pollution control officers warned this month that extreme heat and wildfires could set back decades of improvements in air quality, boosting smog formation and spewing dangerous smoke into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen of the 25 US cities with the worst particulate pollution saw a drop in year-round particle pollutants because of cuts in emissions for coal-fired power plants and other measures. Thirteen of them, including Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Atlanta, registered their lowest ever levels. But the report said those cities still failed to meet national standards for year-round particle pollution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Abraham: Bob Ward has identified several errors in Richard Tol's IPCC economics chapter, but the economic need for action is clear</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have frequently criticized flawed analyses from economists or political scientists regarding climate&nbsp;change and its impacts. An excellent recent criticism was written by Bob Ward from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate&nbsp;Change and the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward has been in a public battle to achieve corrections relating to the work of economics professor Richard Tol. Richard Tol is at the University of Sussex; he is well-known in the climate circles as someone who has been a proponent arguing for potential benefits from modest climate&nbsp;change to society and economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in October 2013, Ward reviewed Tol's work after it was publicly cited by Matt Ridley in the Spectator. I had also criticized Matt Ridley's writings as not representing the views of the scientific community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward's findings were striking. He reported,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Viscount Ridley drew primarily on an academic paper by Professor Tol which was published in the 'Journal of Economic Perspectives'. The study drew together a number of estimates of the aggregate economic impacts of climate&nbsp;change and concluded that global warming of up to 2.2&deg;C would have a net beneficial impact for the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when I examined Tol's paper in detail, I discovered that he had made a number of errors, wrongly plotting studies which had found net negative impacts as if they were positive benefits. Of the 14 data listed in Table 1 and plotted in Figure 1 of the paper, at least four were wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you put all of these mistakes together, there was only one of Tol's studies that showed a significant positive impact from climate&nbsp;change. That study, published in 2002 suggested a 2.3% effect on global wealth with a 1&deg;C temperature rise. Even there however, Tol admitted that many impacts of climate&nbsp;change were omitted which will change the results. When I challenged Professor Tol on this point, he identified a second paper which showed a very small potential positive economic impact of 0.1% as climate&nbsp;change progresses, which I think we can agree is not significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">exchanged email with Professor Tol to confirm that his 2009 paper contained mistakes, but he refused to give any undertaking to write to the journal to correct them</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; Ward wrote,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I then decided to check some of the other analyses that Professor Tol had published on the economic impacts. Sure enough, I found some of the same mistakes in a paper published in 2012 in 'Environmental and Resource Economics' and in 2013 in the 'Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward found that Tol made multiple errors in his 2013 publication. In the end, it was still only Tol's own work which showed significant economic benefits with climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2014, Ward extended his investigation to a leaked version of the final draft of the IPCC Working Group 2 report. There, chapter 10 had a section which was largely based on Tol's own work. This material had not appeared in previous drafts of the report and so had not been made available to expert reviewers of the report, like Ward. The final draft contained multiple errors in Table 10.B.1 and in Figure 10-1; some of which stemmed from the Tol 2013 article. And there was still only the Tol study that showed significant positive impacts, yet the text of chapter 10 stated that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth) but disagree on the sign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Ward wrote to Professor Tol, authors of the IPCC report, and editors of the journals where the errors had appeared to seek corrections. He also asked the journal editors to make available the calculations used by Tol for his papers, so that the rest of the results could be checked for further inaccuracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ward recounted in a commentary,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disappointingly, none of the journals have so far secured an agreement from Professor Tol to make his calculations available, which means that a number of the data included in Chapter 10 of the IPCC report remain unverifiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, I remain concerned about the following statement from the Summary for Policymakers from the report: &quot;the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2&deg;C are between 0.2 and 2% of income (&plusmn;1 standard deviation around the mean)&quot;. These figures are drawn entirely from Professor Tol's 2013 paper, and without independent verification of the data currently being possible, I do not regard them to have been proven robust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the version of Chapter 10 that has been published on the IPCC's website is the draft that was distributed to governments in October 2013, and still contains at least three erroneous data points in Table 10.B.1 and Figure 10-1. The text of Section 10.9.2 remains a highly misleading description of the data: &quot;Estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth) but disagree on the sign&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I indicated earlier, I wrote to Richard Tol and put some of these complaints to him. Of the six complaints I posed to him, he agreed with four. The only two items he took issue with have facts which do not support his view. In particular, regarding chapter 10 of the IPCC report, he stated that Bob Ward was right but that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier drafts discuss the same material but without a comprehensive assessment. Peculiarly there was a misattribution of estimates; and one key new study was overlooked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for us to move beyond these endless debates and begin working together on solutions that are cost effective ways to deal with climate&nbsp;change. The more we delay the greater will be the future costs to us and our children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of America's largest companies aren't taking the comprehensive actions required to tackle climate change, according to a new report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a car is hurtling at full speed towards the edge of a precipice, would it suffice to ease up a little on the gas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the perfect metaphor for how America's largest companies are responding to the rapidly worsening social and environmental challenges the world is facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest evidence that businesses are failing to grasp the need to restructure their business models comes from an analysis of 613 major publicly listed US companies, which represent three-quarters of the country's total stock market capitalisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report by Ceres, a non-profit focused on sustainable business, and Sustainalytics, a research firm focused on environmental, social and governance analysis, shows that while a small number of companies are showing leadership in some areas of sustainability, the vast majority are making progress that can at best be described as modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has been some incremental improvement across a number of measures since the research was last carried out in 2012, it is worrying that so few companies have incorporated any time-bound quantitative targets for improving their performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study highlights some of the setbacks, such as a decline in the percentage of water-intensive companies assessing water-related business risks, as well as a drop in the number of businesses (19%) that have strong sustainability policies and risk management systems in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change warning of the need for urgent action to limit the devastating impacts of climate&nbsp;change, two-thirds of the companies have failed to establish time-bound reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and 94% have not set quantitative targets to increase renewable energy sourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;US companies are simply not taking the comprehensive actions necessary - through energy efficiency, renewable energy procurement and other steps - to tackle climate&nbsp;change,&quot; says the report. &quot;Efforts to assess whether companies are reducing their GHG emissions are hampered by weak disclosure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Simply not enough'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another concern for the future is that of the 419 companies evaluated for innovation, 86% have adopted no formal programs to invest in and promote sustainability products and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's conclusion is stark: &quot;We are still not seeing the speed of change that is required - or the scale of innovation that is possible. Incremental progress in tackling global climate&nbsp;change and other sustainability threats is simply not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the acceleration of environmental and social challenges globally - floods, droughts and workplace tragedies, among them - corporate actions and solutions are not keeping pace with the required level of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative that many more companies shift from being reactive to proactive in embracing the sustainability challenges that lie ahead. The need for investors, businesses, NGOs and other stakeholders to fully engage in the essential work of creating a sustainable economy has never been more urgent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80% of the 613 companies were found to be failing to approach sustainability in a comprehensive fashion, and few are creating the incentives to spur improved performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few surprises in the list of companies considered to be showing leadership in individual areas, such as supply chain management and biodiversity. The list, which has not changed much in the last few years, includes the likes of Nike, Ford, Intel, Alcoa, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Starbucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report warns that &quot;treating sustainability as a stand-alone effort, or one that can be managed apart from the rest of the enterprise, is short-sighted and risky because sustainability is implicated in every decision, from product design and delivery to supply chain management.&quot; The comprehensive study looks at 20 measures that would suggest whether companies are integrating sustainability into their business systems and decision-making, based around the four key areas of governance, stakeholder engagement, disclosure and performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leadership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a third of the 613 companies' boards of directors formally oversee sustainability performance, while a quarter link executive compensation to sustainability performance. Even worse, only 3% link executive compensation to voluntary sustainability performance targets - such as greenhouse emission reductions - that go beyond goals required for compliance with laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says &quot;the significant number of companies with no visible management level oversight of sustainability is disappointing and must be improved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stakeholder engagement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over half the companies are engaging investors on sustainability issues, up from 40% in 2012, but only a tiny 3% are showing leadership by using multiple tactics such as integrating sustainability information into mainstream investor communications, highlighting sustainability performance and innovations at annual meetings, and directly engaging with shareholders on sustainability topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of companies disclose how they formally engage stakeholders on sustainability issues, but only 7% engage stakeholders in the materiality assessment process and disclose the insights gained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 40% have some programs in place to engage employees on sustainability issues, yet only 6% go further by systematically embedding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Procurement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a third of companies have established some form of engagement with suppliers on sustainability performance, just 14% have formal supply chain engagement programs in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water risks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 103 water-intensive companies evaluated, only half assess water-related business risks, a decline from the 55% in 2012. Only a quarter are prioritising efforts in water stressed regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-eight percent have supplier codes of conduct that address human rights in supply chains, compared to 43% in 2012, but 79% have no formal human right policies covering their direct employees and only 19% have policies that cover an employee's right to freedom of association and to collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biodiversity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most companies have policies and management systems that broadly address environmental issues, an evaluation of 126 companies across seven relevant sectors found only eight companies with a formal biodiversity policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention to biodiversity as a material business issue is especially lacking in the food and beverage, with only Molson Coors disclosing a formal policy, and the energy services sector which did not have a single company with a formal policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over half of US companies in the Ceres report evaluation publicly disclosing sustainability information, which compares poorly with the 93% of companies in the Global Fortune 500 that report that data. Less than one in 10 of the corporations seek out verification of their reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular concern is that more than half of the 30 companies in the oil and gas sector fail to publish a sustainability report. The study says: &quot;Due to the sector's high sustainability impacts and potential exposure to license to operate issues, this is a significant area where improvement is needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the vast majority of US companies are asleep at the wheel when it comes to facing up to multiple sustainability challenges, a select group is waking up to the need for urgent action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new report, Ceres, a non-profit focused on sustainable business, lambasted the lack of progress across American corporations in general - but also highlighted some companies that deserve praise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics would rightly say that there is not a single major corporation that is doing enough to adequately confront issues such as climate&nbsp;change and resource scarcity. But Ceres says a small but growing number of companies rank in the &quot;top tiers&quot; of performance across multiple disciplines, ranging from supply chain management to carbon emissions reductions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its latest research shows that &quot;companies with strong accountability systems - board oversight, clear policies on human rights and environmental management, active stakeholder engagement and disclosure - in many cases also have strong results on greenhouse gas emissions, use of renewable energy, strong work with suppliers, as well as driving sustainability into product and services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to encourage other businesses to take action, Ceres has shined the spotlight on the following companies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Board leadership: Alcoa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fifth of executive cash compensation is tied to safety, diversity and environmental stewardship, which includes greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions and energy efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stakeholder engagement: PepsiCo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The food and beverage company presents its sustainability strategy and goals during its annual shareholder meeting and identifies and discloses climate&nbsp;change, water scarcity and public health issues as core sustainability challenges in its annual financial filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Employee engagement: General Electric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE is using its human resource department to integrate sustainability into the company's culture, ranging from hiring practices and training to employee wellbeing programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Water stewardship: Coca-Cola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drinks company has improved the efficiency of its water use by 20% and identified the need for a rigorous third-party evaluation of its water management approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Supply chain management: Ford Motor Company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car company has established requirements for first-tier suppliers to drive its environmental and social expectations further down the supply chain and works with suppliers to establish GHG emission reduction and energy efficiency targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Innovation: Nike</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sports-gear multinational integrates sustainable design across its product portfolio and created the Making app in 2013, allowing the data in its materials sustainability index to be public. This lets designers from across the industry and beyond make more sustainable design decisions, and ultimately, lower-impact products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Management accountability: Xylem </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global water technology provider has both a sustainability steering committee and an enterprise risk committee. It identifies senior executives who are held accountable for sustainability performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Executive compensation: Exelon </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy producer has introduced an innovative long-term performance share scheme that rewards executives for meeting non-financial performance goals, including safety targets, GHG emissions reduction targets and goals engaging stakeholders to help shape the company's public policy positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Biodiversity: PG&amp;E</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The utility company's environmental policy explicitly references habitat and species protection, and the company publicly reports detailed findings on its efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Investor dialogue: Starbuck's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the coffee company's 2013 shareholder meeting, CEO Howard Schultz described the company's efforts to engage with suppliers and local communities where they operate, accelerate investments in sustainable farming and reach Starbucks' goal of ethically sourcing 100% of its coffee beans by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Disclosure: Brown-Forman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major distributor of wine and spirits uses ingredients that are both climate sensitive and water intensive. In its 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it demonstrates that it sees sustainability as a way to build consumer relationships and enduring brands. It cites climate&nbsp;change, water scarcity and water quality as significant business risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Greenhouse gas emission reductions: Adobe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The software company aims to achieve a 75% reduction, from 2000 levels, in company emissions by 2015.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pharmaceutical and consumer goods manufacturer has a detailed policy that incorporates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It applies these principles not just in its overseas operations and supply chain, but also to all its workplaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sustainable agriculture: General Mills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foods company recently released a set of sustainable sourcing commitments that begins with a robust risk assessment process undertaken in partnership with a third party. This approach led the company to prioritise ten commodities, including oats, wheat and corn, that they plan to source sustainably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Transportation: Walmart</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retail giant is committed to doubling its truck fleet efficiency in the US by 2015. To achieve this goal, it is replacing nearly two-thirds of its fleet with more fuel-efficient trucks, including hybrids. The company is also collaborating with truck and component manufacturers to build energy-efficient prototype tractors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In a major victory for the Obama administration, the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the smog from coal plants that drifts across state lines from 28 Midwestern and Appalachian states to the East Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6-to-2 ruling bolsters the centerpiece of President Obama's environmental agenda: a series of new regulations aimed at cutting pollution from coal-fired power plants. Republicans and the coal industry have criticized the regulations, which use the Clean Air Act as their legal authority, as a ''war on coal.'' The industry has waged an aggressive legal battle to undo the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts said the decision, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, signals that the Obama administration's efforts to use the Clean Air Act to fight global warming could withstand legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the E.P.A. is expected to propose a sweeping new Clean Air Act regulation to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that scientists say is the chief cause of climate change. Coal plants are the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a big win for the E.P.A., and not just because it has to do with this rule,'' said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard. ''It's the fact that it's setting the stage and creating momentum for what's to come.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Supreme Court had decided against the Obama administration in Tuesday's decision, Ms. Freeman said, ''it would have been a shot across the bow to the E.P.A. as it takes the next steps'' toward putting out the climate change regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court decision is only the latest blow to coal. Also on Tuesday, a Federal District Court ordered the E.P.A. to propose by Dec. 1 a new nationwide regulation to rein in smog pollution from coal-fired power plants and other major polluters. This rule would come on top of the regulation covering cross-state air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.P.A. had been preparing to issue that regulation in 2011, but President Obama told the agency to delay it after his advisers warned that it could hurt his re-election chances in coal-reliant swing states like Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld another major E.P.A. Clean Air Act rule that would cut coal-plant pollution from mercury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Today's Supreme Court decision is a resounding victory for public health and a key component of E.P.A.'s efforts to make sure all Americans have clean air to breathe,'' Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. She added that ''the court's finding also underscores the importance of basing the agency's efforts on strong legal foundations and sound science.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interstate air pollution regulation, also known as the ''good neighbor'' rule, has pitted Rust Belt and Appalachian states like Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky against East Coast states like New York and Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its arguments before the court, the E.P.A. said the rules were necessary to protect the health and the environment of downwind states. East Coast states in particular are vulnerable to pollution blown by the prevailing west-to-east winds of the United States. The soot and smog produced by coal plants are linked to asthma, lung disease and premature death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her decision, Justice Ginsburg noted that in reining in interstate pollution, regulators must account for the vagaries of the wind. ''Some pollutants stay within upwind states' borders, the wind carries others to downwind states, and some subset of that group drifts to states without air quality problems,'' she wrote, adding a biblical quotation from the Book of John: ''The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said the regulation was unwieldy and suggested it was Marxist. As written, the regulation will require upwind polluting states to cut pollution in relation to the amounts of pollution each state produces, but also as a proportion of how affordably a state can make the cuts. In other words, states that are able to more cost-effectively reduce pollution will be required to cut more of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I fully acknowledge that the proportional-reduction approach will demand some complicated computations where one upwind state is linked to multiple downwind states and vice versa,'' Justice Scalia wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am confident, however, that E.P.A.'s skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the statute's quantitative (rather than efficiency) mandate by crafting quantitative solutions. Indeed, those calculations can be performed at the desk, whereas the 'from each according to its ability' approach requires the unwieldy field examination of many pollution-producing sources with many sorts of equipment,'' he said, paraphrasing Karl Marx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself from the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The utilities and 15 states opposed to the regulations argued that the rules, as written by the Obama administration, gave the E.P.A. too much authority and placed an unfair economic burden on the polluting states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision will force coal plant owners to install costly ''scrubber'' technology to curb smokestack pollution of smog-forming chemicals. Many owners have said the regulation would be so expensive to carry out that they expected to shut down their oldest and dirtiest coal plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans in Congress denounced the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is just the latest blow to jobs and affordable energy,'' Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Edward Whitfield, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement. Both are from states that rely heavily on cheap coal-fired electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added: ''The administration's overreaching regulation will drive up energy costs and threaten jobs and electric reliability. We cannot allow E.P.A.'s aggressive regulatory expansion to go unchecked. We will continue our oversight of the agency and our efforts to protect American families and workers from E.P.A.'s onslaught of costly rules.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2011, the Obama administration issued the ''good neighbor'' rule, which was to apply to 28 states east of Nebraska -- half of the country -- but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck it down, ruling that the E.P.A. had not followed the Clean Air Act when it calculated how to assign responsibility for cross-state air pollution. The Supreme Court's ruling overturned that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governors from East Coast states have for more than 15 years been subject to tougher air pollution requirements than other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The East Coast governors have long criticized the Appalachian and Rust Belt states for their more lenient rules on pollution from coal plants, factories and tailpipes -- allowing those state economies to profit from cheap energy while their smog and soot have been carried eastward by prevailing winds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Vatican hosts a meeting considering the mix of science, technology and values-laden choices that will determine the quality of life &amp;#8212; human and otherwise &amp;#8212; on Earth in coming decades. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm headed to the Vatican to participate in a novel workshop at which economists, theologians and seasoned researchers from many branches of science convene under the auspices of the Pontifical Academies of Sciences and Social Sciences to consider a subject that transcends the realms of data and values:&nbsp;Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Planet, Our Responsibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My role will be to offer a concluding comment after four days of presentations and discussion. You can explore the agenda and list of participants here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably, the meeting will help inform Pope Francis, who, according to the National Catholic Register, is preparing an encyclical on &quot;human ecology.&quot; (Pope Benedict XVImade the environment a priority, as well.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the planning goes back at least a year or two and the main organizers are Partha Sarathi Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, Veerabhadran Ramanathan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, San Diego, focused on reducing sooty pollution and climate&nbsp;change, and Archbishop Roland Minnerath of Dijon, France, who is also a professor of history and ethics at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men explain their goals this way in conference documents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our idea is not to catalogue environmental problems. We propose instead to view Humanity's interchanges with Nature through a triplet of fundamental, but inter-related Human needs - Food, Health, and Energy - and ask our respective Academies to work together to invite experts from the natural and the social sciences to speak of the various pathways that both serve those needs and reveal constraints on Nature's ability to meet them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll be reporting back on Twitter (@revkin) and here as much as time allows.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the fossil fuel industry made fancy ice cream, what flavour would it be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe a dollop of Triple Fossil Ripple with luscious layers of coal, gas and shale oil?&nbsp;How about a bowl of Lignite Wonderland? Anyone for Coal Briquette Cookie Dough?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would you be tempted by the slick marketing of that tub of Clean Coal Fantasy Truffle, only to find the tub is entirely empty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we entice you with our&nbsp;Cool Blue Ocean Acidifier with a topping of crumbled reef coral?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'd have to presume that were any of these flavours actually real, they'd be going straight into Andrew Powell's freezer.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell is the Liberal environment minister in the coal-friendly state of Queensland in Australia, where a propaganda war is currently playing out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell has called on Australians to boycott the Unilever-owned Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream brand for its very public and active support of a campaign to &quot;raise awareness&quot; of how the Great Barrier Reef is &quot;at serious risk from intensive dredging, mega ports and shipping highways&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, final approvals were granted to dump three million cubic metres of dredged ocean bottom into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to make way for a new coal terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference, Powell presented a media release and told reporters: &quot;The only people taking a scoop out of the reef are Ben and Jerry's and Unilever. If you understand the facts, you'd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerry's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WWF-Australia campaign that Ben &amp; Jerry's backed was &quot;scandalous&quot;, Powell said, and was a &quot;campaign of lies and deceit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell's call for a boycott comes with mine-sized scoops of irony, given his own party is interested in changing consumer law to ban environment groups from calling for products or companies to be boycotted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign in question is called&nbsp;Fight For The Reef&nbsp;and is being run by WWF-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (Greenpeace also has its own campaign flavour -&nbsp;Save The Reef).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are coal-backed reef ads telling the full story?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a response to these campaigns, the Queensland Resources Council representing mining and fossil fuel companies last week launched television adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over footage of the reef, the voiceover says: &quot;The Great Barrier Reef has lost almost half its coral cover. The culprits are storms (48 per cent), crown of thorns starfish (42 per cent) and coral bleaching (10 per cent). Not shipping and not ports. The reef facts are clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advert cites a 2012 study from the Government-backed Australian Institute of Marine Science, published in the leading US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study did say that storms, starfish attacks and coral bleaching were responsible for the dramatic loss of coral cover on the reef.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what's causing the Crown of Thorns (COTS) outbreaks and what else did the study say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm going to cite lots of it because this is the study the mining industry is trying to claim backs its case (my bolding).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GBR has been subject to severe disturbances, including COTS outbreaks, mass coral bleaching and declining growth rates of coral due to increasing seawater temperatures, terrestrial runoff, tropical cyclones, and coral diseases...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also strong evidence that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">water quality affects the frequency of COTS outbreaks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the central and southern GBR...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching are of major concern, and are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">directly attributable to rising atmospheric greenhouse gases</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. To date, the GBR has lost fewer corals to bleaching and diseases than many other regions in the world, but</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> bleaching mortality will almost certainly increase</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the GBR, given the upward trend in temperatures...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without significant changes to the rates of disturbance and coral growth, coral cover in the central and southern regions of the GBR is likely to decline to 5-10% by 2022. The future of the GBR therefore depends on decisive action. Although world governments continue to debate the need to cap greenhouse gas emissions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">reducing the local and regional pressures is one way to strengthen the natural resilience of ecosystems</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is a study the mining and resources industry thinks backs its plans for increasing exports of fossil fuels, then I would hate to see a report that doesn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resilient reef</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked James Cook University's Professor Terry Hughes, a director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, for his view on the adverts.&nbsp;He told me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not scientifically accurate to claim that cyclones are killing off the Reef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real issue is to ask, why are reefs away from people still perfectly able to recover from cyclones, as they always have, while polluted reefs nearer to the coast are in rapid decline? Pollution is the culprit, not cyclones which are part of the natural dynamic of the Reef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Killing starfish is akin to swatting a locust storm with a butterfly net. The only lasting solution is to reduce runoff and ban dredging and dumping anywhere near the GBR World Heritage Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The QRC ads make no mention of the impact of burning coal and gas on greenhouse gas emissions, on climate change and on the vulnerability of coral reefs to rising temperatures and ocean acidification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An experimental study, also published in the PNAS journal last year, has recreated the kind of conditions Great Barrier Reef corals will have to cope with as waters warm and the oceans become more acidic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've seen this experiment first hand. Healthy reef organisms become collections of slimy, dead and bleached corals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland's Global Change Institute, has been researching on the reef for 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told me the mining industry adverts &quot;don't tell the full story&quot;, adding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The resilience of the reef is very much in the hands of water quality. The ability of the reef to grow back after COTS events and cyclones is essentially indexed to how well corals are growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already have higher levels of pollutants along the coastline and so the ability of the corals to bounce back is highly compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything that leads to reduction of growth and the ability of corals to bounce back from disturbances - and that includes dredging and port development - presents a real conundrum on the issue of keeping the reef healthy while at the same time as trying to export these commodities which themselves have an impact on climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a lose lose situation all the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoegh-Guldberg said it was &quot;not accurate&quot; to claim there had been no studies linking ports and shipping to a reduction in environmental quality on the reef.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one example, he pointed to the 2003 Productivity Commission report into the reef. A section on &quot;port activity&quot; says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various potential water quality issues can arise from port and shipping activities, including those due to: dredging of channels and berths (which can result in short-term turbidity) and placement of dredged material at sea; runoff from land (including stormwater from product stockpiles and partially developed sites); reclamation of habitats (wetlands), with potential implications for runoff; antifouling paints and waste discharge from ships; and shipping incidents and accidents, and marine oil spills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report does list a number of management practices that can mitigate the problems, but it does not consider (or even mention) the impacts of climate change being driven by the fossil fuels flowing through the port developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To claim that ice creams are an enemy of the reef but building ports and encouraging fossil fuel burning are not, is a whole tub of something - and it's not triple chocolate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafeez Ahmed: Breitbart comes to London, and the results are a sorry stain on British journalism</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Roy Greenslade reported that US conservative media outfit Breitbart News Network was expanding into the British media scene with the establishment of a London office. Heading up Breitbart's new UK operations are executive editor James Delingpole and managing editor Raheem Kassem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expansion - which Delingpole himself effectively concedes is about &quot;pandering to readers' prejudices&quot; to maximise profits - reveals the worrying extent to which the forces behind climate denial and racism are one and the same: &quot;American conservativism&quot; of the &quot;right-wing libertarianist&quot; kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-science</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Delingpole's track record of fundamentalist opposition to climate science at the Telegraph, it is hardly surprising that Breitbart UK's environmental reporting standards sink to an unprecedented low.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one story this month, for instance, Delingpole lauded a new US poll which found that: &quot;More Americans believe in God than in man-made global warming.&quot; Only thirty-three per cent of respondents, the poll showed, are confident that average global temperatures are rising mostly due to human-caused greenhouse gasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delingpole mockingly dismissed the explanation of Nobel Prize winning biochemist, Prof Robert Leftkowitz: that public opinion is being misled by &quot;the force of concerted campaigns to discredit scientific fact&quot; - largely funded by the fossil fuel industry, as documented in a recent extensive study in Climatic Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, said Delingpole:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps he should venture out of the biochemistry lab a bit more often. If he did so, he would realise that the 67 per cent who had doubts about greenhouse gas theory are almost certainly correct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delingpole's scientific evidence for this is the alleged inability of broadly accurate if conservative (rather than alarmist) computer models to account for &quot;real world data&quot; - data which he completely fails to understand, hence his endorsement of the fictional &quot;pause in global warming since 1997.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-activism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, another story this month by Breitbart political correspondent, Andre Walker - a former Tory political aide who resigned after being caught plotting to smear a deputy council leader - lent unwarranted credence to a new report by the anti-climate policy advocacy group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of GWPF's funders is Tory Party donor Michael Hintze, head of $5bn hedge-fund CQS which operates in the oil finance industry, among other areas. The report claimed that &quot;environmentalism&quot; had come to &quot;permeate school curricula across the UK,&quot; resulting in children being &quot;brainwashed&quot; by climate&nbsp;change activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker's story on the report quoted a spokesman for British education minister Michael Gove, saying that teachers who do not offer a &quot;balanced&quot; view on climate&nbsp;change issues are breaking the law. &quot;There has been concern for a number of years about teachers using the classroom to preach radical ideas,&quot; commented Walker, before throwing in a bone for his former party: &quot;The Thatcher government introduced the National Curriculum in 1988 because some schools spent so much time on 'trendy' causes that they had little time left for the basics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While attacking environmental science and activism, Breitbart UK simultaneously revels in being an unadulterated mouthpiece for right-wing ideology without even a semblance of editorial objectivity. Literally dozens of 'news' articles over the last month, many by editor Raheem Kassam, offer gushing praise for the anti-environmentalist UK Independence Party (Ukip) - which as far right expert Dr Matthew Goodwin of the University of Nottingham explains, has &quot;considerable overlaps with the extreme right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Far from being 'xenophobic' or 'racist',&quot; Kassam writes instead, &quot;Ukip's objections to mass immigration into Britain&quot; are merely a reaction to the Blair government's policy of &quot;'open borders' immigration from Europe.&quot; He whines that Ukip is &quot;often unfairly lumped&quot; with the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare Kassam's unbridled enthusiasm for Ukip with the sober assessment of Dan Hodges in The Telegraph, who explains how his views on the party have changed as the party's racism has become increasingly obvious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past year Ukip has gone beyond raising general concerns about immigration to directly targeting and stigmatising individual national groups. Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians and Albanians are amongst the favourite targets. And, as Nigel Farage said at the weekend, he believes that's fine because they represent national, not racial stereotypes. But of course it isn't fine... Ukip is now an overtly racist and extremist party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, in a damning overview in yesterday's Spectator, Nick Cohen decisively highlights the systematic pattern of overt xenophobia on the part of Ukip candidates and representatives, demolishing the myth of the party's love of Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kill 'em all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breitbart's hysterically partisan support for Ukip is no innocuous error of judgement. On 2nd April, Breitbart columnist Patrick Dollard tweeted this in response to the Fort Hoot shooting last month by an Iraq War veteran - the same Texas base where former US Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people in 2009:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is even one more act of Muslim terrorism, it is then time for Americans to start slaughtering Muslims in the street, all of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being widely reported and condemned, to date Dollard has not deleted or apologised for this statement, and Breitbart.com continues to list him as a columnist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legitimising far right extremism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that the Breitbart phenomenon represents just one strand of an increasingly entrenched web of neoconservative influence that is working hard to legitimise far right extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breitbart UK's managing editor, Raheem Kassem, is an Associate Fellow at the leading London neocon think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), where he was marketing and communications director from 2010 to 2013. The Henry Jackson Society was criticised in 2012 by founding HJS member and former director Dr Marko Attila Hoare, a historian at Kingston University, who complained that the Society:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... has become an abrasively right-wing forum with an anti-Muslim tinge, churning out polemical and superficial pieces by aspiring journalists and pundits that pander to a narrow readership of extreme Europhobic British Tories, hardline US Republicans and Israeli Likudniks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While running pro-Ukip spin in the name of journalism, Kassem is also long-time director of 'Student Rights,' which describes itself as an &quot;independent&quot; anti-extremism &quot;campus monitoring group,&quot; despite actually being a HJS-funded project sharing the same office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student Rights has come under fire recently from motions passed by multiple Student Unions at London universities for &quot;disproportionately and unfairly targeting Muslim students, contributing to their marginalisation and ostracisation, damaging campus cohesion and feeding into a growing trend of Islamophobic discourse in wider society.&quot; The motions note that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Student Rights' work and reporting has been used by far-right groups to target a Muslim-student event which led to reported threats of violence and the event subsequently having to be cancelled by the university.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Student Rights' directors deny this - pointing to some recent work on far right extremism - according to the Institute for Race Relations (IRR) &quot;the majority of its work has been on 'Islamic extremist' events&quot; and &quot;its counter-extremism agenda shares some aspects of the far Right's framework about Islam and the Left.&quot; The group - which does not actually represent any students - has according to IRR opposed student activist &quot;events in support of Palestinian causes; events in solidarity with Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer (labeled an Al Qaeda operative); and Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HJS project's far right sympathies go back to its founding in 2009. London Student, the newspaper of the University of London Union, reports that the same year, Student Rights criticised the London School of Economics Student Union for passing a 'no platform' policy on fascist groups, including the British National Party (BNP). A Student Rights editorial characterised this policy as &quot;another example&quot; of unions &quot;limiting free speech on campus&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BNP is a legitimate political party... Student Rights draws the line at violence and hate-speech, but this doesn't tend to be the topic for most BNP members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That editorial is no longer available on the website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bizarre Breitbart marriage between climate-denying Delingpole and extremism-obsessed Kassem is perhaps not all that bizarre. It represents the disturbing logic of how Anglo-American neoconservative ideology is attempting to influence public and politics by harnessing anti-science discourse and rehabilitating the extreme right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both these activities happen to support two intertwined goals: empowering Anglo-American control of Middle East fossil fuels, and criminalising peaceful activism that could undermine this control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the neocons like to pretend they're fighting for freedom and liberty, it's obvious they stand far apart from these basic democratic values.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you had driven north on Highway 101 toward San Francisco a few summers ago, you might have noticed a banner hanging from a freeway bridge. ''What have future generations done for us?'' it asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question not only answers itself, but implies a follow-up question, as was presumably the intention of the anonymous provocateur who posted it. If future generations have given us nothing, should we spend our hard-earned money trying to make the world better for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue has long hovered over discussions of climate&nbsp;change, but it came into acute focus over the past few weeks as two new reports were released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate&nbsp;Change, the United Nations body that periodically reviews the science and economics of the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists have struggled for decades to understand what might happen to the earth, physically, if we continue pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at ever-rising rates. They have made some headway, but the uncertainties remain substantial. The worst-case possibilities are deeply frightening, but the likelihood they will become a reality is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the more difficult, then, is the task of figuring out what the projected climatic changes might do to human society, which is in large part an economic question. How severe will the damages be; what present-day policies might reduce them; what will those policies cost; and are they a worthwhile investment compared to the many alternatives for spending our money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling these issues is not for the timid, but some economists do it for a living. They have to take the best projections they can get from physical scientists, then incorporate these into elaborate numerical models of how the economy will evolve over the coming centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you might imagine, the results depend on many assumptions, and particularly on the question of how much value to attach in the present to the hypothesized suffering of future people. You can find arguments in economic journals for spending nothing on climate&nbsp;change, and arguments that we should be spending trillions of dollars to head off the apocalypse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most economists who do this work come down in the middle. Their analyses tend to suggest that, because we have dawdled so long, the economic damage from climate&nbsp;change is going to be substantial, no matter what we do from here. They also generally find that this damage is likely to be dwarfed by bigger economic trends unrelated to climate, like the evolution of technology and shifts in population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite those findings, the typical economic analysis suggests that it is still worth trying to limit climate&nbsp;change -- in other words, not only can the damage be reduced somewhat, but the future benefits of doing so outweigh the current costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most economists in the field think the rational thing to do is to put a price on emissions of greenhouse gases, which would in turn raise the price of gasoline and of electricity generated from coal. That would discourage emissions in the short run -- people might, say, buy more efficient cars or better insulate their houses to avoid higher bills -- and it would tilt the market in favor of cleaner energy sources in the long run. It would also have some valuable side benefits, like cleaning up the localized pollution from coal-burning power plants that is chopping years off people's lives in Chinese cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what should the price of greenhouse emissions be? This is where things get sticky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you wanted only to reduce the damages that are virtually certain to occur, you might come up with a pretty low number -- say, a few extra cents tacked on at the gas pump. But that course would rest on the assumption that climate&nbsp;change will proceed fairly smoothly. In other words, what we will see might look a lot like the changes we have already seen, except gradually more intense. Human society might adjust to that pretty well through normal market behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the United Nations panel pointed out, the physical scientists see a distinct risk that things will not work that way. We might cross some temperature threshold beyond which a rapid, highly disruptive change in the climate would occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know this can happen because it has happened in the earth's geologic history, before seven billion people were in harm's way. For instance, as the last ice age was ending, glaciers melted so fast at one point that the sea level rose at the rate of perhaps a foot per decade, 10 times faster than today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suppose we were to spew enough heat-trapping gas into the air to produce a rapid collapse of the polar ice sheets and thus a rapid rise of sea level. Human society could be thrown into panic. Tens of millions of people might have to be moved. Trillions of dollars of productive capital, including many of the world's major coastal cities, might have to be abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the likelihood of this sort of thing is unknown, economists cannot really figure out how to work such risks into their economic models. But they certainly understand them in principle. That is why many of them recommend that we push harder on climate policies than we otherwise might -- in other words, set a higher emissions price -- to buy ourselves some insurance against the worst-case possibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether you agree with that is not, in the end, an economic question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a question of how much you believe you owe those living in the future -- not just your own children or grandchildren, but the generations of people who will come long after we are gone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, typhoon Bopha redefined how big a typhoon could get; a year later, Haiyan blew that redefinition out of the water. We need to channel funding into preparation and resilience</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 2013, typhoon Haiyan delivered destruction to the Philippines and a stark message that the world is underprepared for the violence of climate&nbsp;change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of typhoons hit the Philippines every season but this was not just another storm. Climate scientists have long predicted that as the Earth warms extreme weather events will become more extreme. Haiyan was a marker of how far we have gone down that road. Its unprecedented power and devastation gave us an insight into a dangerous future in which climate&nbsp;change fuels weather of hitherto-unimagined ferocity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aid agencies say Haiyan is likely to just be the overture. The rising intensity of tropical storms, combined with their increasingly unseasonal timings, means rebuilding may be incomplete when the next super typhoon hits. This would compound the disaster into a catastrophe. Tariq Reibl, Oxfam's humanitarian response manager for the Philippines, says that climate&nbsp;change will mean destructive storms, disastrous enough in isolation, will increasingly occur in procession.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're looking at about 20 typhoons per year for the Philippines and as a whole those 20 are going to be more powerful. And then, one or potentially two of those 20 in the future would be a super typhoon ... that is something that we didn't see 10 years ago,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam's Haiyan recovery operation is currently costing &pound;1m every week. And yet, six months after the event, the rebuild is only just beginning. Reibl says small but unseasonal storms have continually diverted resources away from the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reibl says: &quot;If there is another storm that is even close to Haiyan ... there could be higher death tolls, there could be much worse impact because the resilience that existed previously is all down. Everything was destroyed in Haiyan, in terms of evacuation centres, in terms of livelihoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The damage Haiyan caused outstripped any storm the typhoon-prone islands had experienced before. Reibl says typhoon Bopha in 2012 had already redefined ideas on how big a typhoon could get, and yet &quot;just a year later, Haiyan made Bopha seem like just a little wind ... When Bopha happened we didn't envisage a Haiyan. Can we envisage something more than Haiyan?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reibl says that in the past the Philippines were considered the 7-11 of natural disasters - small but open all hours. Indonesia, with its large but infrequent disasters, was more like a mega mall. He says the scale of devastation wrought by Haiyan meant the Philippines had become &quot;a mega mall that is now also open 24/7&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Warsaw climate talks, which started just three days after Haiyan hit the coast, the Philippines' UN representative Yeb Sano captured the attention of the world as he pleaded with leaders to attend to the catastrophe in his homeland and act to &quot;prevent a future where super typhoons become a way of life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chris Field, one of the authors of the UN's recent report on the impacts of climate&nbsp;change, says the intensity of storms is already increasing. &quot;We are now in an era where climate&nbsp;change isn't some kind of future hypothetical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was really scary about Haiyan, says Paul Jenkins, head of partnership development at the Red Cross, was that it happened in a country that was considered well prepared for this type of disaster. &quot;You can imagine if that kind of event had struck a country with less good logistics, less structures, less government capacity it could have been absolutely catastrophic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Spalton, disaster risk reduction specialist at Unicef, says a major part of preparing for extreme weather events is community education. During Haiyan, many people died because they did not know what a storm surge was and stayed with their properties. Unicef has created region-specific curriculums for schools to teach children how to respond in disaster situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins says that, while &quot;mega-events&quot; such as Haiyan receive the majority of interest and resources, the full impact of climate&nbsp;change will be subtler and much greater. &quot;If you look at a global picture, the issue is that [climate&nbsp;change] is already there and it's not necessarily about mega-events, it's about increasing vulnerability due to climate&nbsp;change.&quot; He says the &quot;collective impact over a year&quot; of changing seasonality, crop impacts, drought and sea level rise &quot;will vastly exceed the number of people affected by a Haiyan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spalton says the effects of climate&nbsp;change will be felt worst in regions prone to floods, droughts or storms. As a result, Unicef has shifted the emphasis of many of its programmes towards preparing for climate-change-related disasters. &quot;While there may not be new funding available, there's a recognition that the funding we do have needs to be orientated differently to these global trends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spalton says the scale of the problem is such that existing funding is inadequate for providing protection to vulnerable communities. This will only get worse as the effects of climate&nbsp;change become more pronounced. Jenkins says climate&nbsp;change is now the biggest driver of change in the way aid funding is spent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson has announced plans for the London mayor's office to become the UK's latest electricity supplier with an official launch next year of a scheme aimed at lowering bills and bolstering the capital's energy independence. London will be the first public authority to receive a &quot;junior&quot; electricity licence from industry regulator Ofgem as part of the plan to produce 25% of the capital's power from local sources by 2025.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy for London, as the scheme is likely to be named, will initially buy power from small-scale generators owned by London boroughs and public bodies and then sell it on to Transport for London and the Metropolitan police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nurturing a new crop of small, low-carbon energy producers across the capital is the key to a more secure, cost-effective and sustainable energy supply for us all. Investing in locally sourced power will help keep fuel bills down and drive innovation, jobs and growth in this city's burgeoning low-carbon sector,&quot; said Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve boroughs and waste authorities have been earmarked as having generating schemes that could benefit from the expected 30% premium that Energy for London would pay, compared with the private-sector market, which deals only in the purchase of large quantities of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's move is backed by Ed Davey, the energy and climate&nbsp;change secretary, who said it could help break the near stranglehold of the big six firms. &quot;Opening up our energy market to smaller companies is good news for competition and therefore for consumers. This is part of my vision to help to meet the UK's energy and climate&nbsp;change challenges, supporting a sustainable and secure energy system, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering consumer bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
